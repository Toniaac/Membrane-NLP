[29] respectively introduced lignin and polyvinyl chloride-graft-poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PVC-g-PEGMA) into the PVC substrate to obviously improve the membranes' flux, indicating an increase in hydrophilicity. However, the flux recovery ratio (FRR) was relatively low, which indicated that the antifouling property was not improved significantly. Besides, Wang et al. [15] prepared poly (vinyl chloride-co-acrylonitrile-co-sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) (PVC-PAN-PSS) membranes with improved antifouling property. Fang et al. [19] modified PVC substrate by blending it with poly (methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine-co-poly (propylene glycol) methacrylate (MPC-co-PPGMA) to achieve high FRR (>97%). Whereas, pure water permeability (PWP) of the membranes mentioned in Refs. [15] and [19] was low. Furthermore, Fang et al. [12] and Fan et al. [13] respectively blended poly(methyl methacrylate)-graft-poly (ethylene glycol) (PMMA-g-PEG) and polyvinyl formal (PVF) to fabricate the PVC substrate for high performance in term of hydrophilicity and antifouling properties. The above results in Refs. [6,12,13,15,19,29] confirms that: 1) It is an effective method to introduce amphiphilic copolymers into PVC substrate; 2) Amphiphilic copolymers improve the certain aspects of the properties including PWP, separation and antifouling properties, however, they may weaken the other aspects of them. Therefore, it is feasible and of great value to seek for a novel modifier to further improve overall properties of PVC membranes.",364,"Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used membrane material because of its excellent mechanical strength, superior physical and chemical stability, low-cost (<1/10 price of polysulfone, polyethersulfone, polyimide, and polyvinylidene fluoride), outstanding acid and alkali tolerance [23,24]. Therefore, in the field of membrane fabrication, PVC has greater competitive advantages than other polymers. However, the inherent hydrophobicity of PVC membrane is readily subject to high-degree fouling [6,15,25], and it is imperative to improve its hydrophilicity [26]. Hence, polymer blending modification methods for the PVC membrane hydrophilicity have been widely used by researchers.

It can be seen that whether it is a porous CMPSf membrane or a dense CMPSf membrane, they have almost no selective separation performance for Mg2+ and Li+, and their separation factors are close to 1.0. This is because there is no functional group on the CMPSf membrane that selectively adsorbs Mg2+ or Li+.

130,130,"The transmembrane voltage affects the intensity of the electric field and the migration rate of Li+ and Mg2+. The results of the influence of the transmembrane voltage on the separation factor are shown in Fig. 7. When the voltage is 0 V, magnesium and lithium ions migrate to the cathode chamber under the driving force of the concentration difference. Because the dense membrane of PSf-sg-AB12C4 has a small pore size and a low ion penetration rate, the separation factor is only 3.0. As the voltage increases, the separation factor increases significantly. When the voltage is 0.5 V, a is 23.1. Furthermore, as the voltage increases to 2 V, a reaches the highest value of 32.6. This is because the voltage rises, the electric field strength increases, and the electric field driving force for ion migration also increases. As a result, the transmembrane migration rate of magnesium ions with higher mobility from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber is accelerated. During the migration process, Li+ are adsorbed by the PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane and cannot migrate freely to the cathode compartment. Therefore, as the voltage rises, the migration rate of Mg2+ to the cathode chamber increases, the number of migrated ions also grows. This results in separation factor increasing with the increment of voltage. Further increasing the voltage to 3 V, the separation factor did not change significantly.

As the voltage increases, the separation factor increases significantly. When the voltage is 0.5 V, a is 23.1. Furthermore, as the voltage increases to 2 V, a reaches the highest value of 32.6. This is because the voltage rises, the electric field strength increases, and the electric field driving force for ion migration also increases.

Fig. 8 shows the separation performance of the PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane for Mg2+ and Li+ under different metal ion concentrations (the concentrations of Mg2+ and Li+are the same). It can be seen from the figure that as the ion concentration rises, the separation factor increases. When the concentration of Mg2+ and Li+ are both 0.1 mol*L - 1, the separation factor is only 5.4. However, when the Mg2+ and Li+ concentrations increase to 0.5 mol*L - 1, the separation factor is as high as 32.2. The diffusion of ions from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber is affected by two aspects. One is the electric field force between the two pole pieces, and the other is the concentration difference between the anode and the cathode. Due to the selective adsorption of Li+ on the PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane, the increase in ion concentration can promote the improvement of adsorption capacity and adsorption rate for Li+by the membrane when Li+ diffuse from the high-concentration side (anode) to the low-concentration side (cathode). For Mg2+, the increase in concentration can accelerate its diffusion rate. Therefore, increasing the ion concentration and enlarging the concentration difference between the two pole pieces will help increase the separation factor of Mg2+ and Li+. What's more, further increasing the concentration over 0.5 mol*L - 1 has little effect on the separation factor.

140,140,"The basic membrane performance and efficiency characteristics are selectivity, water flux rate, fouling properties, chemical/mechanical/thermal stabilities, and service durability under the operating conditions. Surface properties, such as hydrophilicity, roughness, and mean pore size and structure, greatly affect the membrane fouling behavior and its lifespan (Lee et al., 2016). Depending on the mean size of the pores, wastewater treatment membranes can be classified into four main categories, i.e., microfiltration, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and reverse osmosis (Padaki et al., 2015b). Among the different available membrane materials for wastewater treatment, polymers are widely used because of their low cost, tunable pore structure, and ease of scaling. Examples include polysulfone (PSF) (Saljoughi and Mousavi, 2012), polyethersulfone (PES) (Ahmad et al., 2013), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Yuliwati and Ismail, 2011), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Safarpour et al., 2021), and cellulose acetate (CA) (Goossens and Van Haute, 1976). PSF is especially of interest because of its excellent film forming capability and good chemical and thermal stabilities. However, membranes made of PSF are hydrophobic, resulting in decreased water flux and increased tendency to fouling. As a result, their operating costs are higher than other similar membranes and their service life is shorter. One of the common ways to improve the polymer membrane performance is to incorporate inorganic nanomaterials in the polymer matrix to yield nanocomposite membranes with tailored properties (Kim et al., 2014). For example, high fouling tendency and low water flux in hydrophobic polymer membranes can be reduced by adding only small amounts of hydrophilic inorganic nanomaterials to the polymer matrix (Bakshi et al., 2021; Safikhani et al., 2021) Production of these membranes is mainly carried out by the phase inversion, or more specifically nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method.

166,166,"Presence of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes affects their top surface topology and roughness. The observed changes can be attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the polymer chains and functional groups on the nanoparticles at the membrane surface among others (Esmaeili et al., 2010; Sears et al., 2010). In Fig. 3S., the 3D AFM images of the neat PSF and PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes are shown. Moreover, the membrane surface roughness parameters, i.e., average roughness (Sa), highest peak (Sz), root mean square of the Z data (Sq), and difference between the highest and lowest peaks (Sy) are given in Table 2. The dark and light areas in the AFM images represent valleys (pores) and peaks on the membrane surface, respectively. There is a direct correlation between the membrane surface roughness and its antifouling performance, namely as the surface roughness of the membrane decreases, its antifouling performance increases due to the fact that foulants are less likely to be trapped on a soft surface (Vatanpour et al., 2021b). Based on the data presented in Table 2, a steady decrease in the membrane surface roughness is observed with the addition of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles to the PSF membrane up to a nanoparticle concentration of 1 wt%. The slight increase in the surface roughness of the 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane compared to the surface roughness of membranes with lower nanoparticle concentrations is attributed to the increased nanoparticle agglomeration in the former. Also, an increase in the number of amine groups present at the membrane surface as a result of an increase in the concentration of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the membrane has been shown to lead to the wrinkling of some polymer chains and, hence, larger surface roughness (Vatanpour et al., 2014). In addition, the surface roughness of the 1 wt% SiO2/PSF membrane is observed to be much larger than that of the 1 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes (Table 2). This observation is due to the fact that nanoparticle agglomeration is more pronounced for the former than the latter (Fig. 2S(f) versus Fig. 2S(d)).

Various approaches have been employed to improve the hydrophilicity of PSF membrane surface, which mainly includes surface grafting [9,10], surface coating [11,12], and surface segregation [13]. Surface grafting and coating are usually carried out in the post-modification process, and surface segregation is generally achieved in the membrane formation with amphiphilic materials. Specifically, hydrophilic segments of the amphiphilic copolymers segregate to the membrane surface and pore wall in the phase inversion due to their low interfacial energy with the coagulation bath of water, and hydrophobic segments are firmly anchored within the membrane",n,0.9999984

203,203,"To investigate the formation mechanism for different microstructures, four PSF/SMA/DMAC dope solutions were prepared, and a phase diagram was established by evaluating the thermodynamic stability of dope solutions with different SMA at 70 degC (Fig. 4c). For the SMA with more opened anhydride groups, the cloud point could be observed only when more water was added. This implies that the transformation degree of SMA (anh) into SMA affected the rate of non-solvent and solvent exchange. Specifically, the more anhydride groups of SMA were opened, the slower the phase separation rate of dope solutions was, and thus uniform, small pores were created on the membrane surface and the skin layer thickness increased. Additionally, an interesting observation was that alkaline environment can increase the solubility of low-molecular-weight SMA (anh) copolymers (Mw ~ 2000 Da) in water (Fig.S1c). However, high-molecular-weight SMA (anh) copolymers were only swollen in the same alkaline environment instead of being dissolved. This demonstrates the transformation degree of macromolecular SMA (anh) into SMA could increase its hydration but didn't lead to its dissolution in the coagulation bath of water in this study. Therefore, SMA should not leave the membrane during the phase inversion. To further confirm the existence of SMA in the membranes, the chemical groups of the membrane surface were characterized by FTIR spectra (Fig.S1d). For PSF/SMA membranes, the peak at 1779 cm-1 was little by little weakened with the extending the open-ring reaction time compared with PSF/SMA (anh) membranes, suggesting more anhydride rings were opened [28,29]. The peak at 1665 cm-1 broadened, indicating more SMA molecules were formed and anchored on the membranes.

204,204,"To further optimize the membrane microstructures, 4 wt% polyethylene glycols (PEG) and 4 wt% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) with different molecular weights were used as the second additives in the fabrication of PSF/SMA-4 h-1 wt% membranes. There are several reasons for using SMA and PEG or PVP as dual additives. First, water soluble PEG and PVP have been frequently used in the membrane fabrication as effective additives to adjust the membrane structure and improve the membrane performance [30-32]. Second, there may be a synergistic effect of SMA and PEG or PVP on the membrane structure due to the intermolecular interaction such as hydrogen bonding [22,33]. As presented in Fig. 5, PEG didn't obviously affect the cross-sectional membrane structure, and numerous finger-like pores remained, similar to the membranes without additives. However, the membrane surface pores were reduced when the molecular weight of PEG was < 2000 Da, which may be related to the kinetics and thermodynamics in the membrane formation [24]. Theoretically, the addition of PEG increased the thermodynamic instability of the dope solutions, accelerating the instantaneous demixing in the phase separation [30]. However, the viscosity of dope solutions was largely elevated due to the PEG-SMA hydrogen bonding (Fig.S2), which reduced the non-solvent and solvent rate of exchange and delayed the phase demixing, suppressing the large pore formation. Interestingly, the surface pores were evidently enlarged when the molecular weight of PEG was 10000 Da. This phenomenon may be due to that the PEG10000 interacted with SMA not only via the hydrogen bonding but also strong molecular chain entanglement, and then they were simultaneously enriched on the membrane surface and pore walls by the segregation during the phase inversion. As a result, the relatively large pores were formed on the membrane surface owing to their strong hydration. Comparatively, the membrane surface structure was hardly impacted by PVP, but the cross-sectional morphology was drastically changed with increasing the molecular weight. Many short finger-like pores and macrovoids were observed. This may be due to that there was no interaction between PVP and SMA like the PEG-SMA hydrogen bonding, and thus they couldn't synergistically manipulate the membrane structure during the phase separation process. Compared with PVP-K30 (Mw ~ 37900 Da), the high viscosity of dope solutions containing PVP-K60 (Mw ~ 216000 Da) or PVP-K90 (Mw ~ 630000 Da) delayed the phase separation, leading to the disappearance of long finger-like pores and the formation of more short finger-like pores or macrovoids. Correspondingly, the connectivity between the bottom and top membrane surfaces was significantly weakened. Furthermore, it is also observed that the mean pore size of membranes increased from 0.033 um to 0.045 um with increasing the molecular weight of PEG, but initially increased to 0.63 um and then largely decreased to 0.026 um with increasing the molecular weight of PVP.

Compared with the PSF/SMA (anh) membrane, the WCA of PSF/SMA membranes gradually decreased from 86.3deg to 77.2deg, and then slightly increased to 80.6deg with further increasing the open-ring reaction time (Fig. 6a). Additionally, the WCA of the membrane obviously decreased as the additional amount of SMA was raised (Fig. 6b). On one hand, this indicates the segregation for SMA onto the membrane surface was enhanced due to its uniform dispersion in the dope solution, which originated from the elevated interaction with PSF. On the other hand, the WCA was affected by the surface structure as reported in the literature [34]. Notably, when the molecular weight of PEG was < 2000 Da, the WCA of the surface was almost the same with that of the membrane without additives (Fig. 6c), which might be due to that those small molecules were dissolved in the water and were removed during the latter immersion in deionized water [32,35]. However, when the molecular weight of PEG increased to 10000 Da, the WCA of the surface was greatly reduced to 69.1deg suggesting optimal hydrophilicity, which further confirmed the aforementioned accumulation of PEG10000 on the membrane surface via the hydrogen bonding and molecular chain entanglement. The molecular weight of PVP was much higher than that of PEG, but it did not decrease the WCA of the membrane surface (Fig. 6d). From Fig.S2, the lower viscosity of PSF/SMA/PVP dope solutions suggested no strong hydrogen bonding between SMA and PVP, compared with PSF/SMA/PEG [36,37].

206,206,"The surface hydrophilicity theoretically enhances the permeation and antifouling properties of the membrane [38,39]. Fig. 7 shows the BSA rejection and permeation of the as-prepared membranes. As displayed in Fig. 7a, b, c, d-2, the rejection wasn't obviously varied by the conversion of SMA (anh) into SMA, controlling the additional amount of SMA, and selecting PEG and PVP as the second additives. All the membranes exhibited an excellent BSA separation (>96 %). Nevertheless, compared with the PSF/SMA (anh) membrane, the pure water flux of PSF/SMA membranes was remarkably elevated from 50.62 L/m2*h*bar to 386.75 L/m2*h*bar when the open-ring reaction time was 4 h, then decreased to 262.93 L/m2*h*bar with further increasing the open-ring reaction time to 8 h (Fig. 7a-1), and reduced to 146.75 L/m2*h*bar with growing the content of SMA-4 h to 4 wt% (Fig. 7b-1). This doesn't completely agree with the above results of WCA, and thus the effects of membrane structure and pore size should be taken into account. Though the PSF/SMA (anh) membrane possessed the largest mean pore size, spherical particles on the surface and cross-section inevitably blocked lots of pores leading to the filtration resistance increase. In contrast, uniform pores were constructed on the PSF/SMA membrane accompanying the disappearance of spherical particles, which was conducive to the permeate flux enhancement. However, a very dense skin layer was formed and the pore size was reduced due to the increase of SMA and the further prolongation of open-ring reaction time. From Fig. 7c-1and d-1, the pure water flux of the membrane was highly enhanced with growing the molecular weight of PEG, but it only slightly increased from 386.75 L/m2*h*bar to 403.56 L/m2*h*bar compared with the membranes without the second additives. Moreover, it was further increased to 415.8 L/m2*h*bar by tuning the additional amount of PEG10000, but sharply reduced with increasing the molecular weight of PVP.

207,207,"An interfacial hydration layer could be easily formed on the membrane surface to elevate the antifouling properties due to the improvement of hydrophilicity [40,41]. Therefore, pure water and BSA solution alternately filtered through the membrane as the feed, and then the circle was repeated three times to evaluate the antifouling properties. The time-dependent permeate fluxes during every circle process were presented in Fig.S3. The FRR is calculated and presented in Fig. 8. All PSF/SMA membranes displayed an obvious increase in FRR in contrast to the PSF/SMA (anh) membrane. Along with extending the open-ring reaction time, FRR quickly increased from 68.8% to 86.2% and then almost stayed stable (Fig. 8a). Subsequently, it was further elevated to 88.3 % by growing the additional amount of SMA-4 h to 4 wt% (Fig. 8b). Excitingly, the FRR was significantly enhanced to 91.25 % by adding PEG10000 and 95.15 % by increasing the additional amount of PEG10000 to 8 wt% (Fig. 8c) though it didn't obviously improve the permeate flux. However, the addition of PVP hardly raised the FRR (Fig. 8d). Besides the aforementioned hydrophilicity, the antifouling property of the membrane is also affected by the surface pore structure. Smaller pores were constructed on the membrane surface to form a denser skin layer by growing the open-ring reaction time and SMA. As a result, BSA was mostly adsorbed on the surface and easily washed away in the cleaning process resulting in the increase of FRR. For the membrane containing PEG10000 as the second additive, a great many PEG molecules were deposited on the membrane surface via the hydrogen bonding with SMA and molecular chain entanglement (Fig. 8e). Correspondingly, a more stable interfacial hydration layer could be formed on the membrane surface. Therefore, it exhibited the highest FRR and optimal antifouling properties among all as-prepared membranes. Moreover, it was also observed that the pure water flux, rejection and antifouling properties of PSF/SMA membranes significantly outperformed the reported values for other similar PSF membranes [6-8,42-46] (Table 1). This clearly indicates that the membrane microstructure could be manipulated by controlling the dual role of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer in the membrane fabrication as a pore former and amphiphilic surface modifier to achieve the superior performances. Importantly, this strategy can be utilized to fabricate the membranes on a large scale.",380,"An interfacial hydration layer could be easily formed on the membrane surface to elevate the antifouling properties due to the improvement of hydrophilicity [40,41]. Therefore, pure water and BSA solution alternately filtered through the membrane as the feed, and then the circle was repeated three times to evaluate the antifouling properties. The time-dependent permeate fluxes during every circle process were presented in Fig.S3. The FRR is calculated and presented in Fig. 8. All PSF/SMA membranes displayed an obvious increase in FRR in contrast to the PSF/SMA (anh) membrane. Along with extending the open-ring reaction time, FRR quickly increased from 68.8% to 86.2% and then almost stayed stable (Fig. 8a). Subsequently, it was further elevated to 88.3 % by growing the additional amount of SMA-4 h to 4 wt% (Fig. 8b). Excitingly, the FRR was significantly enhanced to 91.25 % by adding PEG10000 and 95.15 % by increasing the additional amount",n,0.99999905
208,208,"In order to enhance the permeate flux, separation and antifouling performances, SMA (anh) was utilized to adjust the PSF membrane microstructure via the transformation into SMA. It is discovered that SMA acted as a pore former and amphiphilic surface modifier in the fabrication of PSF membrane by the NIPS process. Significantly, the dual role can be simultaneously manipulated by controlling the transformation degree of SMA. As more anhydride rings of SMA were opened, uniform small pores were constructed on the membrane surface, whereas long finger-like pores were formed in the membrane cross-section due to the improved interaction and pore-forming ability for SMA. Moreover, PEG and PVP with different molecular weights were used to further optimize the membrane microstructure as the second additives. Intriguingly, due to the strong hydrogen bonding and chain entanglement with SMA, high-molecular-weight PEG was anchored on the membrane surface together with SMA. Consequently, the as-prepared membranes exhibited the optimal surface hydrophilicity, the highest permeate flux and excellent antifouling properties, and largely outperformed other similar PSF composite membranes.

Hydrophobic surfaces cause protein adhesion due to the following reasons: When protein molecules in solution are adsorbed on hydrophobic materials, the hydrophobic part of the molecular chain will contact with the surface of the material while the hydrophilic part will interact with water molecules. This is thermodynamically favorable since this behavior reduces the free energy of water with the material surface. Meanwhile, experiments showed that proteins could slightly change their conformation by exposing hydrophobic domains that interact strongly with hydrophobic surfaces [6].",205,"The flourish development of membrane-based separation technology is motivated by growing concern over separation, classification, enrichment of multi-component system and water purification, etc. The application of membrane technology on hemodialysis has wide-reaching implications on removing metabolic waste products in patients with severe renal disease.

215,215,"The adsorption of protein on the surface of the material can cause a series of biological reactions, such as platelet adhesion and aggregation, together with the activation of coagulation system, which will form thrombus and thus seriously affect the biocompatibility of the membranes [7]. Various modification strategies including surface modification [8], blending [3,9-11] and bulk modification [2] have been utilized to improve the biocompatibility of PSF membranes. However, the current modification methods exist various disadvantages. The approach for membrane surface modification includes plasma induction [12], coating [13-16] and surface grafting [17,18], etc. To improve the blood compatibility of PSF membrane, Zhao et al.[19] grafted two sulfonic acid-containing zwitterionic copolymers on PSF membranes that exhibited good anticoagulant performance due to the hydrophilic surface. Mao et al. [20] grafted polyethylene glycol and heparin onto PSF via plasma-induced surface modification to prepare PSF-PEG-Hep membranes. The results showed the hemocompatibility of PSF improved by grafting PEG and Hep. However, the current surface modification technologies are unable to satisfy the expectations due to the insufficient coating stability, complicated processes, difficult-to-industrial and uncontrollable pore size distribution after grafting [21]. Compared with surface modification, blending methods received considerable attention due to its facile chemical steps, which could be performed by simply adding the modifiers into the casting solution [11,22-24]. The modifiers would be induced to the membrane surface during phase inversion process to improve the hydrophilicity of the membranes [25-29]. Li et al. [11] blended hydrophilic poly (ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVOH) with PSF in the presence of PEG (20 kDa) and optimized by adjusting the PEG content to prepare an ultrafiltration membrane with high porosity and antifouling properties and the penetration rate of PSF membranes reached 316 L*m-2*h-1*bar-1(1 bar = 0.1 MPa). However, blending methods often meet the limitation of the additive loss. The main reason is that the shear force between the circulating fluid and the blood during use will lead to the flushing of the additive, and the sterilization method will lead to the elution of the additive [30]. Besides, the low miscibility between the additives and the membrane matrix will also result in insufficient modification effect [31]. Therefore, it is critical to develop a simple and efficient hydrophilic modification method.",365,"The adsorption of protein on the surface of the material can cause a series of biological reactions, such as platelet adhesion and aggregation, together with the activation of coagulation system, which will form thrombus and thus seriously affect the biocompatibility of the membranes [7].

283,283,"The direct deposition of a coating layer on a membrane targets the enhancement of the membrane surface without interfering with the integrity of the bulk membrane. This, therefore, provides flexibility for a wide range of possibilities on the types of organic materials [8] and inorganic materials [9] that could be utilized to design the layers. Findings show that the exposure of coated materials on the surface of the membranes can improve the performance as well as impart new features, contrary to the blended materials approach, where these desired features may be overpowered by the properties of the bulk polymers [10]. Combining both organic and inorganic materials to generate a hybrid functional layer is an efficient technique in surface coating. The merits of this combination are that the organic component acts as a binder and pore-size modifier while the inorganic component enhances hydrophilicity and imparts stabilization of the organic component. Tian et al. [11] fabricated a composite functional layer from poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) substrate for the separation of surfactant stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. The average pore size of CNTs-PAN membrane was reduced to 250 nm from 900 nm of the PAN membrane. This improved the selectivity of the coated membrane to 93 % removal of oil droplets compared to ~50 % of an oil-in-water emulsion containing droplet sizes <2 mm. Furthermore, the formation of the superhydrophilic hybrid coating from PVA and CNTs exhibited self-cleaning properties after filtration of the emulsions. Elsewhere, Gao et al. [12] generated hybrid films consisting of a double organic and an inorganic element from, polydopamine, PEI and single-walled carbon nanotubes for oil-in-water separation. The pore-sizes of the hybrid coating ranged between 5 and 14 nm, which was effective in the separation of oil-in water emulsions containing an average of 54 nm droplet size while maintaining nearly 100 % flux recovery at different oil concentrations of oil content in the emulsions. Most recently, Yang et al. [13] also established the benefits of combining organic and inorganic materials for oily wastewater treatment. In their research, two organic components (carboxymethyl chitosan and tannic acid) were combined with inorganic Cu3(PO4)2 on polyvinylidene fluoride via alternate quaternary soaking. In the absence of the inorganic component (Cu3(PO4)2) on the coating, the generated membrane displayed poor permeability and antifouling performance while that containing Cu3(PO4)2 had up to 127 % improvement in permeation at high oil removal rates (99.6 %) and excellent antifouling properties. In these studies, the combination of materials is similar i.e. organic and inorganic but the properties of the hybrid layers are tunable to achieve the desired selectivity and antifouling characteristics suited to the separation of varying oil-in-water separation owing to the synergistic effect mechanism of organic and inorganic components.

Among them, PEI as a versatile water-soluble polymer is used as an organic coating during membrane fabrication. Its wide applicability stems from the fact that it is rich in amino groups that endow it with a strong positive charge [18]. TiO2 NPs were chosen as the inorganic component in the coating because of their antifouling, antibacterial, chemical and thermal enhancing properties. To begin with, the crosslinking reaction between PEI and GA was established to identify the optimum working concentrations. Afterward, PEI was then integrated with various concentrations of TiO2 NPs and after vacuum-assisted deposition, was then crosslinked with GA. Unlike in the use of TMC, crosslinking with GA offers a greener reaction approach with aldimine condensation reactions between aldehyde and amine groups yielding water molecules while those with TMC yield hydrochloric acid that may require additional removal steps [18]. The target is to utilize the interplay between TiO2 NPs, PEI and GA to generate a new model of hybrid coating with the potential to meet the current application needs. The relationship of these three materials is interpreted as follows: TiO2 NPs were stably bound to PEI through hydrogen bonding with the NH2 groups. Then NH2 groups from PEI undergo aldimine condensation with aldehyde groups from GA. Additionally, -OH groups from adsorbed water on the TiO2 NPs also reacted with the carbonyl center of GA further ensuring the stability of the coated layer on the membrane surface.

The amine groups from PEI then add to the unsaturated groups by attacking the carbonyl centers and follow through to another condensation reaction (aldimine condensation) generating CN unsaturated bonds, as illustrated in Fig. 3[18,29]. Assessment of functional groups from FT-IR was utilized to elaborate and confirm the formation of the surface coating (Fig. S3).

The formation of CN bonds is represented by a brief and sharp band at 1659 cm-1. -NH2 groups from PEI correlate with the band at 1576 cm-1. Crosslinking PEI with sufficient quantity of GA, increases the intensity of the band at 1659 cm-1 while that at 1576 cm-1 decreases i.e. as the amine groups are consumed in the aldmine condensation process, more unsaturated CN bonds are formed (represented by M1 spectrum in Fig. S3). From this analogy it is inferred that a small ratio of NH2:C=N absorbance peaks will be representative of a high crosslinking degree as listed in Table S2[23]. The ratio of reactants in M1 is 1:2 PEI:GA. An insufficient or excess quantity of GA is characterized by the appearance of a bend at 1717 cm-1 representative of unreacted -C=O groups, as displayed in Fig. S3 (b). Furthermore, to supplement the crosslinking degree analysis, the rigidity of the PEI/GA@MMMs is further described using the water sorption capacity, as presented in Table S2.

316,316,"Fig. 8 shows TGA curves of the UF MMM and composite membranes. All the membranes show four decomposition phases, which can be associated with the chemical content of the membranes and the chemical interactions occurring in the membranes. In the first phase at 100-200 degC, all the composite membranes (PEI-TiO2/GA 0-0.1 wt% coating layers) show a higher mass loss and decomposition rate than the substrate M0 [38] . This initial phase is related to the loss of water and any residual solvent. This is because these membranes coated by PEI adsorb more surface water than the substrate. Clearly, the effect gradually decreases as the temperature is elevated with increasing saturation of inorganic TiO2 NPs content in the composite membrane. In the second phase at around 200-450 degC, the decomposition is attributed to the pyrolysis of more thermally stable groups such as -SO3- belonging to SPSf in M0 [19]. Additionally, the composite membranes with a PEI-TiO2/GA hybrid layer exhibit a slower rate of decomposition at this temperature region as a result of chemical crosslinks and hydrogen bond interactions with PEI. From this, it is evident that the composite membranes display improved thermal stability in comparison with the UF MMM substrate [34]. In the third phase from 480 to 600 degC, the major mass loss observed is associated with the decomposition of the polymer backbones. Beyond 600 degC, there is an obvious distinction between the composite membranes and the UF MMMs. In particular, M6 shows a maximum resistance to thermal degradation at this stage. This is ascribed to the high TiO2 NPs content that absorbs more heat and has high thermal resistance. Furthermore, for the composite membranes, a slight mass loss at around 700 degC marks the degradation of oxygen-stable groups remaining in the polymer backbone. Any substance residue after 800 degC is inorganic residue [33]. The weight of the residue correlates with the expected content of TiO2 NPs in the composite membranes.

To further support the robust antifouling ability, the air/WCA was measured after the composite membranes underwent PWP in phase V. The contact angle of the M0 (58deg) after filtration and cleaning with gasoline oil-in-water increased to 104deg and 98deg,",n,0.9999999
329,329,"PEI-TiO2/GA thin hybrid layers were fabricated on PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs to generate PEI-TiO2/GA@MMMs composite membranes, suitable for efficient separation of various oil-in-water emulsions containing nano-sized oil droplets in the range of 100-300 nm. The effect of TiO2 NPs loadings on the thickness, surface wettability, surface charge and MWCO of the hybrid layer was assessed. Using functional groups analysis, the mechanism of layer formation was proven to be the result of aldimine condensation between carbonyl centers of GA and amine groups of PEI as well hydrogen-bonding interactions. The end-end chain stacking of PEI-GA groups in M1 (PEI/GA@MMM, i.e., without TiO2) was found to cause the formation of a dense surface coating with poor permeability and antifouling performance but had high selectivity ascribed to the reduced pore sizes. In contrast, the PEI-TiO2/GA hybrid coatings had loosely packed chains, which facilitated improved transport and reinforced antifouling properties owing to the presence of TiO2 NPs. It was observed that at very high TiO2 NPs loadings (>0.05 wt% TiO2) the hybrid layers became too loosely packed, leading to reduced oil retention and increased permeability. Optimal PEI-TiO2/GA@MMM composite membrane M3 (PEI-TiO2 (0.025)/GA@MMM), displayed improved thermal, permeance, retention and antifouling characteristics. The permeance of M3 was 62 LMH bar-1, which was 29 % higher than M1 (44 LMH bar-1). M3 was also able to reject >90 % of various oil-in-water emulsions containing nano-sized droplets at the range of ~100-300 nm. Furthermore, M3 also demonstrated enhanced underwater oleophobicity against gasoline, hexane, DCM and PE and a low WCA, which enabled the composite membrane to exhibit ideal antifouling performance in comparison to M1. Conclusively, PEI-TiO2/GA hybrid coatings were established to be suitable for the effective separation of oil-in-water nanoemulsions owing the mutually beneficial relationship between the organic and inorganic components.",290,"PEI-TiO2/GA thin hybrid layers were fabricated on PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs to generate PEI-TiO2/GA@MMMs composite membranes, suitable for efficient separation of various oil-in-water emulsions containing nano-sized oil droplets in the range of 100-300 nm.

336,336,"UF membranes are usually synthesized from poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethersulfone (PES), and polysulfone (PSF). These are mostly hydrophobic, chemically resistant, and thermally and mechanically stable polymers [78]. Nonetheless, hydrophilic membranes have gained more popularity in the water treatment industry than hydrophobic membranes as they achieve higher water permeate flux and higher solute rejection. However, efforts have been made to improve hydrophobic polymeric membranes by blending the polymers with hydrophilic polymers to produce fouling-controlling membranes without affecting water permeance and solute rejection[8]. Thus, blended membranes were synthesized with water-insoluble amphiphilic hydrophilic copolymers. For example, Xie et al.

Similarly, Bagheripour et al.

Our previous study reported the preparation of PES/SPSF blended membranes, which also showed high permeability and improved antifouling properties[9]. Although it is established that membrane properties (surface hydrophilicity, water permeance, antifouling) improve significantly upon blending hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers, very few polymer materials can be mixed because they are not identical in interaction and are deemed incompatible [10].

368,368,"Usually, one of the interactions present in many miscible polymer blends is hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds may occur within the same polymer through intramolecular bonding or between adjacent polymers [23]. The MD simulations were applied to gain insight into the improvement of the polymer miscibility in the blend PSF/EVOH32 upon the inclusion of a third polymer, PEG, with functional groups capable of forming additional hydrogen interactions with both PSF and EVOH32 [29]. Radial distribution function (RDF) is an important approach generally used to estimate the strength of intramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding in the structural investigations of solid packing (local structure). It provides the probability of atoms at a distance, r, from another atom [24]. The RDF was plotted for the PSF-EVOH32-PEG and PSF-EVOH32 networks, as shown in Fig. 2 and S3. Hydrogen bonding was identified as a distance of about 2.6-3.3 Angstroms (A) between the donor and acceptor atoms [25]. The results revealed that upon adding another good proton-accepting polymer, that being PEG, in the PSF/EVOH32 binary system, the hydrogen-bond interactions became strong between the polar groups. One indication of that is the appearance of a prominent peak around g(r) = 2.69 A for the PSF-EVOH32-PEG blend, as shown in Fig. 2(c). This peak corresponds to a strong hydrogen interaction between these polymers, indicating the presence of a correlation between atoms within that radius [26]. In Fig. 2(b), the peak for PSF/EVOH32 is instead located around 3.29 A, suggesting a longer-range distance resulting in weaker hydrogen bonding in that system compared to PEG. Furthermore, g(r) the individual blends PSF/PEG (Fig. S3(b)) and EVOH32/PEG (Fig. S3(c)) were both greater than 3.5 A. This may be due to the oxygen atoms in PEG improving the interaction between the different components, as observed in Fig. 2(a) andFig. S3(a)[10].

Interestingly, the blend membrane (M2-12) obtained from a very high PEG content (12 wt%) in the casting solution exhibited a complete sponge-like structure Fig. 7(d).

The results demonstrated that the presence of PEG significantly improved the miscibility of the polymers. A large quantity of hydrophilic functional groups present on the surface of the membrane was attributed to the hydroxyl group's segregation from EVOH. The hydrophilicity resulted in enhanced pure water permeance as well as antifouling properties. The BSA rejection of the blend membranes increased as the polymer mass ratio increased from PSF/EVOH (100/0 wt%) to PSF/EVOH",n,0.99781907

To improve the flux of the TUF membrane, PSf was employed and modified by blocking with polyethylene glycol or sulfonation, and used for the preparation of TUF membranes by NIPS technique [19,20].

So, the CR/Na2SO4 selectivity increases from 3.6 to 42.6 with Na2SO4 concentration. The higher rejection to Na2SO4 can be explained by the larger hydrated ionic radii and higher negative charges of sulfate [48]. The flux decay with increased salt concentration is due to the high osmotic pressure reduced the effective transmembrane pressure [47]. Due to the higher rejection for Na2SO4, the effective transmembrane pressure becomes lower than that of CR/NaCl mixed solution, which resulted in lower flux. The increase of dye/salt selectivity can be attributed to the higher salt concentration enhancing the electrostatic shielding effect and finally reducing the salts rejection efficiency [49].",255,"The purpose of the study is to fabricate high TUF for the removal of dyes from saline textile wastewater, thus, M2 was utilized for the separation of artificial saline textile wastewater.

PRW contains numerous types of hazardous contaminants with high concentrations, such as heavy metals (Pb, Hg, Cr), oil content (100 - 400 mg/L), inorganic ions (Cl-, SO42-, PO43-), phenolic substances (100 - 1200 mg/L), dissolved ammonia (50 - 900 mg/L), dissolved organic matter (500 - 1000 mg/L), total dissolved solids (TDS) (1000 - 5000 mg/L), mostly appeared in basic condition (pH = 8.0-8.8), and high electrical conductivity content (2000 - 7000 uS/cm) [3-7].

442,442,"Semiconductor oxides have been widely utilized as photocatalysts, such as SnO2, ZnO, Fe3O4, Ag3PO4, WO3, TiO2, CeO2, Bi2WO6, and graphene oxide [17,18,20-28]. They have been applied for degrading pollutants, including dyes, organic pollutants, natural organic matters, and pharmaceutical substances. Among them, TiO2 has attracted extensive attention from scientists and engineers because of its chemical stability, ease to activate, low toxicity, modifiable, and water-insoluble, showing promising application for wastewater treatment [17]. Unluckily, the large bandgap energy, high probability of electron/hole recombination, and low sensitivity are limiting its application on a large scale [29]. The efficiency of TiO2 photocatalyst strongly depends on the photo-induced electron/hole recombination rate because photo-degradation cannot work if the generated electrons and holes are recombined [30]. Hence, the recombination rate should be prevented as much as possible to achieve better photocatalytic performance. In order to overcome this problem and increase the photo-sensitivity of TiO2 photocatalyst, electronic structure modification of the photocatalyst is needed. One of the most common methods for this is by grafting the transition metal ions to TiO2[30]. As one of the best candidates for metal transition, cobalt was chosen for this purpose, supported by the fact that cobalt (Co2+/Co3+) and titanium (Ti4+) ions have a similar size of cation; therefore, the substitution of titanium ions by cobalt ions is reasonably possible. It is reported that the doping of Co into TiO2 showed outstanding improvements in photocatalytic degradations of methyl orange, carbamazepine, and azo dye in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light irradiations [31,32]. In some studies, they observed that bandgap energy decreased in Co-doped TiO2 composite from 3.11 eV (unmodified TiO2) to 2.94 eV (Co-TiO2) [30,32].

443,443,"Furthermore, efficient photocatalysts should have a large surface area to provide massive active sites for photocatalysis. SiO2 has been widely utilized as catalyst support for TiO2[33,34]. The incorporation of SiO2 influences some fundamental characteristics of TiO2 and improves its photocatalytic properties [33,34]. Balachandran and coworkers reported that the specific surface area improved from 65 m2/g for TiO2 to 75 m2/g for TiO2/SiO2 composite [35]. Next, Wei and coworkers reported that SiO2 doping improved the surface acidity of the TiO2/SiO2 composite. They stated that pristine TiO2 has only the Lewis acid sites, while TiO2/SiO2 composite has both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites that are caused by the charge imbalance as the effect of different coordination numbers of Si and Ti metal center [36]. To balance this condition, a huge number of protons must be extracted (usually from H2O) and produce hydroxyls (OH-), which improves the surface acidity [37]. The generated hydroxyl from enhanced surface acidity can act as hole scavengers boosting the oxidation process of H2O into hydroxyl radicals [36,37]. This process enhances the charge separation and prevents electron-hole recombination, leading to photocatalytic improvements. Moreover, the addition of SiO2 into TiO2 improved the thermal stability of the TiO2/SiO2 composite, thus, inhibiting the TiO2's crystalline conversion from the anatase into the rutile phase [38]. Utilizing SiO2 as catalyst support also provides pollutant adsorption that brings the pollutant molecules closer to the active sites of the catalyst, thus resulting in a higher rate of photodegradation [39].

All pHPZC values were in the range of 3.32-5.62, which means they have a similar surface charge from the similar surface acidity. When the pHPZC is lower than 7, that means the sample has an acidic surface [43]. The acidic surface tends to have a net negative charge on the surface. On the other hand, when the pHPZC is higher than 7, that means the sample has a basic surface that tends to have a net positively charged surface. It can be stated that all samples have the same negatively charged surface. It signifies that these nanoparticles attributed the fabricated nanohybrid membranes to the negatively charged surface. Consequently, the basic pH condition of PRW, which was 8.53 +- 0.65, is higher than the pHPZC of whether SiO2, TiO2, Co-SiO2, TiO2 @SiO2, or Co-TiO2 @SiO2, so the membrane surface can develop strong repulsion forces against the negatively charged pollutants. These mechanisms can be advantageous for the pollutant rejection performance of the fabricated membranes. Additionally, from the photocatalytic aspects, the photoinduced holes from the photocatalysts' heterojunction process have a strong tendency to react with the water molecules on the negatively charged membrane's surface that can produce large amounts of hydroxyl radicals that are so much helpful for pollutant degradations [53].

472,472,"The results regarding pore properties of the membranes in terms of thickness, porosity, and average pore size are summarized in Table 6. Based on the results, the membrane thickness increased as the photocatalysts were added. M-01 (neat PSf) has a thickness of 32.30 +- 0.44 um and became the thinnest membrane among the others. After the addition of the photocatalyst, the membrane layer became thicker with a relatively similar increment. For example, after the addition of Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst in M-06, the membrane thickness increased from 32.30 +- 0.44 um to 43.80 +- 0.32 um. This can be due to the swelling effect in the polymer structure after the addition of photocatalyst particles which resulted in a thicker membrane layer. In contrast, the porosity parameter showed different trends. M-01 has a porosity value of 53.70 +- 0.28%, attributed to the least porous membrane among the others. The incorporation of photocatalyst resulted in a significant increment of porosity. As an example, M-06 that incorporated by Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst has the highest porosity among the other membranes with a value of 68.91 +- 0.66%. This indicates that the incorporation of photocatalyst into the membrane creates more void sites in the membrane's body, as in agreement with the cross-section morphology images from SEM results. M-06 exhibited a better arrangement of finger-like structure that can accommodate more voids which increases the membrane's porosity. Membrane with high porosity can provide a good water uptake ability that can improve the permeate flux performance [44]. Furthermore, the average pore radii of the fabricated membrane were also measured. It is found that the photocatalyst addition to the membrane slightly reduced the pore size of the membranes. M-01 has a pore size of 42.54 +- 1.33 nm, while M-06 with the embedded Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst has a smaller pore size with a value of 28.76 +- 1.12 nm. This phenomenon can also be seen in cross-section images that M-01 has some large unselective voids, which caused a larger pore size in measurement. M-06 attributed the well-constructed pore structure that produces smaller pores. Membranes with smaller pore sizes can achieve better pollutant removal efficiency by filtration, and the permeate flux quality can meet the desired quality specification. It is also noteworthy that according to the pore size, all membranes can be classified into the ultrafiltration (UF) membrane since their average pore sizes still fall in the range of 10 - 100 nm [59].",403,"The results regarding pore properties of the membranes in terms of thickness, porosity, and average pore size are summarized in Table 6.

Profiles of pollutants' concentration changing (Ct/Co) for the fabricated membranes are presented in Fig. 11. From Fig. 11, it can be seen before the UV lamp was turned on, there is a slight removal occurred, which corresponds to the adsorption of pollutants. Membranes with embedded photocatalysts show considerably higher pollutant adsorption than the neat PSf. This adsorption effect can be due to the negatively charged surface properties of the membranes after being added by the photocatalysts, as shown in PZC results. The active photocatalyst sites on the negatively charged surface provide attraction forces to positively charged pollutants, which promotes the adsorption effect of the membrane's surface [43,75]. Furthermore, after the UV light was turned on, the pollutants' concentration significantly changed. Photocatalysis plays a dominant role in this stage.

Profiles of pollutants' concentration changing (Ct/Co) for the fabricated membranes are presented in Fig. 11. From Fig. 11, it can be seen before the UV lamp was turned on, there is a slight removal occurred, which corresponds to the adsorption of pollutants. Membranes with embedded photocatalysts show considerably higher pollutant adsorption than the neat PSf. This adsorption effect can be due to the negatively charged surface properties of the membranes after being added by the photocatalysts, as shown in PZC results. The active photocatalyst sites on the negatively charged surface provide attraction forces to positively charged pollutants, which promotes the adsorption effect of the membrane's surface [43,75]. Furthermore, after the UV light was turned on, the pollutants' concentration significantly changed. Photocatalysis plays a dominant role in this",n,0.9999967

It is also found that all active species play essential roles in pollutant degradation; eliminating one of them resulted in the reduction of degradation efficiency. Hydroxyl radicals dominate the photodegradation ability of the membranes, which signifies that hydroxyl radical is the highest generated active species. This can be due to the strong acidic Ti-O-Si bonds in the TiO2 @SiO2 and Co-TiO2 @SiO2 composite, which produces a charge imbalance because of the different numbers of coordination of the Si and Ti metals. As a result, a great amount of protons is taken from water (H2O) molecules that generate OH- ions and subsequently turned into the hydroxyl radicals [36,37].

In general, Co-TiO2 plays a key role in the photocatalysis reaction, while SiO2 provides the adsorption of pollutant molecules to be closer to the photocatalyst, resulting in easier and faster degradation of pollutants. When the composite is irradiated with photon energy from UV light which should be equal to or higher than 3.10 eV, the electrons (e-) excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). In the CB, the photo-induced electrons gathered, while in the VB, the empty sites filled with the photo-induced holes (h+). In the CB, some electrons reacted with oxygen (O2) through a reduction reaction to form the superoxide radicals (0O2-). Due to the excellent electron conductivity of Co, some electrons from CB traveled to Co and reacted with Co3+ ions to form Co2+. Then, the Co2+ ion can react with O2 to form Co3+ and 0O2-. In addition, the interface and electronic interactions between TiO2 and SiO2 is also helpful through the Ti-O-Si bonds that significantly increase the surface reactivity to produce the radical molecules. This property can reduce the rate of electron-hole recombination [39]. In the VB, the photo-induced holes reacted with water (H2O) or hydroxyl (OH-) molecules through an oxidation reaction to produce the hydroxyl radicals (0OH). As both generated radicals have strong reactivity, 0O2- and 0OH radicals reacted with pollutants to degrade them and resulting in CO2, H2O, and mineral acids as the products.

In this result, the membrane was performed under a dynamic condition of UV light exposure, as can be seen in the figure.

According to the results, it can be seen that the addition of photocatalysts into the membranes resulted in the reduction of fouling ratios and increment of FRR. Further, performing the membrane filtration under UV light irradiation exhibited a significant reduction in fouling ratios. In the dark condition, the irreversible fouling ratio is found to be always more significant than the reversible fouling ratio, but in the UV light condition, the phenomena are reversed. It seems the irreversible foulants were converted to reversible foulants, meaning that the domination of irreversible fouling can be effectively mitigated under UV light exposure for the photocatalytic membranes by the photodegradation of pollutants [63,77]. The irreversible fouling as the effect of pore-blocking by the pollutants can be cleaned by using chemical treatment, while the reversible fouling that usually appears in the form of adsorbed pollutants on the membrane's surface can be cleaned just by backflushing treatment [78]. The reduction of the irreversible fouling ratio signifies that the addition of photocatalysts into the membranes and UV light irradiation during the filtration process resulted in enhanced antifouling properties of the membranes.

503,503,"Polymer blend is a facile method to adjust membrane structure, property and performance due to its convenient operation and mild conditions. The structure and properties of blend membranes were closely related to the compatibility between polymers. Poor compatibility between blend polymers is likely to lead to some negative influence on the membrane structure and properties such as irregular membrane surface and big holes [17]. The strong intermolecular interactions between blend polymers would help to enhance their compatibility such as hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction. The construction of acid-base crosslinking structure by blending basic group-containing polymer into sulfonated polymer is an effective method to restrict water-induced swelling of sulfonated polymer membrane and improve the mechanical property of membrane via the enhanced intermolecular ionic interactions and compatibility for ion exchange membranes [19-21] and pervaporation membranes [22]. Chung and coworkers extended this approach to the fabrication of sulfonated polyphenylenesulfone (SPPSU)-based UF membranes by blending basic polyethyleneimine to enhance the membrane separation and mechanical properties [23]. They found that the effects of the intermolecular ionic interactions were greatly influenced by the polyethyleneimine amount, which consequently changed the phase inversion mechanism and polymer precipitation rate during membrane formation as well as membrane morphology. Different types of basic polymers containing primary amine [23], tertiary amine [19] and imidazole [24] or polybenzimidazole [25] have been chosen to construct acid-base pairs with sulfonated polymers. Another kind of tertiary amine-containing polymer with intrinsic microporosity, Troger's base (TB) polymer has been employed to prepare UF membrane with high porosity and permeability owing to its high backbone rigidity and ineffective chain packing during the phase inversion process [26].",267,"Polymer blend is a facile method to adjust membrane structure, property and performance due to its convenient operation and mild conditions.

527,527,"The structural differences between the SPSf membranes with different TB polymer contents can be explained by the material properties and a two-step formation mechanism of asymmetric membranes. The dense top layer formed firstly when the liquid film was immersed in water. During the NIPS process, the hydrophilic SPSf liquid film required more water for phase separation, which slowed the solidification rate and formed a thick top layer [17]. At the same time, the plasticizing effect of water caused the formation of small surface pores and a low surface porosity. The low surface porosity slowed solvent-nonsolvent convective diffusion, which leads to the formation of narrow and twisted finger-likes pores in the sublayer. The addition of hydrophobic TB polymer increased the hydrophobicity of the polymer and thus increased the chemical potential difference between the casting solution and coagulant bath (water). The coagulant tolerance of the casting solution was reduced according to the cloud point data as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1. The water concentration of cloud point for casting solution was gradually reduced from 16.7 wt% of SPSf membrane to 9.1 wt% of SPSf/TB-15 membrane. Therefore, Liquid-liquid phase separation and solidification in the top layer occurred at lower water concentrations, which decreased the thickness of the top layer. In addition, acid-base crosslinking between SPSf and TB polymer consumed some sulfonic acid groups, which might also promote liquid-liquid phase separation and solidification [34]. Meanwhile, the higher surface porosity of the SPSf/TB blend membrane facilitated the convective diffusion of solvent (NMP) and nonsolvent (water), which resulted in greater liquid-liquid phase separation and solidification rates and larger vertically-interconnected finger-like pores [33,35,36].

The NIPS method (also referred to as the immersion precipitation or Loeb-Sourirajan method) is by far the most versatile and widely employed to fabricate asymmetric structures in industrial standard flat-sheet and hollow fiber membranes. NIPS is considered advantageous and widely applicable due to simplicity of processing and high performance of the resulting membranes. The NIPS method requires at least three components: polymer to determine membrane properties, solvent to dissolve the polymer, and nonsolvent to control phase inversion phenomena. In a typical NIPS process, a homogeneous dope solution, which contains a polymer, a solvent, and a small portion of nonsolvent, is first prepared. Then, the solution is cast into a thin film or spun into a hollow fiber and subsequently immersed in a nonsolvent bath (e.g., water). Due to chemical affinities with polymer, polar aprotic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and dimethylformamide (DMF) are widely used as doping solution. The nonsolvent should have high affinity toward the solvent but not toward the polymer to induce phase inversion and to remove residual solvent. Upon immersion of the cast film into a nonsolvent bath, the solvent and nonsolvent mix spontaneously, which lowers the free energy of the polymer, leading to solidification (e.g., precipitation or crystallization). By controlling the rates of mutual diffusion and polymer solidification, membrane morphology can be precisely tuned for desired membrane applications. Additives are frequently employed either in the dope solution or nonsolvent bath to control solution thermodynamics and phase inversion kinetics [18,19].

589,589,"The NIPS process of the copolymer did not exhibit any noticeable difference compared to that of the PSf homopolymer. The resulting membranes showed a nontransparent, white-colored appearance and had a thickness of approximately 200um. The cross-sectional structures of PSf-b-PEG membranes prepared from solutions with varied copolymer concentrations were characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1, the membranes showed an asymmetric structure consisting of a dense top layer and a highly porous sublayer featured as finger-like cavities. Such a structure implies that the membranes were formed through the instantaneous demixing mechanism because the casting solutions containing the PSf-b-PEG copolymer and NMP still have high mutual affinity to nonsolvent, water [29]. When we compare the structures of the membranes prepared from different polymer concentrations, it is obvious that the finger-like pores are enlarged with increasing copolymer concentrations. Moreover, higher copolymer concentrations, for example, 16-18%, lead to the development of sponge-like structure on top of finger-like macrovoids and the length of the sponge-like structure is increased with rising copolymer concentrations in the casting solutions. As shown in Fig. 2, the thickness of the sponge-like structure is lower than 300nm for membranes prepared at the copolymer concentration of 14% and 15%, and is increased to ~500nm at the copolymer concentration of 16%, and is further drastically increased to approximately 3um and 10um at the concentration of 17% and 18%, respectively. The enlarging finger-like macrovoids and the thickening sponge-like structures in the sublayers with increasing polymer concentrations have been frequently observed in different polymer/solvent/nonsolvent systems [25], and this is explained by the retarded solvent exchange during NIPS as a result of increased viscosity of the casting solutions with rising polymer concentrations [26,27]. This is more or less like the situation of increasing copolymer dosages in the preparation of PSf/PSf-b-PEG blend membranes in our previous work [16]. For the casting solutions with higher copolymer concentrations, e.g. 17% and 18%, demixing takes place in a somewhat retarded way, also leading to denser spongy structures in the sublayer [28], and higher copolymer concentrations retard the demixing to larger extents, thus leading to thicker spongy structures. Thicker spongy structures reduce the solvent exchange [23] and allow longer duration for the polymer-lean phases to grow and coalesce, thus forming larger finger-like macrovoids [29,30].

The resulting membranes showed a nontransparent, white-colored appearance and had a thickness of approximately 200um. The cross-sectional structures of PSf-b-PEG membranes prepared from solutions with varied copolymer concentrations were characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1, the membranes showed an asymmetric structure consisting of a dense top layer and a highly porous sublayer featured as finger-like cavities. Such a structure implies that the membranes were formed through the instantaneous demixing mechanism because the casting solutions containing the PSf-b-PEG copolymer and NMP still have high mutual affinity to nonsolvent, water [29]. When we compare the structures of the membranes prepared from different polymer concentrations, it is obvious that the finger-like pores are enlarged with increasing copolymer concentrations. Moreover, higher copolymer concentrations, for example, 16-18%, lead to the development of sponge-like structure",n,0.9969921

XPS analyses were used to investigate the surface composition of the membrane prepared from 15% copolymer concentration. Peaks originated from carbon, oxygen, and sulfur appeared on the XPS curve of the membrane, and the surface O/S ratio was determined to be 11.38 by comparing the peak area of these elements. In contrast, for the bulk PSf-b-PEG material the O/S ratio is calculated to be 6.67 by considering that the percentage of PEG blocks in the copolymer is 21wt% if we assume that both PSf and PEG blocks are homogeneously distributed throughout the membrane. The higher content of oxygen on the surface of the PSf-b-PEG membrane suggests the selective enrichment of PEG chains on the membrane surface because S exists only in the PSf block whereas O is present in both blocks. A higher surface O/S ratio than the bulk value implies that more PEG chains are migrated to the membrane surface. The presence of PEG chains on the membrane surface was confirmed by the characterization of WCAs although it does not necessarily imply that there are more PEG chains on the membrane surface than in the membrane interior. The WCA of PSf homopolymer membranes was about 72deg; however, the PSf-b-PEG membranes prepared from varied copolymer concentrations all exhibited a WCA of approximately 65deg. The reduced WCA suggests an enhanced surface hydrophilicity mainly caused by the presence of water-affinitive PEG chains on the surface as all the membranes show a similar surface topography [31]. The enhanced hydrophilicity is very much desired because it promises better water permeability and fouling resistance, which will be discussed later.",292,"The PEG blocks in the copolymer are expected to be preferentially enriched on the membrane surface during the NIPS process because of the effect of surface segregation [7].

593,593,"The pure water permeability (PWP) and retention to BSA of PSf-b-PEG membranes prepared from various copolymer concentrations are shown in Fig. 3. There is a general trend that with the copolymer concentration in the casting solutions increased from 14% to 18% PWP is decreased from ~420 to 270Lm-2h-1bar-1 whereas BSA rejection is increased from ~60% to 90%. The decreasing PWPs and increasing rejections with copolymer concentrations can be easily explained by the tightening skin layer of the membrane with increasing polymer solutions, which has been frequently observed in many different polymer/solvent/nonsolvent systems [25,32]. The level of BSA rejections in the range of 60-90% indicates that the produced membranes at various copolymer concentrations are all in the UF range. Compared to other PSf-based UF membranes using different hydrophilic additives including PEG homopolymers, our membranes prepared in this work are outstanding. Our membranes usually exhibit one to two times higher PWP than other membranes with similar rejections. For instance, the PSf-b-PEG membrane prepared at 18% copolymer concentration maintains 90% BSA retention while its PWP reaches 255Lm-2h-1bar-1. In contrast, PSf membranes prepared using polymer-grafted TiO2 nanoparticles [33] and chitosan derivatives [34] as additives exhibited similar BSA retentions but their PWPs were as low as 31 and 115Lm-2h-1bar-1, respectively. Furthermore, PSf membranes prepared using PEG homopolymer as the additive exhibited a slightly lower water flux (210Lm-2h-1bar-1) and a much lower BSA retention (56%) [35]. The BSA rejections of the membranes vary between 60% and 90% depending on the copolymer concentrations while the permeances maintain at relatively high level, which offers us the flexibility to tune the membrane discrimination properties to fit changing application occasions simply by adjusting the copolymer concentrations in the casting solutions. We also tested the MWCO of the membrane prepared from 15% copolymer concentration which exhibited the largest PWP of 455Lm-2h-1bar-1 among all the membranes prepared from different copolymer concentrations. As shown in Fig. 4, the membrane recorded a MWCO of 70kDa which suggests that the membrane can reject 90% of molecules with a molecular weight of 70kDa. According to the definition of MWCO, the membrane should give a rejection rate higher than 90% to BSA which has a molecular weight of 67kDa. However, as indicated in Fig. 3, the tested rejection of the membrane is 75%, smaller than the value expected from the MWCO. This inconsistence may be ascribed to the difference in the different conditions as well as in the molecular shape of BSA and dextran. In the tests of BSA rejections and MWCOs the BSA concentration and the total dextran concentration are 0.5g/L and 6.5g/L, respectively, and the big difference in the concentration of solutes may influence their penetration through the membrane. In addition, BSA is in the shape of ellipsoids [36], and is therefore, more difficult to penetrate the membrane pores compared to glucose which is in a linear thread-like shape [37].",475,"The pure water permeability (PWP) and retention to BSA of PSf-b-PEG membranes prepared from various copolymer concentrations are shown in Fig. 3.

On the other hand, the porous structure can form catalytic channels, which can effectively reduce the mass transfer resistance, and the channels can enhance the diffusion of hydrolytic products, avoiding further reaction of the hydrolytic products. According to the reported work, although the ionic liquids functioned membranes can be fabricated, the results showed that only the membrane separation performance was improved with sacrificing the catalytic activity. Therefore, developing ionic liquids functioned catalytic membranes must make considering the following factors: Firstly, the combination between ionic liquid and membrane should be built by a strong connection, which can avoid the leaching of ionic liquid during the catalytic process. The second point is to maintain enough active sites of the ionic liquid. The third is optimizing the membrane structure with appropriate mechanical strength and excellent pore structure. According to our previous work, we prepared one catalytic membrane by grafting acidic ionic liquids (ILs) into the polypropylene fibrous (PPF) membrane, where the PPF membrane should be firstly modified with self-made long-distance and dynamic low-temperature (LDDLT) plasma flow technique. The result showed that ILs-g-PPF catalytic membrane could be successfully fabricated by free radical polymerization, and illustrated the promising potential application of inulin catalysis [34]. Although this method provided a good chemical bond to ensure the stable situation of ILs, the degree of the grafted catalyst may be low because of the intrinsic hindrance of the membrane for LDDLT process.",301,"Among the supporters, porous membrane, distinguished by its porosity, high surface area, simple operation, and economic feature, has been considered as a promising candidate as a solid substrate for the immobilization of ionic liquids [32,33].

In short, there are two main types of membranes for building a catalytic membrane reactor: (i) catalytic permselective membranes which synergistically carry out reactions and separations [35,36] and (ii) catalytic nonpermselective membranes which is although catalytically active, not permselective [37,38]. In our case, the membrane belongs to the second type. The porous catalytic membrane has the characteristics of large specific surface area, simple operation, high flexibility and low cost. Also, it is an excellent carrier for solid catalyst immobilization. On the other hand, either inorganic catalyst, porous polymer monolith or porous catalytic membranes, they can catalyze the hydrolysis reaction. However, there are significant differences in the contact mode between reactants and catalytically active sites. The feed passes through the rich network-like pore channels of the catalytic membrane by forced flow filtration operation mode, which strengthens the internal mass transfer and the contact between reactants and catalytic sites, while in the internal pore channels of porous polymer monolith or inorganic catalyst, the reactants entry and product departure are in diffusion mode with great mass transfer resistance, especially for the molecular chains of polymer reactants. In short, the well-designed structure of catalytic membranes will be of benefit to promote catalytic performance, which can provide better and efficient reaction channels, also improve the diffusion and separating of hydrolyzed products from the feed mixture. The microporous channel of the membranes can provide the rapid convective flow of reactants, thus the conversion efficiency of reactants will be promoted preferably [37,38]. In any case, the design and preparation of catalytically active membranes are extremely critical and challenging. Especially, polymeric catalytically active membranes have attracted much intense attention because of the unique feature of polymer membranes [37,39-45]. Therefore, developing an effective strategy to preferentially form the active sites on polymer membrane, and simultaneously make the catalytic membranes equipped with appropriate mechanical strength is highly desirable but rarely reported.",341,"In addition, membrane reactors have developed into an important branch of membrane science and technology, which have played a great role in the traditional industry and new energy resources field.

When the concentration of inulin increased from 10 wt% to 40 wt%, the yield of hydrolysis decreased. Although the TRS ratio at the concentration of 10 wt% was higher than the others, the yield of reducing sugar was relatively low, which is unfavorable to the subsequent use of the reducing sugar product. Additionally, the hydrolysis rate of inulin will decrease significantly under the high inulin concentration (30 wt% and 40 wt%), which can be explained by the dissolution-diffusion mechanism. The inulin has a solubility between 6 wt % and 35 wt % at various temperatures [61]. When the concentration of inulin",n,1.0

However, the TRS of 23.4 L/(m2*h) is higher than that of 15.6 L/(m2*h), because the beneficial effect of improved flow conditions on TRS is greater than the adverse effect of shortened residence time. As for the TRS of 23.4 L/(m2*h) at the beginning of the experiment is smaller than that of 15.6 L/(m2*h), it is the result of the adsorption of low-concentration hydrolysates on the membrane pore surface at the beginning of the experiment.

The ultrafiltration (UF) membrane with surface pore size in the range of 1-100 nm has been considered as an optimal choice due to the predominance in rejecting proteins, bacteria and organics from a raw water [28,29]. However, the intrinsic hydrophobicity or moderate hydrophilicity of the common polymer materials leads to the poor oil resistance of the corresponding membranes during emulsion separation.

683,683,"As shown in Fig. 3a, the pristine PSF membrane is moderately hydrophilic with a WCA of 79.3deg in air and comparatively underwater oleophilic with a UWOCA of 98.8deg (n-tetradecane). In contrast, the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane presents evident superhydrophilicity with its WCA quickly decreased to nearly zero as well as outstanding underwater superoleophobicity with an UWOCA of 155.8deg (Fig. 3b). Since the properties of coating are relevant to the immersion time and the assembly cycles, we investigated the effects of various coating parameters on the structure and wettability of the PA-FeIII complexes accumulated on the PSF membrane. First, we changed the immersion time of the PSF membrane in the PA solution while keeping the other experimental conditions unchanged. The results in Fig. S3a indicate that prolonged immersion time in the PA bath made the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane surface more hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic. Once the immersion time reached ~300 s, the resultant PA-FeIII/PSF membrane could achieve superhydrophilicity together with prominent underwater superoleophobicity. The above results suggest that sufficient reaction time is necessary for immobilizing a compact PA molecular layer on the moderately hydrophilic PSF substrate by hydrogen bonding at room temperature. Once the sedimentary PA-FeIII complexes are formed through strong chelation between PA molecules and FeIII ions, preservation of more unreacted phosphonic acid groups on the surface are more effective in improving the water affinity of the PSF membrane. Besides, the network constructed by the rough complex aggregations contains numerous nanoscale cavities to trap water.

684,684,"The PSF membrane provided a water permeation flux of 537.2 L m-2 h-1*bar-1 in average (Fig. S3b). With the deposition of the PA-FeIII complexes, the flux continuously declined with the immersion time in the PA bath. The membrane subjected to 300-s immersion gave a reduced flux of 161.1 L m-2 h-1*bar-1. It is reasonable to infer that the decoration of the PA-FeIII complex aggregations on the PSF membrane narrowed down the pore size and increased the resistance for water transport. Because the thickness of the PA-FeIII complex layer can be regulated by the layer-by-layer deposition mode, we further investigated the influence of PA-FeIII assembly cycles on the water permeation flux and rejection performance of the modified membranes. Fig. S4 summarizes the water permeation flux and BSA rejection of the PA-FeIII/PSF membranes prepared with various cycle numbers of the PA-FeIII assembly. The flux of the PSF membrane continuously decreased by raising the cycle number till a dramatic reduction to 16.8 L m-2 h-1*bar-1 upon 6-cycle deposition. The BSA rejection of the pristine PSF membrane increased from 59.5% to 92.8% upon 1-cycle deposition of the PA-FeIII complexes. Since the aggregations covered on the membrane surface or the pore walls could narrow down the pore size, the separation efficiency of the modified membrane was expected to improve at the sacrifice of the permeation flux. However, when the assembly cycle ran to 4 and 6, both the flux and the BSA rejection decreased, that was against the 'trade-off' theory describing the relation between permeability and selectivity [43,44]. The surface morphologies of the PA-FeIII/PSF membranes treated with different cycle numbers are displayed in Fig. S5. We noticed that the thicker coating layers derived from excessive accumulation of PA-FeIII complexes cracked and partly delaminated on the PSF membrane. The deteriorated compactness of the surface structure is supposed to be responsible for the reduction of the BSA rejection rates.

The tiny surface pores were thus quickly blocked and no permeation flux was gained. Whereas, the phosphonic acid groups on the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane surface had good hydration ability. A large number of water molecules could also be trapped into the nanoscale voids in the rough PA-FeIII complex layer. The strong repulsive force between polar (water) and non-polar (oil) molecules effectively promoted the oil droplets to detach from the surface and restrained the fouling of the membrane.",n,1.0
691,691,"Inspired by the wettability, surface charge and narrowed pore size of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane [48,49], we explored its separation performance for water-soluble organic dye molecules by the UF setup. The selected dyes in the solution (10 ppm, pH 7) covered cationic dyes MR (MW: 269.3), MeB (MW: 373.9) and RhB (MW: 479.01), and anionic dyes MO (MW: 327.33), MB (MW: 799.8) and CR (MW: 696.66). In the light of the results displayed in Fig. 7a, the rejection efficiencies of the pristine PSF membrane were lower than 20% for all the dyes, disclosing feeblish separation ability. On the contrary, the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane exhibited much higher rejection rates for the various dye molecules, which was verified by the faded characteristic colors of tested dye solutions in the visible range after the UF process (Fig. S7). In detail, dye rejections of 85.9% for MR, 63.7% for MO, 86.9% for MeB, 88.5% for RhB, 97.9% for MB and 99.4% for CR were achieved, respectively, as concluded in Fig. 7a. The rejection generally follows the order of CR > MB > RhB > MeB > MO > MR, which is approximately consistent with the increasing trend of the molecular weight of the dyes. Although the molecular weight of CR is smaller than that of MB, a slightly higher rejection rate was obtained for CR because the spatial structure of CR (2.5 x1.3) is more expanded than that of MB (2.18 x1.15) [19]. The larger diameter made the CR molecules more difficult to penetrate the membrane pores. Therefore, the size sieving by the membrane nanochannels is believed as the dominant factor in retention of the organic dye molecules. For MeB and MO molecules with the similar molecular weight, the rejection rate of the cationic dye MeB was moderately higher than that of the anionic dye MO. This difference is probably due to the negatively-charged PA-FeIII/PSF membrane surface (zeta potential of -27.2 mV at neutral pH), which contributed to the adsorption of cationic dye molecules via strong electrostatic attraction. In combination with the MWCO results shown in Fig. 4a, the deposition of the PA-FeIII complex layer on the PSF UF membrane can effectively narrow down the pore size to the range that is qualified for rejections of diverse organic dyes.",373,"Inspired by the wettability, surface charge and narrowed pore size of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane [48,49], we explored its separation performance for water-soluble organic dye molecules by the UF setup.

702,702,"Increasing the hydrophilicity of the membranes and introducing surface charge are commonly used approaches to prevent fouling (Bilad et al., 2012a; Marbelia et al., 2016a). The adhesion forces between the membrane surface and water increase with increasing membrane hydrophilicity, resulting in a strong adsorbed layer of water molecules on the membrane surface. As a result, less attachment is found between the foulant and membrane surface (Zhu and Jun Loh, 2015). Introducing surface charge is an efficient approach to eliminate charged foulants. When the membrane surface and the foulants have similar charge, electrostatic repulsion can prevent the foulants from attaching to the surface, therefore mitigating fouling and enhancing membrane fluxes (Zhong et al., 2012). The foulants in a microalgal broth mainly come from microalgal cells and extracellular organic matter (EOM). Their charge is normally negative, mainly due to sulphated extracellular polysaccharides, carboxylic acids, uronic acids or acidic sugars on the cell surface and suspended in the broth (Marbelia et al., 2016b; Zaouk et al., 2018). A membrane with higher hydrophilicity and negative charge may thus present a better anti-fouling performance and higher membrane fluxes. A negatively charged polycarbonate (PC) membrane has thus been used to harvest Chlorella vulgris (C. vulgris), showing higher hydrophilicity, microalgal retention and membrane flux (Huang et al., 2020). A negatively charged polyacrylonitrile membrane was used to harvest eight types of microalgae, also showing higher water permeances and less fouling (Marbelia et al., 2016b).

732,732,"To investigate the effects of pattern shape, the membranes were prepared using four different patterned knives (wave, triangle, rectangle and trapezoid) with fixed PSf, sPSf, PEG and deionized water concentrations of 13.5w%, 4.5w%, 25w% and 1w% in the membrane casting solutions, respectively. Three flat membranes (F-sNIPS, F-NIPS and F-PSf) with the same wet casting thickness were prepared for comparison. Membranes were first potted in a dead-end filtration system to determine the CWP and the membrane flux in a microalgal broth (Fig. 5). The patterned membranes were more water-permeable compared with the flat membranes (Fig. 5a), in line with previous studies (Marbelia et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020b, 2021). The flat membranes prepared by adding 4.5w% sPSF showed a higher CWP. Incorporation of sPSf improves the affinity between water and the membrane surface (i.e. higher hydrophilicity, Table 1) by creating more hydrogen bonds and enhancing polar interactions (Luo et al., 2017). In addition, the porosity, mean pore size and hydrophilicity also increase, therefore facilitating transport of water (Song et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2020a, 2021). The CWP of the F-sNIPS membrane was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of F-NIPS, indicating that mere use of the s-NIPS method did increase the membrane permeability. Similar results were explained in a previous study (Marbelia et al., 2020). All these results showed that the high CWP of the patterned membrane was not only caused by the extended surface area and the introduction of charges, but can also be partly intrinsically ascribed to the s-NIPS method.",252,"To investigate the effects of pattern shape, the membranes were prepared using four different patterned knives (wave, triangle, rectangle and trapezoid) with fixed PSf, sPSf, PEG and deionized water concentrations of 13.5w%, 4.5w%, 25w% and 1w% in the membrane casting solutions, respectively. Three flat membranes (F-sNIPS, F-NIPS and F-PSf) with the same wet casting thickness were prepared for comparison. Membranes were first potted in a dead-end filtration system to determine the CWP and the membrane flux in a microalgal broth (Fig. 5). The patterned membranes were more water-permeable compared with the flat membranes (Fig. 5a), in line with previous studies (Marbelia et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020b, 2021). The flat membranes prepared by adding 4.5w% sPSF showed a higher CWP. Incorporation of sPSf improves the affinity between water and the membrane surface (i.e. higher hydrophilicity, Table 1) by creating more hydrogen bonds and enhancing polar interactions (Luo et al.,",n,0.99902934
733,733,"A similar trend was found when harvesting microalgae (Fig. 5b). The harvesting efficiency of each membrane was higher than 99%, validating the feasibility of harvesting microalgal biomass. Interestingly, while the CWPs of F-NIPS and F-PSf had no significant difference (P>0.05), the membrane fluxes of these two membranes in the microalgal broth showed significant differences (P<0.05). This can be linked to the fact that most of the microalgal cells are surrounded by carboxylic acids, uronic acids or acidic sugars, hence carrying negative charges that are rejected by the membrane surface charge (Marbelia et al., 2016b; Zhao et al., 2020a). Membrane flux can thus effectively be enhanced when less microalgal cells and/or EOM deposit on the membrane surface. For the patterned membranes, the Wave-membrane showed the highest CWP and membrane flux in the microalgal broth, followed by the Tri, Trap and Rec membranes. The patterned and flat membranes were potted in a cross-flow filtration system to investigate the effect of pattern shape on filtration performance (Fig. 6). The anti-fouling property of each membrane was evaluated using CP. With step-wise increasing the pressure, the fouling on the membrane surface became more significant. A higher CP therefore represents a higher anti-fouling capacity. The experimental limit was at 2.5 bar. Compared with the F-PSf membrane (CP=2.5 bar), all other membranes showed a CP higher than 2.5 bar, thus proving the efficiency of incorporating sPSf as anti-fouling strategy. The filtration curves of Tri and Trap membranes almost overlap, which is in line with the results in the dead-end filtration system. These two shapes thus rendered similar filtration performance. The filtration curves of all patterned membranes are situated above those of the flat membranes. Even after 8-h filtration, they still can give a relatively high membrane flux. For the patterned membranes, more microalgal cells were deposited in the valley regions rather than on the ridges, probably due to the enhanced wall shear on the ridge regions or the different local fluxes (Marbelia et al., 2020; Maruf et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2020b). For the flat membranes, the cake layer can easily cover the whole membrane surface due to the constant flow behavior on the membrane (Zhao et al., 2020b, 2021). The filtration curve of the Wave-membrane is situated above that of the other membranes, indicating that the wave shape does significantly improve the filtration performance.",389,"A similar trend was found when harvesting microalgae (Fig. 5b).

A flat PSf membrane used in the cross-flow system for C. pyrenoidosa harvesting, showed a maximum CWP of 270 L/m2 h bar and a broth flux of 92 L/m2 h bar (Sun et al., 2014). A negatively charged PC membrane was used for C. vulgaris harvesting, showing a maximum membrane flux in a microalgal broth of 133 L/m2 h bar (Huang et al., 2020). A recent study using flat PVDF membranes without surface pattern in tilted panel and axial vibration systems to harvest Euglena sp. and C. pyrenoidosa showed membrane permeances of 724 and 640 L/m2 h bar, respectively (Lau et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2016a). Even with enhanced shear near the membrane surface (i.e. 14,512 s-1) and lower microalgal concentration (i.e. 0.6 g/L of Euglena sp. and 0.55 g/L of C. pyrenoidosa), the membrane permeances were still much lower than those reported here using negatively charged membranes with a wave pattern. All negatively charged patterned membranes in current study showed a significantly higher membrane permeance in both microalgal broth (up to 1000 L/m2 h bar) and CWP (up to 2250 L/m2 h bar), indicating an important advantage of the synergy between surface charge and pattern.

735,735,"The profiles of interaction energies between microalgal cells and three flat membranes as a function of the separation distance are shown in Fig. 7. A positive value represents a repulsive energy; a negative value an attractive energy. The interaction energy curves of F-sNIPS and F-NIPS almost overlap, indicating a similar interaction energy with microagal cells for these two membranes, as could be expected. This confirms that phase inversion does not change the membrane surface property. With decreasing the distance between microalgal cells and membrane surface, repulsive electrostatic and attractive Van der Waals energies all increase (Figs. 7b and d). The total interaction energy profile shows an actual microalgal adhesion energy barrier on the membrane surface that the microalgal cells must overcome an energy barrier (Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, a higher repulsive energy barrier represents that only a small part of microalgal cells can eventually adhere on the membrane surface even though the interaction energy at minimum separation distance is highly negative. The energy barriers significantly increase after incorporating sPSf in the membranes, while s-NIPS method does not give significant improvement (Fig. 7a). Similar interaction free energies trends were also found in a previous study (Wang et al., 2014), where the interaction energy between a PVDF membrane and sludge flocs (both surface charges are negative) also showed attractive LW and AB energies, a repulsive EL energy and a high energy barrier. Analogously, the interaction energy properties of the F-sNIPS membrane can approximately represent these of the patterned membranes as well.",250,"The profiles of interaction energies between microalgal cells and three flat membranes as a function of the separation distance are shown in Fig. 7.

805,805,"In addition, the emulsion separation treatment of the membranes is also dependent on the content of the emulsion feed, and particularly the quantity and size of oil droplets that cause fouling on the membrane. During crossflow filtration, the emulsified oil droplets are directed towards the membrane surface and simultaneously carried away by the path flow. At the initial stage of filtration, the deposited oil droplets may partially obstruct the surface pores, resulting in a gradual drop in permeance. Further filtration over long periods would cause the oil droplets to accumulate and adhere on the surface, penetrating and blocking the pores to eventually form a cake layer. The thermodynamic instability of packed oil droplets in the cake layer causes the tendency for coalescence, making the resulting cake layer highly dense and thereby intensifying its resistance to water penetration [54] and increasing the rejection rate. In summary, if the emulsion feed has a large number of oil droplets, the tendency to form a cake layer would be greater and hence the rejection performance would increase, and vice versa. Hence, in the present study, the rejection performance with the emulsion containing 900 ppm oil (high oil content) was the greatest, and that of emulsion containing 100 ppm oil (low oil content) was the lowest, for all of the membranes.

It was proven that the incorporation of TiO2 NPs had a tremendous effect on the rheological properties of the casting solutions, which consequently affected the casting solution thermodynamics and the kinetics of phase de-mixing. This resulted in membranes with desirable asymmetric sponge-like morphologies and properties essential for filtration and antifouling activity. High NP concentrations resulted in membranes with high porosity and dense top layers; this led to poor water permeation due to the resistance of the selective layer, and poor rejection as the high porosity allowed more oil particles to pass through under high pressure. In contrast, relatively low NP concentrations reduced porosity and caused the membranes to have very thin, dense top layers. The flux improved but the rejection was still poor. Thus, an optimal NP concentration was determined as 0.075 wt% (M2). High oil rejection rates were attained with a 900 ppm oil concentration emulsion feed, with a maximum oil rejection of 95% achieved by the membrane with the thickest selective top layer (M9).

Herein, the separation performances of as-prepared PSf membrane for salt containing aqueous were systematically evaluated, wherein the performances of lab-made solely hydrophobic PSf membrane and commercial hydrophobic PVDF were also evaluated as comparison (their morphologies and liquid wetting behaviors were given in Fig. S2). During the separation experiments, 3.5 wt% NaCl solution with and without surfactant SDS was used as the feed solution respectively and vapor flux and salt rejection were measured to characterize the DCMD performance of these membranes. As observed from Fig. 8(a, c), the vapor fluxes of both lab-made amphiphobic and solely hydrophobic PSf membrane were about 5 L/m2h, which was much lower than the 30 L/m2h of commercial PVDF membrane. On the bright side, the amphiphobic PSf membrane showed highly stable salt rejection rate of 99.99% for both pure NaCl solution and complex NaCl solution with SDS during the whole testing time, while the salt rejection rate of solely hydrophobic PSf and PVDF membrane experienced a dramatically downward trend at 70 min. Especially when SDS was dispersed in salt solution, the rejection rate of the latter two membranes severely decreased from original 99.95% and 99.97%-89.97% and 93.87%, respectively. The relatively lower vapor flux of lab-made PSf membranes may be ascribed to the microstructural difference compared with commercial PVDF membrane. Symmetric-like structure with pore size of about 5 mm for commercial PVDF membrane could be observed from the supporting information in Fig. S2, while asymmetrical structure with an obvious dense top layer (surface pore size below 50 nm) could be observed in Fig. 1(a and b). As a result, the pore size difference of ~100 folds leaded to vapor flux difference of ~6 folds owing to the higher diffusion resistance of our lab-made PSf membrane.",310,"The superior amphiphobic PSf membrane with double re-entrant structure was expected to be a promising anti-fouling and anti-wetting membrane for DCMD process.

To seek verification, the distribution of NaCl in both surface and cross-section of as-prepared amphiphobic PSf and commercial PVDF membranes after DCMD measurement was detected by EDS mapping of Na and Cl elements to evaluating their fouling behavior. From the surface views as shown in Fig. 9, relatively small amount of Na and Cl elements were detected for amphiphobic PSf membrane compared with commercial hydrophobic PVDF membrane and the introduction of SDS would simultaneously increase the adhesive amount of NaCl onto both amphiphobic PSf and solely hydrophobic PVDF membrane surface, due to its effect on greatly reducing the surface tension difference between salt solution and membrane surface. Significant advantages could be found in the cross-section views as shown in Fig. 10. Slight amount of Na and Cl elements could be found for amphiphobic PSf membrane even with SDS, while large amount of that was still observed for hydrophobic PVDF membrane in both cases, indicating the intrusion of NaCl into its deeper pores. These results revealed that the surface fouling of amphiphobic PSf membrane was slightly better than the control one and the intrusion of feed solution into the amphiphobic PSf membrane could be relatively well-avoided, exhibiting better anti-fouling and anti-wetting performance. Accordingly, the higher and stable salt rejection of amphiphobic PSf membrane was not caused by the existed dense skin layer but the non-intrusion of feed solution into membrane pores, which essentially benefited from its superior amphiphobic property. As for the lower vapor flux, it would be improved by eliminating the dense skin layer in view of the good pore-size-controllability of PSf membrane through NIPS technology.",288,"One may doubt that the higher and stable salt rejection rate of amphiphobic PSf membrane benefits from the relatively dense skin layer.

853,853,"The large quantity of polluted wastewater generated by petroleum refineries requires treatment technologies to remove hazardous contaminants [1]. In general, the refinery industry generates a wastewater volume that is about 0.4-1.6 times greater than that of the volume of refined oil [2]. Petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) usually contains a high concentration of contaminants, such as dissolved oil, organics, hydrocarbon derivatives, heavy metals, phenolic compounds, ammonia, and a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD) [3,4]. As reported in many studies, PRW generally contains dissolved oil and grease at 500-3000 mg.L-1, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at 750-1600 mg.L-1 and 300 -1000 mg.L-1, respectively [5]. Toxic organics, such as phenolic compounds, are found in PRW at approximately 950 mg.L-1, and ammonia and sulfide are typically at 20-80 mg.L-1 and 13-17 mg.L-1, respectively [6]. In some cases, heavy metals and radioactive materials are observed in refinery wastewaters [7]. Existing PRW treatments usually only reduce the total solids and major organic pollutants; however, this treated wastewater still contains phenolic compounds and ammonia at high concentrations. Phenolic compounds are identified as priority contaminants as they are highly toxic and corrosive even at a low concentration [8]. The sources of phenolic compounds in PRW are usually from the tank water drain, multiphase separator, desalter water effluent, and neutralized spent caustic waste. In Pertamina Ltd. Indonesia, the primary source of the phenols, is the residual fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) waste stream with an average phenol concentration of 960 mg.L-1 [6]. In recent years, phenol and its derivatives have warranted more attention in the field of industrial wastewater because of their toxicity and contamination in wastewater production. Phenolic compounds discharged into the environment remain for long periods and harm the ecosystem, especially humans [9,10].

857,857,"In recent decades, many attempts have been made to eliminate contaminants in PRW, such as the advanced oxidation process (AOP), coagulation, absorption, adsorption, chemical, and biological treatments [16-18]. Such methods effectively remove a variety of organic compounds. However, membrane separation is considered a faster and more efficient process than other physically-driven and equilibrium-driven processes. Conventional size exclusion based separations such as Ultrafiltration is unable to remove phenolic compounds or ammonia with high separation efficiency [19]. Hence, a dense membrane, such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration membrane, is required, resulting in high energy consumption [20] and faster fouling formation. A hybrid process, such as the adsorption prior to membrane separation, has been previously reported [21] using activated carbon followed by an ultrafiltration membrane. This process effectively reduced energy consumption. However, the process is complex as it requires more than one stage. In the past few years, the membrane research is dominated by the development of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that combine the molecular sieving mechanism and adsorption of inorganic filler; furthermore, the introduction of inorganic material significantly increases the surface properties, mechanical strength, and perm-selectivity of the fabricated membrane [22]. Polymeric membranes with an embedded microsized inorganic filler have shown excellent performance in removing various organic compounds during water treatment, and the membrane's hydrophilic property can be significantly improved. However, the incorporation of inorganic filler at normal size (micron scale) into polymeric membranes has the risk of producing defective membranes. A defect membrane might be caused by the formation unselective void as the result of the de-attachment between the polymer and the particle surface [23]. Recent developments include the incorporation of nanosized inorganic particles because of their higher surface area, high shape uniformity, and excellent affinity with a polymer matrix [24]. Many researchers have reported that the incorporation of nanosized inorganic materials and functionalized metal oxides into a polymeric membrane significantly enhance the permeability, structural properties, surface hydrophilicity, antifouling behavior, and separation properties [25,26]. However, in some cases of wastewater with a high organic level, such as PRW, the utilization of the nanohybrid membrane has a short lifetime because of surface fouling [27].

Fouling in the membrane gradually decreases the permeation flux and also reduces the lifespan of the membrane; therefore, the membrane application is not economically feasible. In this work, the PVA coating was used to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane. The examination of the fouling can be performed by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitative analysis can be performed through a fouling autopsy to indicate the foulant deposition on the membrane [46]. In this study, a quantitative approach was conducted to evaluate how much the membrane modification can mitigate the fouling formation during PRW treatment. A series model of the resistance equation derived from Darcy's law was used to examine the resistance created by the foulant.

However, the Rm of the membrane increases as the PVA coating is applied. This increase in Rm might be because the PVA coating decreased the size of the surface pores on the membrane, forming a denser membrane. Alternatively, the PVA addition increases the selective layer thickness, thus increasing the resistance. The lowest resistance from the absorbed foulant was shown by the membrane with a 2 wt% PVA coating. The highest cake resistance was shown by a neat PSf membrane that has a slightly hydrophobic surface and unrepaired properties.

In this regard, polysulfone (PSF) microspheres, a kind of novel polymer microspheres, are expected to be used for water treatment owing to their superior structural stability, electronegativity, and formability (Ji et al., 2018). To enhance their adsorption performance, various organic/inorganic materials, such as polydopamine, polyacrylic acid, ionic liquids, N,N,N',N'-tetraoctyldiglycolamide, HNO3-treated bamboo charcoal and metallic oxide, have been combined with PSF to prepare composite adsorbent (Ji et al., 2018; Posati et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Rahayu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021a). However, these composites may suffer problems such as compatibility and cycling stability, which undoubtedly decline the adsorption performance of microsphere. Surface coating of adhesion containing functional groups or modified with a carboxylic acid group through interface co-assemble and deposition are feasible approach to regulate surface chemical constituents. Whereas, modification of functional groups in these tactics is easy to de-bonding under strong acid and alkali environment, and the deprotonation of adsorbent could only be soaked in triethylamine for a long time (Jin et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021a).

In our previous work, porous hollow polysulfone microspheres with submicron sponge-like core-shell structure have been prepared, which could be ideal adsorbents for cationic dyes after modified with negatively charged groups, considering the high specific surface area and abundant active sites provided. In addition, the presence of aromatic rings in the PSF structure is conducive to form the p-p stacking interaction with positively charged dyes containing aromatic rings (Ai et al., 2011).

In the spectrum of CMPSF, the peak at 750 cm-1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration peak of C-Cl (Li et al., 2018). The appearance of the peak around 2125 cm-1 is associated with the azide group, indicating the successful azidation of PH-PSF microspheres (Guiver et al., 1995). The peak at 1727 cm-1 is ascribed to -CO in the spectrum of PH-CPSF, which is the evidence of -COOH (Dong et al., 2009).

Moreover, the presence of aromatic rings in the PH-CPSF structure is conducive to the p-p stacking interaction of cationic dyes with aromatic rings (Ghorai et al., 2014). Therefore, the excellent adsorption capacity of the PH-CPSF could attribute to the inter-molecular interactions between MB and the surface of the PH-CPSF, including p-p interaction, hydrogen bonding, strong charge attraction and weak charge attraction, as depicted in adsorption mechanism diagram (Fig. 4b).

The removal rate of MB can reach up to 99.25% as the initial pH of MB solution at 10, which can be attributed to the enhanced dissociation ability of the carboxyl group on the PH-CPSF after protonation (Madrakian et al., 2011). When the initial solution pH is less than 3, the electronegativity of PH-CPSF microspheres is reduced due to the protonation of the carboxyl matrix, and the accumulation of MB on the surface of the adsorbent inhibits subsequent dye adsorption, resulting in a decreasing adsorption capacity.

923,923,"Sulfonated degree of polymer plays a ""trade-off"" relationship with the salt rejection of membrane, and plays a positive correlation with the water flux of membrane. These are because that highly sulfonated degree of polymer usually induces high swelling of the membranes in water. In order to obtain high salt rejection of prepared membrane, using polymer with low sulfonated degree and crosslinking treatment are two selectable methods. Park et al. [18] used a series of sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymers (BPS) synthesized from 3,3'-disulfonato-4,4'-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone and 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone to prepare desalination membrane. The results indicated that the salt rejection of fabricated membranes was inverse proportionality with the percentage of sulfone groups on synthesized polymer. A continuously chlorine-resistant test was ran to compare the chlorine resistance of membrane prepared by sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymers and PA membrane. The results showed that the salt rejection of sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) membrane did not change under 10,000 ppm*hours of continuous exposure to chlorine. However, the salt rejection of PA membrane declined by more than 20% under the same condition. Lee et al.

Through adjusting the coating conditions, the NaCl rejection of membranes could reach to 97%. To the polymer of high sulfonated degree, crosslinking is an available method to restrict polymer swelling in water. Paul et al.

Finally, the NaCl rejection of obtained membrane could reach to 97.2% through controlling crosslinking conditions. By contrast, the NaCl rejection of non-crosslinked membrane was only 73.4%.

In order to solve this problem, a surfactant, tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), was added into polymer solution for decreasing the surface tension of coating solution.

956,956,"The non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method is widely reported to fabricate polymeric membranes and microspheres with asymmetric structures, owing to its simplicity of operation and adjustability. In a typical NIPS process, the polymer is dissolved in a solvent to form a homogeneous polymer solution. After the polymer solution is immersing in the non-solvent bath, the solvent and the non-solvent are spontaneously mixed, which reduces the free energy of the polymer and causes the polymer to solidify and shape [15]. In our previous report, PSF hollow microspheres were prepared by NIPS method, but the microspheres possessed non-porous shell due to the effect of interfacial tension of the two immiscible phases [9]. Adding linear polymers and oligomer (e.g., toluene, oleic acid, glycerin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol) as the porogen is a general method to create porous structure through NIPS [16]. Among them, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is widely used in virtue of its water solubility and polymer compatibility. Moreover, the molecular weights (Mw) of the PEG can be adjusted to control the phase behaviors and the resulting structures. Wu et al. investigated the effect of various Mw of PEG on the pore size of the porous membrane during the preparation of porous PAN membranes by NIPS method. It was found that both the Mw and density of PEG had an influence on the process of phase separation to produce membranes with different pore sizes [17]. Lin et al. also studied the effect of Mw of PEG on the thermodynamic behavior of mixing-demixing during phase separation for PVDF membranes preparation, and found that the degree of phase separation of PEG during the phase inversion process produced different types of membrane pores [18]. Although the reported study of using the PEG porogen via NIPS method are limited to porous membrane materials fabrication, we believed it can be adopted to create porous structure on shell of the PSF hollow microspheres. Except the pore size, the microspheres size could also been influenced by the adding of PEG of different Mw, since they may change the solubility parameters of the water phase in the oil phase [19].",349,"The non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method is widely reported to fabricate polymeric membranes and microspheres with asymmetric structures, owing to its simplicity of operation and adjustability.

973,973,"The SEM images of PHPSF and PSF microspheres of overall and surface topography (inner image) are displayed in Fig. 1. It can be clearly observed in Fig. 1(a) that the PSF microspheres exhibit a smooth surface with the diameters of 55.19 +- 5.69 um. Different from the PSF microspheres, the PHPSF microspheres possess sub-micron pores (<=2-3 um) on the surface, and the size is ranging from 75 to 105 um (Fig. 1b-f). Interestingly, a obvious linear relationship between the microspheres diameter and the system viscosity is observed when the viscosity is combined with the diameter of the microspheres (Fig. 1g), with a high level of correlation (Fig. 1h, R2 =0.9458). And the linear relationship is attributed to the increasing difference in viscosity between the dispersed and continuous phases with dispersed phases droplet size increasing [30], which leads to larger diameter of the microspheres after phase inversion. Besides, the increase in viscosity would cause kinetic hindrance to phase separation and lead to delayed phase separation, resulting in a low porosity and thick shells [23]. Therefore, as the increasing of PEG Mw from 600 to 10,000, the porosity of PHPSF microspheres decrease from 75.6% to 65.8% (Fig. 1(i) and Table 2). Meanwhile, the shell thickness of PHPSF microspheres increase from 4.6 to 14.0 um (Fig. S1).

974,974,"During the phase inversion proscess, the degree of phase separation of PEG produces different types of surface pores [18]. The higher the solubility parameters difference (|Dd|), the worse compatibility between PSF-PEG or PEG-solvent, which lead to easier phase separation [16,19]. In contrast, weakening the phase separation ability (decreased the value of |Dd|) is favorable for PEG combined with water to form PEG-rich phase during phase inversion, which further enhances the perforated effect of PEG. According to the |Dd| in Table 3, the weak compatibility between PSF-PEG indicates that PEG can be used as a porogen for PSF. Fig. 3(a-e) shows the size distribution of the pores on the PHPSF microspheres surface, and the average surface pore size is summarized in Fig. 3(f). It could be observed that the PHPSF-1, PHPSF-2 and PHPSF-5 possess macropores and wide distribution, while micropores and narrow distribution are observed on PHPSF-3 and PHPSF-4. According to the |Dd| in Table 3, PEG600 and PEG1000 have weak compatibility with solvents (high |Dd|), which is conductive to phase separation. The early phase separation of oligomeric porogen would lead to the formation of ""large gel"" particles and macropores [31], which is the reason why macropore in PHPSF-1 and PHPSF-2 microspheres forming after added PEG600 and PEG1000. Moreover, the reason of PHPSF-3 and PHPSF-4 microspheres exhibit micropore structure and narrow pore distribution is that their compatibility (low) |Dd|, and the ability of PEG2000 and PEG4000 to combined with water is weakened to form ""small gel"" particles [23,30]. The pore size of PHPSF-4 is increased compared with PHPSF-3, which is attributed to the increasing PEG Mw (chain length) just leading to a PEG-rich phase with higher sterical hindrance and larger pores [32]. In addition, when the length of the PEG chain increases, the configuration of the PEG chain is restricted by the space between two adjacent micelles, and it is difficult to maintain the balance of the osmotic pressure difference between the PEG-rich phase and solvent, with a result of two droplets approaching each other and aggregation [33]. The aggregation of part of the droplets will cause a macroporous structure to appear after phase inversion, and the distribution of microspheres surfaces become wider. Thus, the macroporous formed in PHPSF-5 is caused by the agglomeration of PEG-rich phase. As mentioned above, the degree of PEG phase separation affects the pore structure of PEG during the phase inversion process. As the Mw of PEG below 4000, the low |Dd| is conducive to the formation of microporous structure and narrower pore distribution, while high Mw of PEG tends to agglomerate and form a macroporous structure after phase inversion.",434,"During the phase inversion proscess, the degree of phase separation of PEG produces different types of surface pores [18].

975,975,"The specific surface area of all microspheres were calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherms using the BET method and the relevant data were shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4(a-f). The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms for PSF microspheres reveal that the adsorption type matched the type II adsorption-desorption isotherms model, which means nonporous. The model for desorption hysteresis behavior of PHPSF matches the type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms model, which indicates that presence of mesopores in the microspheres structure [34]. Moreover, with the increaseing of PEG Mw, the N2 desorption curve shows obvious hysteresis, indicating that the number of passing pores of the microspheres increases. The most reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that the addition of PEG causes a morphological change, which converts the previously dead-end or closed pores into passing pores or inter-connected pores. In other words, the connectivity of the previously existing micropores has been improved.

The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms for PSF microspheres reveal that the adsorption type matched the type II adsorption-desorption isotherms model, which means nonporous. The model for desorption hysteresis behavior of PHPSF matches the type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms model, which indicates that presence of mesopores in the microspheres structure [34]. Moreover, with the increaseing of PEG Mw, the N2 desorption curve shows obvious hysteresis, indicating that the number of passing pores of the microspheres increases.

The peaks at 1650 cm-1 (-OH) and 1450 cm-1 (-CH2) are the characteristic absorption peak of PEG [35] (Fig. 5a). The peaks situate at 1640 cm-1, 1481 cm-1, 1237 cm-1 and 1152 cm-1 can be assigned to the aromatic rings, C-O-C linkage and -SO2 stretch, respectively, which implies the presence of PSF [36].

978,978,"As shown in Fig. 6(c), affected by electrostatic attraction and p-p accumulation, the adsorption capacity of PSF and PHPSF microspheres increase rapidly at the initial stage. However, due to the repulsive force generated by the adsorption of abundant MB molecules on PHPSF, the adsorption rate gradually decreases until equilibrium. Moreover, compared with the hollow PSF microspheres, PHPSF microspheres with sponge-like porous spherical shell and core-shell structure exhibit higher adsorption capacity and faster adsorption speed. And the inter-connected porous structure PHPSF microspheres increases the specific surface area of the microspheres and provides more adsorption sites and storage apace both encapsulated inside the porous and adsorbed on the surface. The adsorption capacity of each sample at equilibrium is 0.65, 3.05, 3.56, 3.90, 3.81 and 2.94 mg g-1, respectively. Notably, the absorption capacity of PHPSF-3 is 3.90 mg g-1, which is 6 times that of the pristine PSF microspheres. Therefore, the quasi-first-order model (Fig. 6d), quasi-second-order model (Fig. 6e), and intra-particle diffusion model (Fig. 6f) models were used to investigated the mechanism and related parameters of kinetics of PHPSF. The relevant values are shown in Table 4. The correlation coefficient (R2) from the model indicates that the adsorption data of PSF and PHPSF microspheres are more fitted with the pseudo-second-order model (0.9846-0.9996) rather than pseudo-first-order model (0.9261-0.9812). The k1 calculated from kinetics model indicates that the adsorption speed of PHPSF faster than PSF microspheres. The reason of this phenomenon is that the porous surfaces of the microspheres provide a large specific surface area for more adsorption sites, and the existence of sub-micron pore structure is conducive to the diffusion of solvents [40,41]. Afterwards, the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm adsorption models were used to analyze the single-layer adsorption and heterogeneous multilayer adsorption of MB on the surface of the PHPSF microspheres (Fig. S4). Comparing the correlation coefficients (R2) fitted by the two models (Table 5), it can be seen that the adsorption process of MB on PHPSF is more in line with the Langmuir isotherm adsorption model (9916-0.9977). A monolayer adsorption process dominates the adsorption process of the PHPSF, with an adsorption capacity of 8.49 mg g-1.

Different mass percentages of acetone, including 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% content, were added into ethanol to obtain paired solvents. The nylon substrates spray coated with SFEG were subsequently immerged in the paired solvents for a certain duration to generate mesopores throughout the SFEG layers. The pore sizes as well as thicknesses of the SFEG layers were enlarged with the increase of acetone contents in paired solvents at 70 degC for 5 h, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. The pore sizes of SFEG membranes were enlarged from 15.6 nm to 64.7 nm (Table S1). Few pores were distributed on the surface or cross section of the membranes when the acetone content was 5 wt% or 7 wt% (Fig. 3(a), (e) and Fig. S1). This is because the mobility of PSF chains in such paired solvents was poor and the mobilities of PEG chains were also confined. Selective swelling induced pore generation was not triggered. With the acetone content increased to 10 wt% and 15 wt%, the number of mesopores on the membrane surface was slightly increased and the cross-sectional views of membranes became porous (Fig. 3(b), (f) and Fig. S1) owing to the mobility enhancement of PSF chains at higher acetone percentages. Furthermore, mesopores spread throughout both the surface and cross section of the SFEG layers with the acetone mass content rising up to 20%, 25% and 30% (Fig. 3(c), (d), (g), (h) and Fig. S1).

1008,1008,"Surface chemical grafting [21-23], surface coating [24,25], and modification through blending [26,27] are three common methods to increase membrane hydrophilicity. Surface coating and grafting are often detrimental to membranes, since the increase in hydrophilicity of the membranes surface is only a short-term effect. Blending with hydrophilic materials is therefore the most effective method to solve this problem. The surface hydrophilicity is increased after blending with hydrophilic polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) [28], polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [29,30] or poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) [31]. However, the blended hydrophilic polymers tend to leak from the membranes over time because of their solubility in water. To overcome this problem, amphiphilic copolymers have been introduced as hydrophilic additives to obtain permanent modification [32-35]. Amphiphilic copolymers are comprised of two segments including hydrophobic and hydrophilic chains. The hydrophilic segments migrate to the membrane surface during the phase inversion process, thus forming a hydrophilic antifouling layer. On the other han, the hydrophobic chain anchors to the membrane matrix ensuring a permanent membrane modification [36,37]. Poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO) is an excellent antifouling agent [37-41], but many problems can arise from using PEO materials during the fabrication of membranes by blending, including the leaking of PEO materials over time and the poor compatibility of PEO with membrane matrix materials. In one of our previous studies, amphiphilic copolymers (PES-g-PEO-80, where 80 represents the molar percent of PEO groups) were used to fabricate ultrafiltration membranes, which showed excellent antifouling properties [42]. The use of PES-g-PEO-80 copolymers blended with PSf is an especially convenient method to overcome loss of hydrophilic material and poor polymer compatibility. Compared with linear block amphiphilic copolymers [36,43], the comb-like polymer PES-g-PEO-80 has numerous advantages in PSf membrane modification. First, the unique structure of PES-g-PEO-80 allows the polymer to self-assemble, with the hydrophilic PEO segments enriched on the surfaces of the membrane and the PES backbone firmly embedded in the membrane matrix. Second, the polymer PES-g-PEO-80 can disperse well in PSf casting solution due to the similar backbones. Furthermore, the amphiphilic copolymers PES-g-PEO-80 contain amide groups which could easily be converted to an antibacterial N-chloramine group (Scheme 1), making this material even more attractive. The prescent study has examined the effect of incorporating PES-g-PEO-80 and N-chloramine functional groups with the objective to improve both the antibacterial and antifouling performance of PSf membranes.",383,"Surface chemical grafting [21-23], surface coating [24,25], and modification through blending [26,27] are three common methods to increase membrane hydrophilicity.

However, such approach cannot be applied to prepare stable membranes from chemically less reactive polymers (like e.g. polysulfones (PSUs) or poly(ether ether ketones) (PEEKs)). Therefore, membranes prepared from these kinds of polymers are very often cross-linked by a more drastic treatment like irradiation (e.g. UV, electron beam, or gamma) [15-17]. Apart from that, another strategy involves the synthesis of polymers from these families that carry functional groups [11,16-18]. This polymer is then turned into a membrane, which is later cross-linked by a physical source (e.g. irradiation",n,0.99985474

However, upon addition of 3wt% of PhIn and 5wt% of cross-linker, the macrovoid-like structure became more pronounced (Fig. 4b-f), despite the increased viscosity of the corresponding casting solutions. The membranes with di- to hexa-acrylate cross-linkers had very similar (almost identical) morphologies and were about 20% thicker than the reference membrane. This difference in membrane thickness was probably caused by the much higher viscosity of the casting solutions loaded with cross-linker and PhIn. Generally, increased casting solution viscosities lead to delayed demixing during the phase inversion and result in a more spongy structure without macrovoids [46].

1078,1078,"Hence, recent research has been directed towards introducing SPSf into the membrane to improve the water permeance and hydrophilicity of the membrane [24-26]. The effect of SPSf on the compatibility and performance of PES-based membranes were previously investigated by our group [27]. Results showed that the PES/SPSf blend system was entirely compatible, leading to the PES/SPSf membrane with a high water permeance. In addition, it is known that the strong interaction between water and SPSf can be formed due to hydrogen bonding, which influences the membrane structure and properties. The effect of water content in PES/SPSf polymer solutions on membranes morphology and performance was described in our previous work [28]. Results showed that the macrovoids in the membrane supporting layer were suppressed with the increment of H2O concentration. Moreover, the PES/SPSf membrane possessed superior water permeance and antifouling properties. Though encouraging results were achieved, these works did not elaborate in detail the synergistic effect between SPSf and H2O and how it influenced the membrane structure and performance. In this work, it is hypothesized that the synergy between SPSf and H2O affects the final membrane characteristics by influencing the thermodynamic and phase separation kinetics of the casting solution. On this basis, we can expect that introducing hydrophilic polymer SPSf and non-solvent H2O would result in a robust synergetic or pregelation effect between the two components. Thus, a membrane with desirable structure would be tailored with higher water permeance compared to membrane modified by either SPSf or H2O alone.",247,"Hence, recent research has been directed towards introducing SPSf into the membrane to improve the water permeance and hydrophilicity of the membrane [24-26].

Hence, when the polymer solution immediately came into contact with the water molecules in the non-solvent bath, the -SO3- groups of SPSf polymer chains combined with the water molecules through hydrogen bonding.

It can be observed from Fig. 3 that the surface selection layer thickness of membranes decreased from 88.6 nm (M1) to 61.3 nm (M2) with the addition of H2O. This was because the surface selection layer is the first region to be formed once the casting solution came into contact with the coagulant (H2O). The pre-addition of H2O in the casting solution not only resulted in a decrease in the polymer concentration at the top skin layer of M2, but also decline in membrane formation or double diffusion rate, finally leading to a thinner surface selection layer during the phase inversion process [40,41].

In addition, the surface selection layer of M3 (130.7 nm) was much thicker than that of M1 (88.6 nm). The difference in the membrane microstructure is ascribed to the induction of SPSf during the membrane formation process. That is, the strong affinity of -SO3- groups to H2O cause the decline in the chemical potential between the casting solution and coagulant (water), which was favorable for the coagulant to diffuse into the sublayer, resulting in a membrane (M3) with a thicker surface selection layer [42].",228,"To further compare the difference between the four membranes, Fig. 3 showed the surface selection layer thickness of membranes.

1098,1098,"The introduction of a hydrophilic polymer to the casting solution is a commonly used method to enhance the hydrophilicity of membranes. Generally, the hydrophilic performance of membrane surface is related to the membrane formation behavior, which can be assessed by water contact angle. The water contact angle is mainly determined by the surface chemistry and surface roughness of the membrane [44]. It can be observed from Fig. S1 that there was no significant difference in the surface roughness of the prepared membranes. Hence, the water contact angle of the membranes mainly depended on the surface chemistry. It could be observed in Table 2 that the water contact angle of membrane decreased from 83.1deg (M1) to 72.6deg (M3) with the addition of hydrophilic SPSf to the polymer solution. This was ascribed to PES has larger differences in solubility parameters with DMAc than SPSf. Thus, the PES polymer chains may not fully suspend in the surrounding solvent molecules and would more likely cling to each other. In such circumstances, the PES polymer chains would tend to shrink and solidify faster than SPSf polymer chains during the phase inversion process [20]. Hence, PES polymer chains in the PES/SPSf/DMAc casting solution first solidified into the porous matrix. At the same time, the unsolidified or post-cured SPSf polymer chains segregated at the interface between water bath and polymer solution due to their hydration, leading to -SO3- groups covering the surface of membrane (Fig. 5). Consequently, the hydrophilic performance of the resultant membrane was enhanced with the introduction of SPSf to the polymer solution. Therefore to verify the above observations, the ultrasonic analysis was performed to qualify the mutual diffusion rate of casting solution.",278,"The introduction of a hydrophilic polymer to the casting solution is a commonly used method to enhance the hydrophilicity of membranes.

There are three reasons to justify this improved pure water permeance. Firstly, it can be observed in Fig. 2 that the pore structure within M3 cross-section is more interconnected than that of M1. In other words, the transport resistance for water molecules in M3 is much less than in M1. Secondly, M3 with the addition of SPSf in the casting solution is more hydrophilic in comparison to M1 (Table 2), which would facilitate water molecules to pass through the membrane [45]. Thirdly, the average surface pore size and top surface porosity of M3 is 2.3 nm and 5.8%, respectively, which is larger and higher than those of M1 (1.3 nm and 3.1%), owning to the role of SPSf in promoting nucleation during the phase separation process as mentioned before.

Besides, the rejection of Na2SO4 slightly declined from 4.3% to 0.4%, and the rejection of CR still retained a high value (more than 98%). The decay of M4 permeance for CR/Na2SO4 mixture could be explicated by a decline of the net driving pressure caused by a differential in osmotic pressure between the permeate and retentate streams, particularly in high salt contents, even with the penetration of most salts [50]. In the CR/Na2SO4 mixture, the gradual decrease in the Na2SO4 rejection rate is owning to the enhancement in electrostatic shielding provided by the higher salt concentration, finally bringing about a reduced electrostatic repulsion between Na2SO4 and the membrane surface [51].

The addition of nanofillers can improve membrane performance and properties like antifouling, antibacterial activity, flux, and rejection [8]. Various nanomaterials have been investigated as membrane nanofillers and exhibited high performance such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [9], zeolites [10], metal organic frame works (MOFs) [11], graphene-based materials [12,13], SiO2 [14], MXene [15], TiO2 [16], etc. Among them, graphene oxide (GO) and GO-based materials attracted remarkable research interest in the past few years due to their stability, tuneability, mechanical strength, and easy accessibility [17]. Furthermore, GO-based materials exhibit high fouling resistance and bactericidal effects against various foulants and bacteria making them promising nanofillers to produce high antifouling membranes [18,19]. Additionally, the oxygen content in the functional groups (e.g. hydroxyls, carboxyls, ketones and epoxides) existing on the GO sheets edges enriches GO hydrophilicity and make it a versatile platform for further functionalization to derive other graphene-based materials to meet different purposes [20,21].

1118,1118,"The efficient utilization of nanofillers in membranes fabrication depends on the better interfacial interaction between polymeric matrix and the nanofiller as well as the uniform and stable dispersion in the matrix [23]. However, pristine nanoparticles (e.g. CNTs, GO, etc.) cannot achieve stable and uniform dispersion which limits the efficiency of using them as fillers in some polymer matrices [24]. Therefore, several studies investigated the effect of functionalization on the properties of nanoparticles as well as on the overall membrane performance. Studies reported that a successful functionalization could significantly enhance GO properties to fit different purposes and applications. For example, GO functionalization with hydrophobic materials like octadecylamine (ODA) [25] and n-butylamine (NBA) [26] enhances the performance in membrane distillation (MD) processes where the membrane hydrophobicity is preferable. In contrast, GO functionalization with hydrophilic materials, like polydopamine (PDA) [27], polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) [28], and starch [29], enhances the performance in membrane processes where the hydrophilicity is desirable (e.g. UF, NF, RO, etc.). Several studies have been conducted in literature on the functionalization of GO for different membrane-based water treatment processes including FO, RO, NF and UF. Safarpour et al. [30,31] studied the effect of GO functionalization with TiO2 on RO and NF membranes and reported a clear improvement of fouling resistance. Rajakumaran et al. [32] prepared RO membranes by incorporating amino-functionalized zinc oxide (ZnO) and GO composites (GO-ZnO) into the thin-film-nanocomposite layer (TFN) and reported better antifouling performance compared to pristine membrane. Zhang et al. [33] have recently reported that modifying GO with p-aminophenol enhanced the antibacterial of RO membranes significantly when compared to GORO and pristine RO membranes. Similar studies investigated the effect of GO functionalization with various functional groups on the fouling resistance of UF membranes and showed clear improvement against various foulants. Functional materials used to functionalize GO include isocyanate [34], hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (HPEI) [35], cysteine [36], guanidyl [37], polydopamine (PDA) [27]. Among the various functional groups investigated in the functionalization of GO nanosheets, amines are considered promising agents that can enhance GO properties as well as the overall membrane performance. The amination of GO nanosheets is not novel and was investigated in different studies using various amines. For example, the amination of GO with HPEI could improve the interactions between the nanofiller (e.g. GO-HPEI) and the polymer matrix which enhanced the mechanical properties of polyethersulfone (PES) membrane [35]. In a previous work, we demonstrated that the GO amination with PDA could enhance the flux and the fouling resistance without compromising the rejection performance [27]. Similar observation has been also reported with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS)-aminated GO that showed significant enhancement of the sulfonated-PES performance in terms of flux and organic fouling resistance [38]. Moreover, amine-functionalization of GO nanosheets was found to enhance the membrane's antibacterial activity [35,39]. In this context, dodecylamine (DDA), a cationic surfactant, can be a promising functionalizing agent that enhances GO properties in terms of fouling resistance and antibacterial activity. DDA was previously used to functionalize multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and exhibited ~46 % antifouling enhancement against proteins [40]. Additionally, studies reported that DDA has strong bactericidal effects against several bacteria [41]. DDA can also promote the formation of alkyl group on the edges of GO nanosheets providing better dispersibility of GO in non-polar solvents and a better distribution within the polymer matrix [42]. The higher dispersibility of GO nanosheets in the solvent leads to a better distribution and interactions of GO with the polymer matrix.",569,"The efficient utilization of nanofillers in membranes fabrication depends on the better interfacial interaction between polymeric matrix and the nanofiller as well as the uniform and stable dispersion in the matrix [23].

The graphite oxidation can be confirmed by the presence of different bands related to the oxygenated functional groups in the spectra of pristine GO. These bands were previously reported with GO nanoparticles [43,56]. Fig. 4a confirms also the successful functionalization of GO with DDA by the emergence of different bands. The two bands around 2917 and 2849 cm-1 correspond to C-H stretching vibration [57]. Moreover, the formation of amide-carbonyl bonds between DDA and GO sheets is confirmed by the presence of NH amide bending and CN amide stretching at ~1546 and 1464 cm-1, respectively [58]. The spectra also show that the CO band at ~ 1707 cm-1 was reduced with the rGO-DDA due to the reduction of the oxygen along with the alkyl chain addition to the GO structure [22]. Fig. 4b shows the Raman spectra of the pristine GO and rGO-DDA and confirms the GO formation through the presence of D and G bands, that are characteristic for GO-based materials [43]. It has been reported in various studies that the intensities ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG) is related to the crystallite properties of GO [59,60]. The ID/IG ratio for the pristine GO and rGO-DDA were estimated from the spectra deconvolution and fitting and were found to be 1.8 and 2.1, respectively, indicating an obvious change in the crystallite structure caused by the functionalization reaction with DDA. The increase in the ID/IG ratio can be attributed to the formation of sp3 carbon within the sp2 carbon network of graphene [57].

The Elemental analysis results (Table 2) shows good degree of graphite oxidation represented by the high oxygen content and O/C ratio (50 % and 1.1, respectively). However, the functionalization with DDA reduced the GO oxygen content to 12.3 wt.% and increased C, N and H compositions to 77.4, 3.8 and 6.5 wt.%, respectively, due to the addition of the alkyl chain which agrees with the findings of the FTIR analysis.",362,"The FTIR-UATR spectra of DDA, pristine GO, and rGO-DDA are presented in Fig. 4a.

The pristine GO nanoparticles exhibit clear, sharp and smooth surface, while rGO-DDA showed irregular structure and high roughness. This observation has been reported with different amine-functionalized GO nanoparticles [23,25,61] and can be explained by the intercalation and attachment of DDA molecules between GO sheets. The different morphological structure can be also confirmed by the TEM images shown in Fig. 5b. The pristine GO sheets exhibit wrinkled surface with high transparency indicating a low stacking level and high oxidation degree of GO nanoparticles [43,56]. On the other hand, rGO-DDA exhibits opaque and dense surfaces caused by the GO reduction which cause an increase in the staking level of GO sheets. Similar observations were reported with the functionalization of GO with different amines such as PDA [61], ODA [62], p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and hexamethylene diamine (HMD) [63]. The thermal stability of GO and rGO-DDA nanoparticles was investigated using the TGA analysis. The TGA curves shown in Figure S3 in the supplementary information suggest different thermal stabilities of GO and rGO-DDA nanoparticles which is mainly attributed to the difference of their elemental compositions [43]. The TGA curve of pristine GO shows a slight weight reduction around 100 degC attributed to the evaporation of water molecules between the GO nanosheets. However, no weight loss was observed before 100 degC with rGO-DDA which indicates a hydrophobic nature of rGO-DDA that resists water to be attached to its surface during functionalization. Both GO and rGO-DDA exhibited a major weight loss around 243 degC and 307 degC. The major loss in this temperature range is usually attributed to the thermal degradation of oxygenated functional groups of GO [64]. The oxygenated groups of GO sheets were reduced when functionalized with DDA as revealed by the FTIR and the elemental analysis. Therefore, the major weight loss with rGO-DDA nanoparticles occurred at higher temperature compared to the pristine GO.

The flux decline at high GO concentrations was reported in many studies [35,67,73] and is mainly attributed to the increase in dope solution viscosity [75-77]. As discussed earlier, the increase in viscosity decreases the porosity and the mean pore size and hence decreases the water flux. The filler concentration after which the permeability decreases is generally referred to as the tipping mass percentage that differs depending on the type of polymer and filler [67]. Hence, the findings in this work indicate that the tipping mass percentage of both GO and rGO-DDA is lower than 0.02 wt.%. Further analysis of the PWP results obtained taking into consideration porosity, mean pore size and contact angle measurements shows that PWP decreases as the porosity and pore size decrease regardless the increases in surface hydrophilicity.

The lowest number of bacterial colonies was observed with rGO-DDA-0.15 that exhibited an antibacterial rate of 83.6 %, while the antibacterial rate of GO-0.15 was only 62.9 %. Both GO and DDA have bactericidal activity against various bacteria. The bactericidal activity of GO nanosheets is mainly attributed to two mechanisms. The sharp edges of GO sheets cause a physical disruption and damage of the bacterial cells when contacting GO nanoparticles. Additionally, GO induces the oxidative stress on the bacterial cells due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [55,85]. Some studies have reported that the oxidative stress is the major antibacterial mechanism of GO-based materials and hence GO possesses an antibacterial effect even if there is no direct contact between the bacterial cells and GO edges [86,87]. The GO bactericidal activity is further enhanced when functionalized with DDA due to the amine functionality that assists the electrostatic interactions between the bacteria and GO nanosheets [39]. Therefore, rGO-DDA exhibited a synergetic antibacterial effect against H. aquamarina resulting in a higher bacteriostasis rate. Duan et al. [55] prepared PES UF membranes incorporating graphene oxide immobilized lysozyme (GO-Ly) and reduced graphene oxide (CRGO) and reported antibacterial rate of 68 % and 71 %, respectively. Similar work was conducted by Yu et al. [35] by embedding GO-modified by hyperbranched polyethylenimine (HEPI-GO) into PES and reported a bacteriostasis rate of 74.88 %.",287,"Bacteriostasis rate (BR%) determination is commonly performed to quantitatively evaluate the membranes antibacterial activity [35,55,73]. As depicted in Fig. 15, the number of colonies on the pristine PSF plate indicates no bactericidal effect against H. aquamarina. In contrast, the number of colonies was much lower with GO-0.15 and rGO-DDA-0.15 composite membranes suggesting a clear antibacterial activity of both nanoparticles. The lowest number of bacterial colonies was observed with rGO-DDA-0.15 that exhibited an antibacterial rate of 83.6 %, while the antibacterial rate of GO-0.15 was only 62.9 %. Both GO and DDA have bactericidal activity against various bacteria. The bactericidal activity of GO nanosheets is mainly attributed to two mechanisms. The sharp edges of GO sheets cause a physical disruption and damage of the bacterial cells when contacting GO nanoparticles. Additionally, GO induces the oxidative stress on the bacterial cells due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [55,85]. Some",n,0.99999994
1145,1145,"It is commonly known that the antibacterial activity of a GO-based material is highly dependent on the topography, roughness, wettability and hydrophobicity of the surface [88,89]. Furthermore, the bacterial adsorption on surfaces with moderate hydrophobicity (contact angle of 45-130deg) is stronger than this on hydrophilic surfaces [88-90]. Therefore, the bacterial adsorption on rGO-DDA membranes might be higher than this on GO-based membranes as they have slightly higher hydrophobicity. This implies that DDA increased the adsorption of bacterial cells to GO sheets due to its hydrophobicity along with the amine functionality and hence increased the contact and interactions between them resulting in more physical damage to the microorganisms. Therefore, rGO-DDA-based membranes showed as well as or better antibacterial activity than other GO-based membranes reported in literature. It is worth mentioning that UF membranes are resistant to chlorine that is widely used as disinfectant [2]. However other membrane technologies relying on polyamide materials like RO and NF are not chlorine tolerant, and chlorine must be removed from water before reaching the polyamide membranes. With increasing concerns about chlorine usage in environment and especially the potential formation trihalomethanes which are considered as carcinogenic products, a need to look for alternatives is a vital issue. Developing new membranes with antibacterial properties offers a good alternative to eliminate or reduce using the disinfectants. GO membranes and functionalized GO membranes are offering such an advantage over using the disinfectants especially when used as a pre-treatment process for NF and RO processes.",245,"It is commonly known that the antibacterial activity of a GO-based material is highly dependent on the topography, roughness, wettability and hydrophobicity of the surface [88,89].

With the plasticization of water, both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments of the amphiphilic SPSF nanoparticles could have a strong mobility for rearrangement. With prolonged heating and the water evaporation, the hydrophobic segments between the adjacent nanoparticles in the cluster had hydrophobic segment rearrangements to contact with each other, forming an integrated SPSF layer. Simultaneously, the hydrophilic sulfonic segments had rearrangements in the micro domain (with the property of negatively-charged and nano-sized). On the other hand, with further evaporation of water, the rigidity and stronger interaction of hydrophobic segment, as well as the unchangeable nanoparticle size and shape leaded to the stable domain sulfonic segments.

After 30 min nitrogen charging, the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, and then gradually heated to 152 degC for 8 h under reflux. The water produced by the reaction was removed completely by azeotropic distillation with toluene. Then, the reaction mixture was heated to 175 degC, and started the polymerization for 8 h. After that, the reaction was exposed to air for stopping the reaction, and then cooled to room temperature. The reacted mixture was precipitated into a HCl/methanol aqueous solution (v/v = 2/1) with fully stirring, and then filtrated. Further, the obtained polymer was dissolved in THF, and subsequently re-precipitated into the HCl/methanol aqueous solution for three times. After filtration, the polymer was washed with water at 80 degC for 4 h. Finally, it was dried in a vacuum oven at 90 degC for 24 h to obtain the HO-PSF-OH.

Figs. 4 and 5 show the top surface and the cross-section SEM images of membranes, respectively.It is clear from Fig. 4 that all membranes have a smooth surface, and there are no cracks and big holes on the membrane surfaces. Fig. 5 displays the cross-section morphologies of the membranes, which exhibit the morphology change of the membranes with different composition of casting solution. The cross-section structure of the pristine PSF membrane (M0) consists of a top-densified skin layer, finger-like structure and cellular-like structure in the bottom layer. It can be seen from Fig. 5(b-f) that the cross-section structures of M1-M5 are mainly composed of four parts: a top dense skin structure followed by finger-like pore structure, intermediate macroporous structure, and bottom thin sponge structure. Furthermore, it can be found by observing the microstructures of M1-M5 membranes that, at the same BCP, the thickness of the top skin layer increases with the percentage increase of P4VP-PSF-P4VP, and the size of the finger-like pore also enlarges with P4VP-PSF-P4VP content. These phenomena can be explained as follows: The cross sections of membranes are predominantly occupied by the finger-like pores structure, demonstrating that the instantaneous demixing is still main part of phase separation process. However, compared with the demixing rate of casting solution for M0, those for M1-M5 slow down. With the increase of P4VP-PSF-P4VP percentages in casting solutions, the demixing rate declines to some extent, indicating that the instantaneous demixing would transform to the delayed demixing with increasing the P4VP-PSF-P4VP content (Chen et al., 2016). Thus, a higher P4VP-PSF-P4VP concentration delays the demixing to a larger extent, resulting in producing a thicker top skin layer (Chakrabarty et al., 2008). Due to the existence of the thicker top skin layer, the diffusion rates of the coagulation media and the solvent are limited, which allow longer duration for the polymer-lean phase to grow and coalesce, leading to the formation of larger finger-like pores (Fang et al., 2017). Therefore, it explains why the typical asymmetric membrane structure with a higher P4VP-PSF-P4VP percentage has larger finger-like pores.",371,"Various casting solutions, which were composed of different P4VP-PSF-P4VP and PSF additives, were prepared according to Table 2, and all membranes were formed in deionized water by using the SNIPS method.

Because of the preparation condition ([AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:2000) of the P4VP-PSF-P4VP for M6 and M7, the BCP3 has longer hydrophilic segments, which enhances the thermodynamics stability of the casting solutions (Kumar and Ulbricht, 2013). The hydrophilic segments have a good water tolerant ability, so that the hydrophilic polymer can slowly precipitate out in the coagulating bath, resulting in the delay demixing (Zhu et al., 2017).

The static water contact angle of the pristine polysufone membrane (M0) is relatively higher compared with other membranes, indicating the hydrophobic property of the polysulfone.

It is a good illustration of the hydrophilicity of P4VP segments of the amphiphilic block copolymers which have self-segregated on the membrane surface and pore walls during the phase inversion process, leading to remarkable improved hydrophilic properties of the membranes (Zeng et al., 2019a). The gradually decreasing trend of static water contact angles between M1, M3 and M6 (M1 = 66.5 +- 2.66deg> M3 = 51.1 +- 2.05deg> M6 = 38.9 +- 1.55deg) is due to the change of P4VP content in the P4VP-PSF-P4VP (see Tabs.1 and 2). In addition, as shown in Fig. 7(a), with increasing the P4VP-PSF-P4VP percentages in the casting solutions, the static water contact angles of membranes become smaller at the same BCP, i.e., M2 > M1 at BCP1, M5 > M4 > M3 at BCP2, M7 > M6 at BCP3. It is possible caused by the slower demixing rate at the higher BCP percentages, resulting in more misgration of hydrophilic P4VP segments to the membrane surface (Shen et al., 2017) and thus the decrease of static water contact angle. Moreover, Fig. 7(b) shows the change of dynamic water contact angles of all membranes with increasing time. One can see that the dynamic water contact angles of the blend membranes decline slightly with time. This result can be explained by the existence of the segregated P4VP segments on the membrane surface, permitting water to spread onto the membrane surface and permeate into the membrane matrix slowly (Fang et al., 2017).",341,"Static water contact angles of the prepared membranes are show in Fig. 7(a).

1202,1202,"Pure water fluxes of all prepared membranes at transmembrane pressure of 0.1 MPa are displayed in Fig. 8(a), which is one of the important properties to measure the performance of a separation membrane. The pristine polysulfone membrane (M0) has a very low water flux due to its strong hydrophobicity (Cho et al., 2011). The addition of the amphiphilic block copolymer P4VP-PSF-P4VP greatly improves water fluxes of the blend membranes (M1-M7). These results are in good agreement with the structure characteristics of the blend membranes and their compositions discussed in the previous sections. From the characteristics of SEM, it can be seen that the finger-porous structure and macro-porous structure account for most of the membrane structure. M1 has the highest water flux of 974.1 +- 38.9 L m-2 h-1. It has the porosity up to 77.7 +- 3.88%, and the thickness of the membrane is only 68.2 +- 3.41 mm, so the higher bulk porosity and the thinner membrane thickness (show in Table 3) would offer the lower water diffusion resistance and exceptionally higher pure water flux. Moreover, when the P4VP-PSF-P4VP percentage increases from 50% to 70% for BCP1, the pure water flux of the membrane increases sharply from 103.2 +- 4.12 L m-2 h-1 of M2 to 974.1 +- 38.9 L m-2 h-1of M1. A similar phenomenon also occurs for BCP2, i.e., the pure water flux increases rapidly from 427.5 +- 17.1 L m-2 h-1 of M5 (50% BCP2) to 972.2 +- 38.9 L m-2 h-1 of M3 (70% BCP2). It is possible caused by following reasons: When the content of the P4VP-PSF-P4VP in the casting solution is increased, the hydrophilicity of the membrane increases, and more water-permeable P4VP microdomains are formed in the blend membrane (Chen et al., 2016). Furthermore, the bottom sponge-like layer and membrane thickness all become thinner with the increase of the P4VP-PSF-P4VP content, resulting in the lower water diffusion resistance. Compared with M1 and M3, M6 has the lowest water flux (796.13 +- 31.84 L m-2 h-1) despite their same BCP percentage of 70%. This phenomenon is possible caused by two factors: on the one hand, the trend of hydrophilicity between M1, M3 and M6 gradually increases (see Fig. 7(a)), resulting in the trend of increase of water flux; on the other hand, from Fig. 5, M6 is composed entirely of the dense sponge-like structure which offers a lager transfer resistance than the finger-like structures of M1 and M3, leading to the trend of decrease of water flux. Perhaps the latter is the dominating factor compared with the former, and thus a lower water flux of M6 was observed. In addition, the pure water flux of M7 is higher than that of M6. It can be seen from the cross-section SEM (shown in Fig. 5) that, compared with M6 composed entirely of a sponge structure, M7 comprises the lacy structure at the top layer of the membrane and the macrovoid structure at the bottom layer, which excellently improves its water penetration ability. Furthermore, the effect of transmembrane pressure on pure water flux was measured using M1, M3 and M6 in the transmembrane pressure range of 0.02-0.12 MPa. Fig. 8(b) shows that pure water fluxes of these membranes increase linearly with increasing the pressure. It means that the blend of P4VP-PSF-P4VP and PSF does not weaken the structure of membranes under such pressures (Chen et al., 2016).

1203,1203,"In order to investigate the adsorption capacities of all membrane samples toward Pd (II) ions, the membranes were shaken in Pd (II) solutions at pH 2 for 24 h to reach the adsorption equilibrium. Seen from Fig. 9(a), the pristine polysulfone membrane (M0) has a negligible adsorption capacity towards Pd (II) ions. However, all blend membranes (M1-M7) can adsorb obviously Pd (II) ions at different degree. This can be explained as follows: Because of the lone pair electrons of N atoms on the pyridine in the structure of 4-VP, it can be protonated by H+ ions (Chen et al., 2017). At pH 2, owing to the existence of so many H+ ions, the protonation of the N atom is facile in P4VP-PSF-P4VP macromolecular chain, resulting in the positive charge of the blend membranes. In addition, palladium is usually present in the formation of chloro-anionic species [PdCln](n-2)- in the solutions containing chloride ions (PdCl2 was used, and pH was adjusted by HCl in this work), and [PdCl4]2- anions account for the majority at the low pH (Sayin et al., 2015). The positively charged membranes are effective in neutralizing Pd (II) anions existing in the aqueous solution. Thus, Pd (II) anions are adsorbed onto the membrane surface due to the electrostatic interaction (Fujiwara et al., 2007; Jiang and Kim, 2013), which leads to the adsorption behavior. The adsorption mechanism of the blend membranes towards Pd (II) is shown schematically in Fig. 10. At different BCPs (see Table 2, M1, M3 and M6 were prepared by using different BCPs, i.e., BCP1, BCP2 and BCP3, respectively, under the same percentages and casting conditions), the gradually increasing trend of the adsorption capacity is found between M1, M3 and M6 (i.e., M1 = 9.03 +- 0.45 < M3 = 51.2 +- 2.56 < M6 = 103.1 +- 5.15 mg/g). This phenomenon may be attributed to the different amphiphilic block copolymers. Compared with BCP1 and BCP2, BCP3 has the longest P4VP segments which can provide more binding sites for Pd (II) ions, leading to the increase of adsorption ability. Moreover, at the same BCP, the adsorption capacity of membrane decreases gradually with the decrease of BCP content in the casting solution, as described next: M2 decreases by the adsorption capacity of 7.2 mg/g compared with M1 at BCP1; M5 reduces 21.4 mg/g compared with M3 at BCP2; and M7 drops off 23.7 mg/g compared with M6 at BCP3.

The adsorption capacity sharply increases with increasing pH in the pH range from 0.5 to 2, and reaches a maximum value (103.1 +- 5.15 mg/g) at pH 2, and then decreases when pH increases from 2 to 4. This phenomenon may be explained by the following reasons: At lower pH (such as 0.5), the large excess of Cl- anions from HCl (used for adjusting pH) compete strongly the protonated sites with [PdCl4]2-, leading to the decrease of the adsorption capacity. As the pH increases, the concentration of Cl- in the solution decreases, resulting in the decline of the competition ability of Cl-, and the adsorption of [PdCl4]2-onto the membrane is more favorable. Thus, a higher adsorption capacity is obtained. At higher pH (such as 4), perhaps the decrease of adsorption capacity is due to the existence of less-adsorbable Pd (II) species, such as [PdCl2(H2O)2], [PdCl3(H2O)]-1, [PdCl3(OH)]2-, [PdCl2(OH)2]2-, [PdCl(OH)3]2-, etc. (Wolowicz and Hubicki, 2010).

1208,1208,"There are various anions in the actual wastewaters that may influence the separation performance of the membrane. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of different anions on Pd (II) rejection rate of the membrane. In this work, Cl-, NO3- and [PtCl6]2-, which were provided by NaCl, NaNO3 and K2PtCl6, respectively, were chose as the interfering anions. Fig. 12 shows the effect of Cl-, NO3- or [PtCl6]2- on Pd (II) rejection rate by using M6 during filtration process. As for Cl-, when the concentration of Cl-in the feed increases from 355 to 1355 mg/L, the average rejection rate of Pd (II) decreases from 66.9 +- 3.35% to 61.4 +- 3.07% at filtration time of 90 min. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: the amount of chloride in the solution is the key to form chloro-anionic species of palladium due to the strong interaction between chloride and Pd (II), and a suitable chloride concentration facilitates the formation of [PdCl4]2- (Zhou et al., 2010). However, overmuch chloride anions will compete with [PdCl4]2- for the protonated binding sites on the membrane surface. The competition causes the decrease of palladium rejection rate. As for NO3-, compared with Cl-, NO3- has a smaller influence on palladium rejection performance. The average rejection rate of Pd (II) decreases only from 66.2 +- 3.31% to 64.7 +- 3.19% at filtration time of 90 min as the concentration of NO3- increases from 310 to 1240 mg/L, suggesting that the effect of NO3- is negligible in the concentration range studied. According to the literature (Zhang et al., 2006), NO3- is relatively low for the ability of Pd (II) to form nitrato-complexes. Increasing the concentration of NO3- does not promote Pd (II) adsorption onto the membrane surface; on the contrary, it causes the competition adsorption between NO3- and [PdCl4]2-. Perhaps NO3- has weaker competition ability towards the binding sites compared with Cl-. As for [PtCl6]2-, the average rejection rate of Pd (II) decreases from 86.1 +- 4.31% to 32.4 +- 1.62% at filtration time of 45 min as the concentration of [PtCl6]2- increases from 10 to 40 mg/L, i.e., [PtCl6]2- causes a significant drop in Pd (II) rejection performance of the membrane. The formation of chloro-platinum species decreases the number of available chloride ions for the formation of palladate chloro-anionic species (Zhou et al., 2010). And [PtCl6]2- competes with [PdCl4]2- for the protonated sites.

For the pure water flux, both modified membranes showed noticeably improvement about 118.18% and 27.29% for N2 and D2 membrane, respectively. Such improvement was due to the addition of hydrophilic GA that helped to boost the water permeation across the modified membrane. The affinity of the membrane surface towards water was improved in the presence of GA thus facilitate the water movement across the membrane. One thing worth to mention here was, the usage of green solvent DMSO showed the comparable pure water flux performance with membrane fabricated with conventional solvent without having to compromise the rejection capability. The membrane prepared with DMSO solvent showed better pure water flux for both unmodified and modified membrane and this displayed the potential of DMSO green solvent in replacing the conventional solvent. As for the rejection capability, both modified membranes showed slight improvement as compared to unmodified membrane attributed to addition of negatively charged GA [17]. It is postulated that the membrane surface charge for the modified membrane was tuned into slightly negative and resulted into higher rejection capability for negatively charged particle such as CR in this study. The flux recovery ratio showed one similar pattern whereby modified membrane showed better FRR as compared to unmodified membrane.

1261,1261,"The thicknesses of new MMMs were measured using a micrometer screw gauge and were in the range of 98-115 mm. In addition, their surface and cross-section morphologies were inspected by SEM technique (Figs. 3 and S5, ESI+). Generally, the overall porosity of the membrane surface has significantly increased upon incorporation of PICCSBs into the matrix of PS, as shown in Fig. 3A-C. The surface of the native PS membrane (M0) is smooth and dense with a non-porous texture (Fig. 3A). Whereas, the surfaces of MMM1 and MMM2 are almost homogeneous porous networks with pore diameters (PD) in the ranges of 0.7-1.1 and 0.5-0.8 mm, respectively (Fig. 3B,C). On the other hand, it is evident from the cross-sectional SEM micrographs (Fig. 3D-F) that both MMMs exhibited asymmetric extremely porous micro-void structures with many grooves and chancels on their respective upper layers (Fig. 3E,F), as compared with the parent PS membrane which has a layered structure with very few pores (Fig. 3D). Noteworthy, MMM1 has larger pores (diameters range 2.4-3.5 mm) than those in MMM2 (diameters range 1.1-1.5 mm). The significant enhancement in the membrane porosity upon the incorporation of PICCSBs could be ascribed to their extremely hydrophilic nature that enhances the overall hydrophilicity of the membrane to a great extent. This superior hydrophilicity has promoted the mutual diffusion of the membrane components from the casting solvent (NMP) to the non-solvent phase (coagulation solvent, water), and thus the coagulation time for the membrane will increases. Consequently, this slow coagulation allows longer phase inversion time coupled with a lower rate of segregation of PICCSB from casting medium up to the NMP-water interface, promoting the self-induced pore growth [31].

Noteworthy, MMM1 displayed a lower contact angle (WCA = 45.70deg) than MMM2 (WCA = 50.11deg), indicating that MMM2 has lower hydrophilic characters than MMM1.

As evident from Fig. 5A, the native PS membrane displayed a very low positive z-potential at pH 4, whereas, it is exhibited a negative potential at pH > 4 (isoelectric pH (pl-pH) = 4.25). Therefore, the cationic additives (PICCSBs) could be readily deposited on the negatively-charged outer surface of PS to fabricate mixed-matrix PS membranes (MMMs). This leads to the acquisition of positive charges on the outer surfaces of these MMMs and consequently positive z-potentials. These positive values for z-potentials for MMMs were observed over a broad pH range (4-8) and are attributed to the spreading of quaternary ammonium and pyridinium groups onto the barrier interface of membranes, preventing the absorption of anions onto their surfaces in acidic medium [41]. Interestingly, the z-potentials of the MMM surfaces decreased systematically with an increase of pH of the medium. Moreover, at higher pH values (pH > 8.25) the z-potentials for these membranes became negatively charged. For instance, the z-potential of MMM1 has decreased from +51.2 mV (pH 4) to +8.1 mV (pH 6) and -9.0 (pH 9). These changes may be ascribed to the slight accumulation of anions (OH-, from the alkaline medium; Cl- from quaternary salt) on the surface of the membranes, diminishing their streaming potentials [42,43]. In addition, the deprotonation of salicylidene fragments in PICCSBs under pH > 6, forming phenolate anions [44], may also share in the dramatic decrease of the positive surface potentials to reach negative values at pH > 8, eventually. The isoelectric pH (pl-pH) values were found to be 8.25 and 8.26 for MMM1 and MMM2, respectively.

From Fig. 5A it is evident that the pristine PS membrane shows very low permeability for both pure water and BSA solution as revealed from its ultra-declined PWF (25.82 L/m2 h) and raised BSA rejection (98.6%).

Simultaneously, the water uptake (WU) of the MMMs was sharply increased from 27.23% (M0) to 95.31% (MMM1) and 87.22% (MMM2) after incorporation of PICCSB1 and PICCSB2, respectively, into the matrix of M0. The PS membrane surface potential has switched from negative to positive values, over a broad pH range (4-8), by blending with PICCSBs as revealed from the measured zeta potentials. The pure water flux (PWF) values of PICCSBs-blended membranes were 238.6 L/m2 h and 222.41 L/m2 h for MMM1 and MMM2 which are 9.3-fold and 8.7-fold, respectively, higher than that of the neat PS membrane (M0). Meanwhile, the rejection of the fouling-inducing model (BSA) has declined from 96.61% in the case of M0 to 41.9% and 47.6% for MMM1 and MMM2, respectively, indicating minimized propensity of BSA adsorption on the membrane surface and consequently reduced fouling. These parameters are in accordance with the results of fouling indices (flux recovery ratio (FRR), total (Ft), reversible (Fr), and irreversible (Fir) fouling) of modified membranes. The FRR% has greatly increased for MMMs as compared to M0. In contrary, all types of fouling have remarkably reduced for MMMs in comparison to M0. In addition, the ion-exchange capacity (IEC), as investigated for the nitrate anion, of the PICCSB1-incorporated membrane (MMM1) is ~34% and ~14% higher than that of the native PS membrane (M0) and PICCSB2-supported membrane (MMM2), respectively. In essence, PICCSBs act as excellent membrane-upgrading modifiers for denitrification and wastewater treatment applications. The novelty of this study can be highlighted in the following achievements; (ii) fabrication, for the first time, of dual (ammonium/pyridinium) ionic liquid crosslinking agents for chitosan, to give (poly(ionic) cross-linked chitosan Schiff bases (PICCSBs)), (ii) PICCSBs have effectively acted as synergistic hydrophilicity-modulators, antifouling, and pore-forming/stabilizing additives for a PS ultrafiltration membrane and thus increase its pure water throughput.",467,"New poly(ionic) cross-linked chitosan Schiff bases (PICCSBs) have been successfully synthesized using a facile and straightforward chemical protocol. PICCSBs have been used to improve the main characteristics of PS membrane including hydrophilicity, porosity, permeability, and fouling-resistance, as well as, nitrate uptake. The positively-charged PS-PICCSBs mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) were fabricated by the nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) technique. The results of elemental and spectral analysis as well as SEM-EDX examination confirm the successful fabrication of PICCSBs and MMMs. In general, the main properties of PS membrane (porosity, hydrophilicity, surface charge, and fouling-resistance) have been positively affected and greatly improved after blending with PICCSBs, compared to the native PS membrane.

In the slot die casting method, the slot gap is set at 90 mm, and the coating gap is set at 200 mm above the glass plate substrate, which is placed on top of the poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film. The PET film is the moving conveyor that is pulled at a speed of 1.3 mm/s from a feed roller to the take-up roller [30]. A syringe pump is used to set the flow rate of the dope solution dispensed from the slot die to fabricate defect free membranes. For each batch, approximately 80 mL of dope solution is filled in the syringe. A different 2D flow rate is used for each dope solution, for PSf/DMAc, 0.17 mm2/s is used; for PSf/PolarClean, 0.75 mm2/s is used, and 0.70 mm2/s is used for PSf/50%PolarClean-50%GVL. The different 2D flow rates are used due to the different properties of these dope solutions. All casting is performed at 25 degC and 48% humidity. The glass substrates are cleaned with DI water and are then rinsed using isopropyl alcohol to guarantee no residual water on the surface before casting.

Due to the higher viscosity of PolarClean (9.78 mPa s at 25 degC) in comparison to DMAc (0.92 mPa s at 25 degC), the rotation speed of 300 RPM was not sufficient to fully disperse the polymer in solvent because there was a dead zone observed during mixing.

Since more energy is needed to break down the bond between the PSf chains and the s-CuI filler, the MMMs in general display improvements of mechanical properties. The declining trend in the tensile strength with further increase in s-CuI content to 1.0 wt% probably originates from the weakened affinity between the two phases due to the severer agglomeration of the s-CuI filler.

Therefore, we investigated the antifouling ability of the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane compared with that of the pure PSf membrane. Fig. 7 presents time-dependent flux of both the membranes during UF operation subjected to sequential fouling/washing steps. After the initial operation of deionized water for 2 h, the PWP of the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane drops noticeably from 1384 L/(m2 h bar) to a relatively steady flux of 936 L/(m2 h bar) while the PWP of the pure PSf membrane decreases from 544 L/(m2 h bar) to 328 L/(m2 h bar). Such flux loss is attributable to compaction, where mechanical deformation of the solid polymer occurs under a trans-membrane pressure difference [39]. After sequential fouling/washing steps through BSA solution filtration, the flux recovery ratio (FRR) for the pure PSf membrane and the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane are respectively 54.0% and 52.1% in the first cycle, and respectively 35.1% and 35.7% in the sixth cycle.

1378,1378,"Based on the membrane material, membranes can be classified into ceramic membranes and polymeric membranes. Polymeric membranes have good physical and chemical resistance. Most commercial membrane materials which are used in MBRs are polymeric membranes but are mostly hydrophobic. Polysulfone (PSf) is one the most popular polymers that is commonly used in preparing ultrafiltration membranes due to its special properties like mechanical, chemical and thermal stabilities [6-8]. However, the hydrophobic nature of PSf membrane results in fouling problems and consequently, shortens the membrane lifetime [9,10]. Moreover, membrane biofouling in MBRs is also the main drawback which will lead to severe flux decline, decrease in membrane performance and increase in operational costs. Fouling in MBRs is attributable to suspended particulates microorganisms, colloids, solutes, and sludge flocs. These materials deposit onto the membrane surface and into the membrane pores, clogging the pores, and leading to a decline in the permeability of the membrane [4,11-13]. In order to overcome the membrane fouling in MBR, lots of membrane modification methods have been proposed. Blending with compatible polymers [14], surface modification [15,16] and embedding nanoparticles into the polymer matrices [17-20] are the most common methods used recently. Among all the mentioned techniques, incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric matrices seems to be more convenient [21]. Among different nanoparticles, ND has attracted much attention due to its unique characteristics such as hydrophilic properties, high surface area, hardness, high thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, antibacterial properties and the presence of different functional groups on the surface which makes the functionalization process much more convenient [22-24]. Recent studies suggest that the presence of variety of hydrophilic groups on the surface of the ND nanoparticles may contribute to the improvement of the membrane properties such as water flux, hydrophilicity, and anti-fouling ability. However, nano-sized materials like ND nanoparticles always face the problem of aggregation in the membrane matrix [25].

1402,1402,"Fouling analysis was performed by calculating the reversible fouling ratio (RFR), irreversible fouling ratio (IFR), total fouling ratio (TFR) and flux recovery ratio (FRR) of membranes. The results are reported in Table 5. The lower IFR and higher FRR values represent the better antifouling properties of the membrane. As a matter of fact, IFR is a kind of fouling which is the result of trapping foulant molecules in the membrane pores and surface, and chemical cleaning is needed to remove these foulants [45]. On the other hand, frequent chemical treatment may results in reduction of membrane lifetime. Therefore, in order to minimize chemical cleaning, IFR should always be reduced to the minimum [46]. According to the Table 5, the pure PSf membrane exhibited the highest IFR (71.11%) and lowest FRR (28.89%) and it means not only physical treatment won't be enough for the membranes to be recovered, but also according to the FRR result, the flux recovery performance is so poor. Based on the results reported in Table 5, it also can be concluded that the addition of nanoparticles into the polymeric matrix has caused improvements in antifouling characteristics of membranes. For PSf/ND (1 wt%), the IFR value decreased to 56.25% and the FRR value increased to 43.75% and also for the PSf/SND (1 wt%), the IFR value decreased along with the increase in the FRR compared to the PSf/ND (1 wt%). Actually, the improved anti-fouling properties of the latter membrane can be attributed to improved hydrophilicity and membrane structure which is in accordance with the results of other studies as well [11,47]. The presence of carboxylic groups on the PSf/SND (1 wt%) membrane structure, improved the hydrophilicity property by creating a thin layer of water on the surface of the membrane and it reduced the hydrophobic adsorption of sludge particles [13]. Generally, in aqueous solution like MBR systems, the interaction of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and hydrophilic groups of SND, associated the water molecules around SND, that prevents proteins and other biomolecules and living cells from approaching the surface. It is usually regarded as a steric stabilization effect [48].

The results are reported in Table 5. The lower IFR and higher FRR values represent the better antifouling properties of the membrane. As a matter of fact, IFR is a kind of fouling which is the result of trapping foulant molecules in the membrane pores and surface, and chemical cleaning is needed to remove these foulants [45]. On the other hand, frequent chemical treatment may results in reduction of membrane lifetime. Therefore, in order to minimize chemical cleaning, IFR should always be reduced to the minimum [46]. According to the Table 5, the pure PSf membrane exhibited the highest IFR (71.11%) and lowest FRR (28.89%) and it means not only physical treatment won't be enough for the membranes to be recovered, but also according",n,1.0

1407,1407,"From the literature study, high flux rate of the PSf membrane can be improved via incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles [4]. Some examples of nanoparticles are titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanomaterials, ZnO nanoparticles, silver (Ag) nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene oxide (GO) [17-19]. Among them, ZnO nanoparticles are considered to be a promising metal oxide for PSf membrane modification due to its high hydrophilicity, relatively inexpensive cost and is non-toxic to humans [20,21]. The hydrophilic nature of the ZnO nanoparticles can easily absorb hydroxyl (OH) groups which increases the absorption of water molecules onto the separation layer of membrane [22]. This water-loving characteristic of ZnO nanoparticles is able to increase the overall flux performance of membranes. Antifouling of organic matters by hydrophilic ZnO nanoparticles also adds value for the incorporation of these nanoparticles in mixed matrix membranes. Organic matters are less susceptible to foul on the hydrophilic membranes due to the reduced interactions between the hydrophilic membrane surface with organic matters [23]. Xiong et al. reported ZnO nanoparticles are able to improve hydrophilicity and porosity of the nanocomposite substrate membranes [24]. Amini et al. [25] reported that the contact angle values observed were lower as the ZnO nanoparticles loading increased. Moreover, with increasing amount of ZnO nanoparticles in the membrane matrix, the reverse salt flux of thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes also increased. This can be related to the soluble permeability or hydrophilicity of the membrane. Kusworo et al. [26] found that 1.5 wt% of ZnO nanoparticles increased the hydrophilic property of PES membrane from 68.33deg to 66.17deg. They explained that it's due to the nature of a higher volume of nano-ZnO particles which have a large surface area on the membrane that can adsorb hydrophilic OH and therefore increases the hydrophilicity. Sokhandan et al. [27] reported introduction of hydrophilic agents such as 2.0 wt% of sodium alginate (C6H7O6Na) in 2 wt% ZnO improved the flux from 37 to 51 L/m2 h, porosity from 63.00% to 72.00%, antibacterial nature, higher flux recovery from 33.50% to 74.00% and hydrophilicity from 42.00deg to 28.00deg for sodium alginate coated zinc oxide in Polyacrylonitrile (ZnO@SA/PAN) flat sheet membrane.",353,"From the literature study, high flux rate of the PSf membrane can be improved via incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles [4].

The deposition of these fouling materials on the membrane surface can disrupt the membrane's performance in terms of its permeate flux and rejection rate. Antifouling performance of BHFM1 and BHFM4 in 1000 ppm BSA solution was investigated using cross-flow filtration system in laboratory setup at pressure 1.0 bar. The BHFMs were allowed to filter BSA solution for a complete one circle of filtration for a duration of 240 min and volume of flux (ml) was recorded at 30 min intervals to evaluate the fouling behavior. 10 ml of effluent solution was collected at 30 min intervals to evaluate the rejection rate.,n,1.0

The macro voids and dense sponge structure observed near the braid support are responsible for higher permeation [45]. This was possibly due to the hydrophilic properties of the ZnO nanoparticles which makes the water move faster into the membrane compared to the de-mixing rate between solvent and non-solvent during the phase inversion process [26,45]. In this study the addition of ZnO nanoparticles in the dope solution were believed to delay the de-mixing process between solvent and non-solvent which increased the formation of macro voids. The incorporation of non-solvent material in the dope solution has increased the viscosity, and consequently the kinetic exchange mechanism of the solvent and water in the coagulation bath has become slower. Thus the macro voids structures are formed [46,47]. This mechanism is corresponding to reports by Fan et al., where they detailed that the formation of the macro void pores in the separation layers is due to the transition from delayed de-mixing to instantaneous de-mixing which mainly happens on the addition of non-solvent materials in the dope solution [35].",253,"BHFM2 and BHFM3 exhibits wider finger-like structures with dense skin layer at its outer selective layers, macrovoids and sponge structures underneath the selective layer and a small amount of PSf coating solution which infiltrated into the braid support.

1424,1424,"From the morphology of the BHFMs, it can be clearly observed that the infiltration of the dope solution was promoted with the introduction of the ZnO nanoparticles. This is due to the hydrophilic property of the doping solution which can easily infiltrate the braid support and accumulate in-between the braid channels during the fabrication process [48]. This infiltration of small amounts of dope solution into braid supports as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (f) promotes a good interfacial bond between the separation layer and braid support. Cheng et al. reported that the intrusion of the dope solution into the braid support increased the mechanical stability of the braided membranes [32]. This is due to the separation layer being tightly bonded with the braids, preventing the delamination of the separation layer from the braid support. Table 4 illustrates the thickness of the separation layer, outer diameter and inner diameter of the fabricated HFM and BHFMs. From the measured thickness of BHFMs, it can be observed that BHFM1 has a thicker separation layer compared to the other BHFMs. Again, this is due to lower infiltration rate of PSf dope solution compared to ZnO/PSf dope solution. Moreover, different thicknesses of separation layer were observed in all BHFMs. This is also closely related to the infiltration rate of the dope solution into the braid support, and the uneven round shape of the braid support during the spinning process due to mechanical stress applied to pull the braid support out from spinneret system. These results correspond to the result obtained by Liu et al. [34]. They explained that this uneven separation layer thickness is due to the pulling force applied during the fabrication of BHFMs, which change the density of braid support and position or angle of the braid in spinneret. Therefore, the infiltration rate of the dope solution into the braid support is not uniform.",311,"From the morphology of the BHFMs, it can be clearly observed that the infiltration of the dope solution was promoted with the introduction of the ZnO nanoparticles.

1426,1426,"The tensile stress of the braid support and best-performing membrane BHFM4 were measured, and the stress-strain data are plotted as shown in Fig. 5. The braid support and BHFM4 exhibited super-high tensile stress at break 118.127 MPa and 85.501 MPa respectively. It can clearly be seen that the tensile strength and elongation at break of the BHFM membrane is less compared to the braid support. The lower mechanical strength of the BHFM is due to the alkaline pre-treatment of the braid support. The obtained tensile strength of both braid support and BHFM are corresponding with results reported by Zhou et al., Quan et al., and Liu et al., where they reported the tensile strength of braided membranes are from 80 MPa to 160 MPa [44,48,52-54]. The obtained tensile stress of BHFM is 4 times higher as compared self-supporting HFM which are typically from 2 MPa to 22 MPa [44,55,56]. The membrane mechanical strength is one of factors which is limiting its applications in wastewater treatment systems. Based on the tensile test result, the BHFMs could be an effective membrane in high-pressure wastewater treatment systems. Based on the other research's findings, the mechanical strength of the braided membranes is dependent on the mechanical strength of the selected braid support rather than the mechanical strength of the coating layers [1,48,52,54]. Along with this, we also can observe that the elongation of the braided membrane is lower than the braid support; which is 26.910% and 35.815% for BHFM4 and braid support respectively. This is due to the formed coating layer and infiltrated separation layers in the braid support limiting the deformation of the braid, and inhibiting the straining of the braided membrane. Many research studies claims high tensile stress of braided membranes; however, they also placed their concern on the delamination of the coating layers which related to the poor interfacial bonding strength between separation layer and braid surface. The poor interfacial bonding between coating layer and braid support could restrict the lifetime of the membranes [36,44].",334,"The tensile stress of the braid support and best-performing membrane BHFM4 were measured, and the stress-strain data are plotted as shown in Fig. 5.

The content of nisin in the membranes was estimated by measuring the weight change of the membranes as a function of immersion time (Fig. 3). Membranes containing larger PDMA contents show larger bonding density values. Moreover, the increase of the bonding density was observed with increasing the immersion time as expected. For example, larger increase was also observed for the AP-DM#-N5 membrane treated with the larger nisin concentration. Since reasonably large bonding density values (high content of nisin) are observed after 6 h of immersion time, all the membrane tests were performed using the membranes prepared with 6 h of immersion time.

The thicknesses of the membranes were found to be quite close because all the membranes were casted using a doctor blade having the same thickness. The average pore diameter values of the membranes were found to be smaller than 50 nm indicating that they are UF membranes. Among the membranes, AP-DM1 membrane has larger pores than the PSf membrane because a large amount of hydrophilic PDMA moiety is included in the AP-DM1 structure; the increase of the hydrophilicity of the polymer casting solution can increase the exchange rate of solvent (NMP) with non-solvent (DI water) during the NIPS process, thus larger pores can be produced [37-39]. Additionally, PDMA homopolymer in the casting solution, produced during the polymerization (reaction) process in Scheme 2(a), can act as a pore forming agent during the phase separation process because their hydrophilicity can enhance the precipitation rate [40]. Therefore, as the content of hydrophilic DMA increases, the average pore diameter increases from 16.8 nm for AP-DM0.6 membrane to 23.2 nm for AP-DM1 membrane. Meanwhile, it is also well-known that the concentration increase of the casting solution decreases the average pore diameter in the NIPS process because the solvent/non-solvent exchange-rate decreases [41,42]. Since the concentration of casting solution for the AP-DM0.6 and AP-DM0.8 membranes (0.7 and 0.8 mM, respectively) is larger than that for the PSf membrane (0.3 mM), smaller pores were observed for the AP-DM0.6 and AP-DM0.8 membranes.

It is clearly observed that both of the AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes that have higher contents of PDMA moieties have better antifouling properties against biofoulant. Since the hydrogen bonding network of the catechol groups in polydopamine and water molecules provides an energetic and steric-entropic barrier against the adhesion of biofoulants on the membrane surface in an aqueous environment [17,41,42,45,46], the membranes with higher contents of PDMA moieties can have better fouling resistance. The effect of nisin and PDMA contents on the DR values of the membranes is summarized in Fig. 8(a). After 60 min of the dead-end filtration test, the membranes were washed with DI water and then the water flux of the membranes measured again. The flux recovery ability of the membranes was evaluated by calculating flux recovery ratio (FRR, %) as shown in Fig. 8(a). The FRR values of AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes are larger than that of the PSf membrane, and the values found to increase with the increase of the DMA content and the decrease of the nisin content because proteins such as BSA attached on the surface of the membrane containing larger content of hydrophilic moieties can be easily washed out through the rinsing process using DI water [9].",348,"The fouling resistance and flux recovery ability of AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes were investigated through the dead-end filtration test using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model biofoulant. Fig. 7 shows the normalized flux variations and flux recovery abilities of the membranes. Since biofoulants can be easily attached on the hydrophobic membrane surfaces [5,6,10-13], the PSf membrane shows large flux decrease at the initial filtration step and about 44% flux decline is observed after 60 min of BSA solution filtration. In contrast, AP-DM#-N1 membranes exhibit linear flux decrease and the flux decline ratios (DR, %) of the membranes after 60 min of the filtration are smaller than 25%. AP-DM#-N5 membranes show slightly larger DR values than the corresponding AP-DM#-N1 membranes because nisin is less hydrophilic than DMA (Fig. 6(b)).

1533,1533,"In order to maintain the filtration performance of membrane in practical industrial applications, the antimicrobial property is important in addition to the fouling resistance. It has been reported that bacteria attached to membranes can produce a biofilm causing membrane flux decline when the population of the bacterial on the membrane is larger than a certain concentration (i.e., quorum sensing effect) [17,47,48]. The antimicrobial properties of the membranes were evaluated against model Gram-positive (S. aureus, ATCC 6537) bacteria by a shaking flask method to confirm the bactericidal effect of the nisin content on the membrane surface. Fig. 9(a) and (b) show the results of antibacterial tests of the membranes and the bacterial inhibition rate of the membranes calculated by Eq. (5), respectively. AP-DM#-N5 membranes show excellent bactericidal activity: the bacterial inhibition rates of AP-DM0.6-N5, AP-DM0.8-N5, and AP-DM1-N5 membranes are 85.9, 89.7, and 92.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, AP-DM#-N1 membranes show relatively lower bacterial inhibition rate than AP-DM#-N5 membranes, and the values are smaller than 83% (7.5, 34.0 and 83.0% for AP-DM0.6-N1, AP-DM0.8-N1 and AP-DM1-N1, respectively). As expected, the increase in the nisin content on the membrane surface increases the antimicrobial properties of the membranes. In addition, when comparing the bacterial inhibition rate of the membranes having the same amount of PDMA, such as AP-DM0.6-N1 vs AP-DM0.6-N5, the rate ratios of AP-DM#-N5 membranes are always larger than those of the corresponding AP-DM#-N1 membranes. This result indicates that the antimicrobial properties of the membranes are mainly determined by the concentration of nisin solution during the immobilization process rather than the amount of PDMA moiety on the membrane surface. Fig. 9(c) summarizes the flux decline ratio and bacterial inhibition rate of the AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes. The AP-DM0.8-N5 membrane exhibits the best performance in terms of having excellent antibacterial activity with reasonably good antifouling property because it contains an appropriate amount of the hydrophilic PDMA moiety and the antimicrobial nisin moiety.",315,"In order to maintain the filtration performance of membrane in practical industrial applications, the antimicrobial property is important in addition to the fouling resistance.
