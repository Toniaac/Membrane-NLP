       "                  The non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process applied to polysulfone (PSf) casting solutions traditionally leads to the formation of membranes decorated with large macrovoids in their cross-section on top of which lies a dense skin offering a significant resistance to flow. Macrovoids, are considered weak points. They are prone to compaction leading to poor filtration performance over time. Here, we used 2-pyrrolidone (2P) to prepare skin-free PSf membranes by NIPS, and studied the effect of water as an additive to help suppress the formation of macrovoids. The surface images showed the presence of multiple pores while the cross-section images exhibited the successful suppression of macrovoids. The latter was attributed to the enhancement of the solution viscosity causing the mass transfer kinetics to be slowed down, consequently affecting the demixing rates. Moreover, the rheological behavior of the casting solutions revealed that high degree of chain entanglement helped mitigate macrovoid formation. Using 2P as the solvent for PSf permitted the retention of interconnected pores from the top surface, due to the high viscosity of the solution which prevented coarsening. The high porosity (&gt;75%) and large pores (&gt;0.3 μm) of the PSf membranes were still maintained. The permeability of membranes was maintained after suppressing the macrovoids but their mechanical attributes were improved. The feasibility of utilizing water to eliminate macrovoid growth was further validated when applied to other PSf/solvent systems which showed similar trends in the SEM images. These results imply that water as a casting solution additive can provide a highly cost-effective and simple strategy to obtain macrovoid-free p olysulfone membranes.\n",

       "<ce:simple-para id=\"abspara0010\" view=\"all\">The non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process applied to polysulfone (PSf) casting solutions traditionally leads to the formation of membranes decorated with large macrovoids in their cross-section on top of which lies a dense skin offering a significant resistance to flow. Macrovoids, are considered weak points. They are prone to compaction leading to poor filtration performance over time. Here, we used 2-pyrrolidone (2P) to prepare skin-free PSf membranes by NIPS, and studied the effect of water as an additive to help suppress the formation of macrovoids. The surface images showed the presence of multiple pores while the cross-section images exhibited the successful suppression of macrovoids. The latter was attributed to the enhancement of the solution viscosity causing the mass transfer kinetics to be slowed down, consequently affecting the demixing rates. Moreover, the rheological behavior of the casting solutions revealed that high degree of chain entanglement helped mitigate macrovoid formation. Using 2P as the solvent for PSf permitted the retention of interconnected pores from the top surface, due to the high viscosity of the solution which prevented coarsening. The high porosity (&gt;75%) and large pores (&gt;0.3 μm) of the PSf membranes were still maintained. The permeability of membranes was maintained after suppressing the macrovoids but their mechanical attributes were improved. The feasibility of utilizing water to eliminate macrovoid growth was further validated when applied to other PSf/solvent systems which showed similar trends in the SEM images. These results imply that water as a casting solution additive can provide a highly cost-effective and simple strategy to obtain macrovoid-free p olysulfone membranes.</ce:simple-para>\n",

Due to these, NIPS process has been regarded as the most widely-used approach in fabricating flat sheet membranes from a variety of polymers [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0075\" refid=\"bib4\">4</ce:cross-ref>]. In addition, NIPS can provide a wide-range of pore size: from microfiltration to nanofiltration [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0080\" refid=\"bib5\">5</ce:cross-ref>]. In this process, a polymer of choice is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Once homogeneous, the polymeric solution is cast onto a support and phase-inversion is prompted through direct immersion in a coagulation bath/non-solvent bath (typically water), generating a polymer rich phase that transforms into the membrane matrix after polymer precipitation, and a polymer lean phase which develops into pores after demixing [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0085\" refid=\"bib6\">6</ce:cross-ref>].</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0040\" view=\"all\">Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is amongst the most extensively used commercial membranes due to its favorable attributes such as high glass transition temperature (T<ce:inf loc=\"post\">g</ce:inf> = 190 °C), high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance over a wide-range of pH, good thermal resistance, exceptional biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0015\" refid=\"bib7 bib8 bib9\">7–9</ce:cross-refs>]. PSf membranes are commonly used in wastewater treatment [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0020\" refid=\"bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14\">10–14</ce:cross-refs>], hemodialysis [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0025\" refid=\"bib15 bib16 bib17\">15–17</ce:cross-refs>], protein purification [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0030\" refid=\"bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22\">18–22</ce:cross-refs>], food processing [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0090\" refid=\"bib23\">23</ce:cross-ref>], and so on. Polar solvents like <ce:italic>N</ce:italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0095\" refid=\"bib1\">1</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0035\" refid=\"bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27\">24–27</ce:cross-refs>], <ce:italic>N,N</ce:italic>-dimethylformamide (DMF) [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0100\" refid=\"bib9\">9</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0040\" refid=\"bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31\">28–31</ce:cross-refs>], and <ce:italic>N,N</ce:italic>-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0045\" refid=\"bib32 bib33 bib34 bib35\">32–35</ce:cross-refs>] are usually used to dissolved PSf polymers. Utilizing these solvents to prepare PSf membranes via NIPS process generally leads to formation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with relatively dense surface structure and porous sub-structure. Meanwhile, the cross-section of these membranes is composed of large macrovoids with walls having cellular-like structure [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0105\" refid=\"bib36\">36</ce:cross-ref>] which could generate low flux due to the closed-pore structure (the pores are not interconnected with each other) that could potentially slow down the flow of water across the membrane. Additionally, concerns have been expressed on the use of such solvents to prepare polymeric membranes due to their toxicity which can cause adverse effects to our health. Besides, during NIPS process, these solvents are released into the coagulation bath during the membrane formation, and residual solvents are further extracted in the washing bath. These constitute to the release of 20–50 billion liters of contaminated water annually [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0110\" refid=\"bib1\">1</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0115\" refid=\"bib37\">37</ce:cross-ref>], and if not properly treated, can create immense damages to the environment. Hence, the use of these solvents in industries are now strictly regulated. In May 2020, the European Union has imposed a mandate on the use of NMP which has led researchers to find “greener” and more sustainable solvents [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0120\" refid=\"bib24\">24</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0125\" refid=\"bib37\">37</ce:cross-ref>] that have high affinity towards the PSf polymer.

       "<ce:para id=\"p0045\" view=\"all\">As a result of the raising interest to improve the sustainability of PSf membrane production, several different solvents have been investigated in the past with respect to their suitability for replacing harmful solvents. In recent studies conducted by Kahrs and Schwellenbach [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0130\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>], Wang et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0135\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0140\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>], Mousavi and Zadhoush [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0145\" refid=\"bib41\">41</ce:cross-ref>], and Mousavi et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0150\" refid=\"bib42\">42</ce:cross-ref>] the use of utilizing 2-pyrrolidone (2P) solvent as a substitute for NMP was explored. 2P is an organic compound derived from γ-butyrolactone with considerable similarities with NMP as shown in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0155\" refid=\"tbl1\">Table 1</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"tbl1\"/>. To date, there are no known life-threatening risks accompanied by using 2P, making it a potential alternative for NMP.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0050\" view=\"all\">Standard NIPS process yield skinned asymmetric membranes with large macrovoids that could either have closed pore (cellular) structure or interconnected open pore (bi-continuous structure) [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0160\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0165\" refid=\"bib43\">43</ce:cross-ref>]. Macrovoids are defects that grow perpendicular or near perpendicular to the skin or top layer [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0170\" refid=\"bib44\">44</ce:cross-ref>]. They are large in size, and have elongated or teardrop-shaped pores ranging from 10 to 50 μm [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0175\" refid=\"bib45\">45</ce:cross-ref>]. The presence of these large macrovoids can weaken the structural integrity of the membranes which can lead to breakage and total failure during operation [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0180\" refid=\"bib46\">46</ce:cross-ref>]. Since the first development of phase-inversion process by Leob and Sourirajan in the 1960's [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0185\" refid=\"bib47\">47</ce:cross-ref>], macrovoid formation have confounded researchers which has led to the development of different studies to understand macrovoid formation [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0190\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0195\" refid=\"bib44\">44</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0200\" refid=\"bib48\">48</ce:cross-ref>]. Numerous models were proposed for the formation of macrovoids. Early on, Reuvers and Smolders suggested that macrovoids were formed as the result of the nucleation of the polymer poor phase [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0205\" refid=\"bib49\">49</ce:cross-ref>]. Strathmann et al. explained that the macrovoid was initiated by the rupture of the polymeric skin caused by shrinkage stress-induced-syneresis [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0210\" refid=\"bib50\">50</ce:cross-ref>]. Other researchers considered that macrovoid formation stemmed from the thermodynamics aspects of chemical potential gradient [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0215\" refid=\"bib43\">43</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0050\" refid=\"bib51 bib52 bib53\">51–53</ce:cross-refs>]. Additional theories include Marangoni effects [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0220\" refid=\"bib54\">54</ce:cross-ref>], solutocapillary convection mechanism [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0055\" refid=\"bib55 bib56 bib57\">55–57</ce:cross-refs>], osmotic pressure [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0225\" refid=\"bib58\">58</ce:cross-ref>] and combination of different mechanisms [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0230\" refid=\"bib59\">59</ce:cross-ref>]. Nonetheless, several methods have been investigated to reduce macrovoid formation during immersion precipitation due to their weak mechanical strength. These include (i) choosing a solvent and non-solvent pair with low affinity towards each other; (ii) increasing the viscosity of the casting solution by increasing the polymer concentration or adding additives; and (iii) adding solvent to the coagulation bath [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0235\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0240\" refid=\"bib43\">43</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0060\" refid=\"bib60 bib61 bib62\">60–62</ce:cross-refs>].</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0055\" view=\"all\">Although adding solvent to the coagulation bath seem to be the easiest option however, this could lead to increased production costs and pollution. The addition of additives has been the most explored strategies to mitigate the growth of macrovoids, and adding amounts of hydrophilic polymers such polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most predominant [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0065\" refid=\"bib63 bib64 bib65\">63–65</ce:cross-refs>]. Some studies revealed that the addition of these hydrophilic polymers can enlarge the size of the macrovoids, while other studies reported the opposite as highlighted in the study by Sadrzadeh and Bhattacharjee [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0245\" refid=\"bib64\">64</ce:cross-ref>]. These inconsistencies could be due to the fact that PVP and PEG are originally utilized as pore formers for polymeric membranes. They form pores as they leach out of the cast film upon immersion in the coagulation bath. However, depending on the molecular weights of the PVP and PEG [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0250\" refid=\"bib64\">64</ce:cross-ref>], some can get trapped in the polymeric matrix. Therefore, the molecular weights of these materials have to be taken into great considerations before being used to suppress macrovoids. On the other hand, other researchers have used non-solvents such as water [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0255\" refid=\"bib24\">24</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0260\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0265\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0270\" refid=\"bib66\">66</ce:cross-ref>], ethanol [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0275\" refid=\"bib65\">65</ce:cross-ref>] and other organic solvents [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0280\" refid=\"bib66\">66</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0285\" refid=\"bib67\">67</ce:cross-ref>] to control the exchange rates of the solvent and coagulant. Among these, water appear to be the most logical option due to its accessibility, abundancy, low-cost, and non-toxicity.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0060\" view=\"all\">As of this writing, there are only 4 published works on PSf/2P system. Mousavi and colleagues intensively worked on the dynamics of using 2P as a sole solvent for PSf, and a co-solvent, and how the rheology of these conditions contributed to the resulting cross-section structure of PSf membranes [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0290\" refid=\"bib41\">41</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0295\" refid=\"bib42\">42</ce:cross-ref>]. Since standard NIPS process produce ultrafiltration PSf membrane, Wang et al. in their earlier work [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0300\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>], explored the use of vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process to obtain PSf membranes with highly porous surface and cross-section. Recently, Wang and colleagues observed the macrovoid initiation position in PSf/2P system prepared by NIPS process [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0305\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>]. These previous works have provided initial understanding on the solvency of PSf in 2P, and on how the viscoelasticity of the casting solution affects the cross-section of PSf membranes. It is important to note that, except for the work on PSf/2P using VIPS process, the other studies only focused on the morphology of the cross-section of PSf membranes, specifically on the growth of macrovoids.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0065\" view=\"all\">This study encompasses two major objectives: (i) fabrication of highly porous PSf membranes through NIPS process using 2P as the solvent, and (ii) the suppression of macrovoid growth by using water as a non-solvent additive in the PSf/2P casting solution. Although, other studies [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0310\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0315\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>] have previously explored the feasibility of this concept, they have not fully determined the amount of water that can be added to achieve macrovoid-free PSf membranes. Moreover, in this study, in-depth evaluations of the physical properties such morphology, porosity, pore size, permeability, and mechanical property of the PSf membranes with respect to the concentration of the additive are thoroughly carried out. <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0320\" refid=\"fig1\">Fig. 1</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig1\"/> shows the three major parts of this study. The first part, heavily revolves on trying to understand how the nature of solvency of 2P affects the morphology of the PSf membranes, and its viability as a replacement for NMP solvent. Next, once the fundamental concepts of 2P/PSf system are established, the use of water as an additive in the casting solution to suppress macrovoids is examined. Herein, we shall probe into the viscosity of the solution, study the ternary diagram, and investigate the kinetics that took place during phase-inversion. In addition, comprehensive analysis of the physical properties of the membranes such as porosity, pore size, morphology, permeability, and mechanical properties will be examined. Lastly, the potential application of this concept will also be extended to other systems such as PSf/NMP, PSf/DMAc, and PSf/DMF to test the practicality of using water to suppress macrovoids.</ce:para>\n",

As shown in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0425\" refid=\"tbl2\">Tables 2</ce:cross-ref> and 2P is a poorer solvent than NMP therefore, the homogeneous region of PSf/2P/water phase diagram is narrower than PSf/NMP/water. This indicates that it would take less amount of non-solvent (water) to induce demixing in PSf/2P system. The cloud points in <ce:cross-ref id=\"opttY2c98rcbu\" refid=\"fig2\">Fig. 2</ce:cross-ref> denoted the amount of water needed to demix the system. For PSf/2P system, it takes about 2 wt% of water to phase separate the solution, and as the amount of PSf in the solution is increased, it takes a lesser amount of non-solvent to induce phase-inversion. With this knowledge, we can identify how much non-solvent additive we can add into the casting solution without causing phase-inversion. Another key parameter that must be considered is the relative energy difference (RED) which provides information on whether the parameters of the two molecules (usually a polymer and solvent) are within range. This can be measured according to the following equations [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0430\" refid=\"bib2\">2</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0435\" refid=\"bib77\">77</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0440\" refid=\"bib78\">78</ce:cross-ref>]:<ce:display>\n",

Left-hand figure displays the surface and cross-section morphology of the PSf membrane when NMP was used as a solvent, while the right-hand figure represents the PSf/2P system. Starting with the PSf/NMP system, a dense surface structure was obtained which is consistent with other published works [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0455\" refid=\"bib1\">1</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0070\" refid=\"bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27\">24–27</ce:cross-refs>] while, a skinned asymmetric membrane with large finger-like macrovoids extending from the top part to the bottom part of the membranes with walls having cellular-like structure was obtained.

Meanwhile, it appears that the macrovoids were found at the deeper part of the membrane. Zoomed-in images of the membrane reveal that instead of cellular-like structure, 2P solvent generated interconnected pores or bi-continuous structure which is in agreement with the previous studies by Wang et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0460\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0465\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>] when 2P is used as a solvent.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0200\" view=\"all\">Although there are numerous studies tackling phase-inversion of casting solution to form membranes, the concept governing demixing is still tricky to understand. Many studies have suggested that if a solvent has a high affinity or high miscibility with the non-solvent, instantaneous demixing would occur. In other words, the fast exchange between the solvent and non-solvent induces the rapid precipitation of the polymer and formation of the film, within seconds of immersion in the coagulation or non-solvent bath. With this type of demixing, a highly porous cross-section (finger-like macrovoids) is obtained. On the other hand, if the solvent has a low affinity towards the non-solvent, a slow exchange occurs, which decelerates the formation of the film. Membranes with relatively dense top layer and sponge-like substructure are achieved during delayed demixing [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0470\" refid=\"bib4\">4</ce:cross-ref>]. However, other studies suggest that instantaneous demixing can help mitigate the formation of macrovoids [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0475\" refid=\"bib79\">79</ce:cross-ref>]. With these ambiguities in membrane formation, Hong et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0480\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>] studied the demixing that transpires during phase separation process.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0205\" view=\"all\">A homogeneous casting solution can be demixed through nucleation and growth (NG) or spinodal decomposition (SD) depending on the solution composition at which the phase separation occurs [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0485\" refid=\"bib80\">80</ce:cross-ref>]. For the demixing to occur via NG, the phase separation composition must lie on the meta-stable or binodal region. Conversely, for SD to happen, the composition path must be found in the unstable or spinodal region. When phase-inversion happens via NG, the resulting morphology consists of nuclei of polymer-poor phase that can grow into macrovoids. Meanwhile, when phase-inversion occurs via SD, the subsequent morphology contains continuous polymer-poor phase but not nuclei type. If the demixing is accompanied by fast solvent and non-solvent exchange, the phase-inversion would typically be via SD, as evidenced by the formation of bi-continuous structure [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0490\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>].</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0210\" view=\"all\">It was previously stated that NMP has a high affinity towards water hence, one would assume that the exchange of solvent and non-solvent is fast enough to cause SD demixing. However, this claim contradicts our observations in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0495\" refid=\"fig3\">Fig. 3</ce:cross-ref>, as cellular-like structures are observed instead of bi-continuous morphology. Meanwhile, 2P has a low miscibility towards water (possible cyclic dimer), so it is expected that phase-inversion would transpire via NG, and poorly interconnected pores on the walls of the macrovoids are to be anticipated. However, the opposite was found on both membranes. To find out why such phenomena were observed, we evaluated the viscosity of both systems as illustrated at the bottom images of <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0500\" refid=\"fig3\">Fig. 3</ce:cross-ref>. Due to the poorer solvency of PSf in 2P, higher viscosity is attained. For the same concentration (15 wt%), PSf/2P system has 41% higher viscosity than PSf/NMP system. This suggest that the high viscosity of PSf/2P system slowed down the solvent and non-solvent exchange which helped maintain the open porous structure and interconnected pores by mitigating the coarsening process. Conversely, NMP is a good solvent for PSf. Its high affinity for water permitted fast solvent and non-solvent exchanges, while the low viscosity (553 cP) of the system could not prevent coarsening during the phase-inversion process. So, phase-inversion may occur by SD, but the structure is not fixed and can still evolve after phase-separation. As a result, large macrovoids were observed across the membrane with cellular-like structure.</ce:para>\n",

       "<ce:para id=\"p0215\" view=\"all\">As stated previously, earlier works did not explore the effect of 2P on the surface morphology of PSf membranes via NIPS process. In this study, we found out that by using 2P as solvent, we could easily obtain PSf membranes in the MF range. Normally, NIPS process generates ultrafiltration membranes as a result of the fast solvent and non-solvent exchange that transpires in the coagulation bath which typically results in the formation of a relatively dense top surface also known as skin layer [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0505\" refid=\"bib49\">49</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0075\" refid=\"bib81 bib82 bib83 bib84\">81–84</ce:cross-refs>]. Based on the study conducted by Strathmann, asymmetric morphology arises from the steep concentration, and activity gradient of the polymer, solvent and non-solvent. If the affinity of the solvent and non-solvent towards each other is high, as soon as the water is introduced on the surface of the film, the resulting chemical composition at the interface reaches in a short time a value indicating a phase separation has occurred, due to the fast mass transfer kinetics between the solvent and non-solvent. Where in fact, the internal of the film is still very far below the binodal point [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0510\" refid=\"bib85\">85</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0515\" refid=\"bib86\">86</ce:cross-ref>]. In order to slow down the exchange at the interface, additives can be introduced into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. That is why researchers commonly incorporate additives such as PEG or PVP to obtain PSf MF. To obtain PSf MF membranes, additives such PEG or PVP are added into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. However, even without additives, PSf/2P system is viscous enough (compared to PSf/NMP) to allow slower mass transfer kinetics during phase-inversion which permitted the formation of porous surface structure as shown in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0520\" refid=\"fig4\">Fig. 4</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig4\"/>. But it is important to note that the amount of solid content would also influence the viscosity of the solution which could decrease the porosity of the membrane. Hence, it is evident in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0525\" refid=\"fig4\">Fig. 4</ce:cross-ref> that the surface porosity decreases with the polysulfone content (which will be verified later by dedicated measurements).</ce:para>\n",

       "<ce:para id=\"p0225\" view=\"all\">In the introduction, we have stated the different ways to suppress macrovoid growth in polymeric membranes. Among these different approaches, adding additives into the casting solution seem to be the easiest and most economical. PVP, PEG, non-solvent, etc., are some of the most used additives to mitigate macrovoid growth. In this study, we chose water as the additive because of its abundancy and availability, cost-effectiveness, and it will not be trapped in the polymer domain (unlike polymeric additives) during the phase-inversion process. <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0530\" refid=\"fig5\">Fig. 5</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig5\"/> shows the entire cross-section of the different membranes prepared: P8, P10, P12, and P15 which consist of 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf in 2P, respectively. The amount of water added into the casting solution was dependent on the cloud point evaluation from <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0535\" refid=\"fig2\">Fig. 2</ce:cross-ref>, that is to avoid phase-separation of the casting solution. For P8, the amount of DI water was varied from 0 to 1.5 wt%. Meanwhile, for P10 and P12, 0–1.0 wt% of water was added. Lastly, for P12, the concentration of DI water was from 0 to 0.8 wt%. As can be seen below, it is evident that as the concentration of PSf in the casting solution is increased (from P8 to P15), the initiation position of the macrovoid could be found deeper in the cross-section of the membranes. This can be explained by the increase in viscosity of the casting solution, which slowed down the mass transfer kinetics (this will be proven in the next section). After water was added into the casting solution of P8, it was found that the initial position of macrovoid formation appeared deeper in the cross-section of the membrane. Consequently, when more water was added (P8-D1.5), all the macrovoids were suppressed. Similar trends were observed in P8, P12 and P15, as more non-solvent is introduced in the casting solution, complete macrovoid suppression was achieved. In addition, the bi-continuous structure was well maintained in all conditions as evidenced in the SEM images in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0540\" refid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig6\"/> which displays the higher magnification of the middle part of the cross-section. Moreover, no skin layer is observable in all PSf membranes as illustrated in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0545\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S1</ce:cross-ref>. In contrast, it seems that the amount of additive did not directly affect the surface morphology of the membranes (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0550\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S2</ce:cross-ref>), which all remained highly porous.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0230\" view=\"all\">It is a known fact that as the amount of solid content in the casting solution is increased, the porosity and pore size of the membranes would decrease. Therefore, a decline in the porosity and pore size of the membranes (P8 &gt; P10 &gt; P12 &gt; P15) is expected, and is proven in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0555\" refid=\"fig7\">Fig. 7</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig7\"/>. Based on this illustration, the porosity of the pristine membranes gradually decreased from 88% to 76% when the PSf concentration was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%. Likewise, the pore size was reduced from 0.65 μm to 0.30 μm. It was also apparent that the incorporation of non-solvent also resulted in a decrease in porosity and pore size of the membranes (in the same PSf concentration). The decrease in porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the disappearance of the large voids across the membranes. However, it is important to note that as the solid content is the same with and without water, we should acknowledge that porosity difference could only be due to the membrane thickness differences (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0560\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S3</ce:cross-ref>). For a same solid content and a same thickness, the porosity should be the same, regardless of the presence of macrovoids.</ce:para>\n",

With this, we measured the viscosity of PSf/2P casting solutions and of PSf/2P/water solutions. Since the viscosity of the polymer solution is shear-rate dependent, we report in the following zero-shear viscosity. The solution viscosity logically increased with increasing polymer concentration (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0570\" refid=\"fig8\">Fig. 8</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig8\"/>). Moreover, the viscosity tended to be low and constant below a certain concentration threshold and then drastically increased. According to polymer solution theory, there is a critical overlap concentration (<ce:italic>C*</ce:italic>) of polymer coils, which is the crossover concentration between the dilute and the semi-dilute concentration region. If the concentration of the polymer is below <ce:italic>C*</ce:italic>, the polymer clusters are segregated from each other, and it is commonly referred to as dilute regime. On the other hand, if the concentration is above <ce:italic>C*,</ce:italic> the solution becomes entangled as a result of the overlap between adjacent macromolecular coils. The concentration of the polymer at which the onset of significant entanglement occurs is pertained to as critical entanglement concentration (<ce:italic>C</ce:italic>\n",
       "<ce:inf loc=\"post\">\n",

PSf is predominantly hydrophobic due to the large presence of aryl groups. When water is added into the system, the PSf chains will be oriented in a way that the hydrophilic segments, sulfonyl and ether groups, are exposed which was induced by hydrophobic hydration [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0585\" refid=\"bib89\">89</ce:cross-ref>]. This phenomenon triggers the aryl groups to be “coiled up or hidden” to decrease the enthalpy of the system creating spots of cohesion entanglement among the PSf chains (as shown in the insets of <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0590\" refid=\"fig8\">Fig. 8</ce:cross-ref>). Moreover, as stated in the previous studies of Kahrs and Schellenbach [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0595\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>], Wang et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0600\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0605\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>], Mousavi and Zadhoush [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0610\" refid=\"bib41\">41</ce:cross-ref>], and Mousavi et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0615\" refid=\"bib42\">42</ce:cross-ref>], the addition of water into the casting solution could lead to interchain hydrogen bonding which can result in increased which can result in decreased solvent power and aggregation of the macromolecules which then induces the viscosity of the system to be enhanced. Therefore, as more water is added into the casting solution, more points of entanglement among the polymer chains are created causing the viscosity to be enhanced.</ce:para>\n",

Correlating these values with the SEM from <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0630\" refid=\"fig5\">Fig. 5</ce:cross-ref>, we can infer that the addition of water has caused the onset of chain entanglement which evidently increased the viscosity which aided in the mitigation of macrovoid growth. Also, when the polymer concentration in the casting solution is higher than the critical chain entanglement, the initiation position of macrovoids shifted to somewhere below the membrane surface. Conversely, when there is no chain entanglement (PSf-D0), macrovoids are present along the cross-section of the membrane. In addition, when more non-solvent additive is added into the casting solution, the entanglement concentration was found to decrease (increased chain entanglement), suggesting that for a much lower polymer concentration, we can fine-tune the substructure of the membrane. This can provide positive impacts in terms of fabricating membranes at a more cost-effective approach.</ce:para>\n",

At the outset, it is important to note that the mechanical strength of the membrane is in correlation to the concentration of the polymer. Therefore, it is obvious that as the concentration of PSf is increased, the modulus of elasticity also increased from 40 to 130 MPa. Besides, as we increased the PSf concentration in 2P, we were also able to prevent the initiation of macrovoid growth near the top part of the membrane and then the formation of the macrovoids across the entire cross-section of the membranes. This has led to the increase in the modulus of elasticity of the modified membranes. Additionally, we compared the mechanical strength of PSf membrane prepared with 2P to that of prepared using NMP (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0715\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S6</ce:cross-ref>). As expected, the large macrovoids found in PSf/NMP membranes acted as weak spots which contributed to it having lower tensile strength.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0300\" view=\"all\">To summarize, using 2P as a solvent allowed the easy fabrication of PSf MF (skin-free) membranes through NIPS process, which is deemed difficult to achieve using other solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc without the addition of additives. However, macrovoids are still present along its cross-section. The addition of a sufficient amount of water (which content is dependent upon the phase diagram) permits to totally suppress the macrovoids without sacrificing the pore size and porosity of the membranes. So, skin-free and macrovoids-free PSf membranes can be prepared using 2P as the solvent and water as a non-solvent additive. As the pore connectivity is maintained, so is the membrane permeability. But as the morphology of the cross-section is no longer asymmetric with large macrovoids, instead replaced with symmetric with continuous connected domains, the mechanical strength of the membranes was enhanced without waiving the permeability. These findings could help provide an easy and economical approach to suppress macrovoids without using expensive organic or inorganic additives, or using intricate methods to fabricate macrovoid-free membranes. <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0720\" refid=\"fig16\">Fig. 16</ce:cross-ref>\n",

       "['Versatile, facile, easy, and economical, these are the advantages that immersion precipitation or non-solvent phase separation (NIPS) offers [1-3]. Due to these, NIPS process has been regarded as the most widely-used approach in fabricating flat sheet membranes from a variety of polymers [4]. In addition, NIPS can provide a wide-range of pore size: from microfiltration to nanofiltration [5]. In this process, a polymer of choice is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Once homogeneous, the polymeric solution is cast onto a support and phase-inversion is prompted through direct immersion in a coagulation bath/non-solvent bath (typically water), generating a polymer rich phase that transforms into the membrane matrix after polymer precipitation, and a polymer lean phase which develops into pores after demixing [6].',\n",
       " 'Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is amongst the most extensively used commercial membranes due to its favorable attributes such as high glass transition temperature (Tg = 190 degC), high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance over a wide-range of pH, good thermal resistance, exceptional biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication [7-9]. PSf membranes are commonly used in wastewater treatment [10-14], hemodialysis [15-17], protein purification [18-22], food processing [23], and so on. Polar solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [1,24-27], N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [9,28-31], and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) [32-35] are usually used to dissolved PSf polymers. Utilizing these solvents to prepare PSf membranes via NIPS process generally leads to formation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with relatively dense surface structure and porous sub-structure. Meanwhile, the cross-section of these membranes is composed of large macrovoids with walls having cellular-like structure [36] which could generate low flux due to the closed-pore structure (the pores are not interconnected with each other) that could potentially slow down the flow of water across the membrane. Additionally, concerns have been expressed on the use of such solvents to prepare polymeric membranes due to their toxicity which can cause adverse effects to our health. Besides, during NIPS process, these solvents are released into the coagulation bath during the membrane formation, and residual solvents are further extracted in the washing bath. These constitute to the release of 20-50 billion liters of contaminated water annually [1,37], and if not properly treated, can create immense damages to the environment. Hence, the use of these solvents in industries are now strictly regulated. In May 2020, the European Union has imposed a mandate on the use of NMP which has led researchers to find \"greener\" and more sustainable solvents [24,37] that have high affinity towards the PSf polymer. Alongside the prospect of tuning the morphology and suppressing macrovoids using alternative solvents.',\n",
       " 'As a result of the raising interest to improve the sustainability of PSf membrane production, several different solvents have been investigated in the past with respect to their suitability for replacing harmful solvents. In recent studies conducted by Kahrs and Schwellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42] the use of utilizing 2-pyrrolidone (2P) solvent as a substitute for NMP was explored. 2P is an organic compound derived from g-butyrolactone with considerable similarities with NMP as shown in Table 1. To date, there are no known life-threatening risks accompanied by using 2P, making it a potential alternative for NMP.',\n",
       " \"Standard NIPS process yield skinned asymmetric membranes with large macrovoids that could either have closed pore (cellular) structure or interconnected open pore (bi-continuous structure) [39,43]. Macrovoids are defects that grow perpendicular or near perpendicular to the skin or top layer [44]. They are large in size, and have elongated or teardrop-shaped pores ranging from 10 to 50 mm [45]. The presence of these large macrovoids can weaken the structural integrity of the membranes which can lead to breakage and total failure during operation [46]. Since the first development of phase-inversion process by Leob and Sourirajan in the 1960's [47], macrovoid formation have confounded researchers which has led to the development of different studies to understand macrovoid formation [39,44,48]. Numerous models were proposed for the formation of macrovoids. Early on, Reuvers and Smolders suggested that macrovoids were formed as the result of the nucleation of the polymer poor phase [49]. Strathmann et al. explained that the macrovoid was initiated by the rupture of the polymeric skin caused by shrinkage stress-induced-syneresis [50]. Other researchers considered that macrovoid formation stemmed from the thermodynamics aspects of chemical potential gradient [43,51-53]. Additional theories include Marangoni effects [54], solutocapillary convection mechanism [55-57], osmotic pressure [58] and combination of different mechanisms [59]. Nonetheless, several methods have been investigated to reduce macrovoid formation during immersion precipitation due to their weak mechanical strength. These include (i) choosing a solvent and non-solvent pair with low affinity towards each other; (ii) increasing the viscosity of the casting solution by increasing the polymer concentration or adding additives; and (iii) adding solvent to the coagulation bath [39,43,60-62].\",\n",
       " 'Although adding solvent to the coagulation bath seem to be the easiest option however, this could lead to increased production costs and pollution. The addition of additives has been the most explored strategies to mitigate the growth of macrovoids, and adding amounts of hydrophilic polymers such polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most predominant [63-65]. Some studies revealed that the addition of these hydrophilic polymers can enlarge the size of the macrovoids, while other studies reported the opposite as highlighted in the study by Sadrzadeh and Bhattacharjee [64]. These inconsistencies could be due to the fact that PVP and PEG are originally utilized as pore formers for polymeric membranes. They form pores as they leach out of the cast film upon immersion in the coagulation bath. However, depending on the molecular weights of the PVP and PEG [64], some can get trapped in the polymeric matrix. Therefore, the molecular weights of these materials have to be taken into great considerations before being used to suppress macrovoids. On the other hand, other researchers have used non-solvents such as water [24,38,39,66], ethanol [65] and other organic solvents [66,67] to control the exchange rates of the solvent and coagulant. Among these, water appear to be the most logical option due to its accessibility, abundancy, low-cost, and non-toxicity.',\n",
       " 'As of this writing, there are only 4 published works on PSf/2P system. Mousavi and colleagues intensively worked on the dynamics of using 2P as a sole solvent for PSf, and a co-solvent, and how the rheology of these conditions contributed to the resulting cross-section structure of PSf membranes [41,42]. Since standard NIPS process produce ultrafiltration PSf membrane, Wang et al. in their earlier work [40], explored the use of vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process to obtain PSf membranes with highly porous surface and cross-section. Recently, Wang and colleagues observed the macrovoid initiation position in PSf/2P system prepared by NIPS process [39]. These previous works have provided initial understanding on the solvency of PSf in 2P, and on how the viscoelasticity of the casting solution affects the cross-section of PSf membranes. It is important to note that, except for the work on PSf/2P using VIPS process, the other studies only focused on the morphology of the cross-section of PSf membranes, specifically on the growth of macrovoids.',\n",
       " 'This study encompasses two major objectives: (i) fabrication of highly porous PSf membranes through NIPS process using 2P as the solvent, and (ii) the suppression of macrovoid growth by using water as a non-solvent additive in the PSf/2P casting solution. Although, other studies [38,39] have previously explored the feasibility of this concept, they have not fully determined the amount of water that can be added to achieve macrovoid-free PSf membranes. Moreover, in this study, in-depth evaluations of the physical properties such morphology, porosity, pore size, permeability, and mechanical property of the PSf membranes with respect to the concentration of the additive are thoroughly carried out. Fig. 1 shows the three major parts of this study. The first part, heavily revolves on trying to understand how the nature of solvency of 2P affects the morphology of the PSf membranes, and its viability as a replacement for NMP solvent. Next, once the fundamental concepts of 2P/PSf system are established, the use of water as an additive in the casting solution to suppress macrovoids is examined. Herein, we shall probe into the viscosity of the solution, study the ternary diagram, and investigate the kinetics that took place during phase-inversion. In addition, comprehensive analysis of the physical properties of the membranes such as porosity, pore size, morphology, permeability, and mechanical properties will be examined. Lastly, the potential application of this concept will also be extended to other systems such as PSf/NMP, PSf/DMAc, and PSf/DMF to test the practicality of using water to suppress macrovoids.',\n",

       " \"The nature of the solvent plays a pertinent role in the morphology of the membranes [71]. For many years, Hansen's solubility parameters have been used as a guide in understanding the solubility of the polymer in a particular solvent. In this study, we have used equation (2a) to determine the solubility of PSf polymer in different solvents:(2a)dS-P= [(dD,S- dD,P)2 + (dP,S- dP,P)2 + (dH,S- dH,P)2]0.5Where dD, dP, and dH pertain to the van der Waals or dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding forces, respectively. The suffix S and P refer to solvent and polymer. Parameters for different PSf/solvent systems are provided in Table 2. From this, it can be inferred that out of the 3 solvents, PSf has the highest affinity towards DMF, followed by NMP, DMAc and 2P.\",\n",
       " 'Among the different mathematical models used to describe the thermodynamics of ternary systems, Flory-Huggins theory is the most sought after due to its relatively simple mathematical model and good accuracy of the phase behavior [72,73]. It is important to note that by constructing the ternary thermodynamics phase diagram of the phase-inversion process, we can get an insight into the composition paths of the demixed system. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (Table 3) of the systems can be estimated using the solubility parameters from Table 2, and their relationship can be transcribed to equation (3a) [73]:(3a)khi3=V1RT(d1-d2)2i=1,2where khi3 is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, V1 is the pure molar volume for component 1, and d1 is the solubility parameter for component i. Later, Hansen introduced a correction factor, a:(4)khi3=aV1RT[(d1,d-d2,d)2+0.25(d1,p-d2,p)2+0.25(d1,h-d2,h)2i=1,2',\n",
       " \"Fig. 2 illustrates the ternary diagrams of (a) PSf/NMP//water and (b) PSf/2P/water. The binary interaction parameters (kh) such as PSf-2P, PSf-water, and 2P-water used in this study were similar to that of Wang's group [40]. In their work, they used the same values of khNMP-water for kh2P-water. According to their calculations (with the data of excess Gibbs free energy reported from Ref. [75]), the values of khNMP-water and kh2P-water at 40 degC are close hence, they assumed that they are also close at 25 degC. They further verified this by measuring the water compositions in the 2P/water and NMP/water when they are in equilibrium with water vapor in the humid air (25 degC, 70% relative humidity) which showed similar values of both binary interactions. Although the similarity between NMP and 2P (Table 1) is quite intriguing in spite of the increased hydrogen bonding of 2P, it was indicated by Aparicio et al. [76], that 2P supposedly favors forming cyclic dimer due to the inter-molecule hydrogen bonding. Instead of forming hydrogen bond with water, it forms a cyclic dimer that weakens its affinity towards water.\",\n",
       " 'In addition, the solvent-polymer interaction (khPSf-2P and khPSf-NMP) also provides a quantitative information on the degree of interaction of polymer and solvent. According to literature [72], if khpolymer-solvent is less than 0.5, the solvent has high affinity towards the polymer, and is considered a good solvent. Conversely, if it is higher than 0.5, it is regarded as a poor solvent. As shown in Tables 2 and 2P is a poorer solvent than NMP therefore, the homogeneous region of PSf/2P/water phase diagram is narrower than PSf/NMP/water. This indicates that it would take less amount of non-solvent (water) to induce demixing in PSf/2P system. The cloud points in Fig. 2 denoted the amount of water needed to demix the system. For PSf/2P system, it takes about 2 wt% of water to phase separate the solution, and as the amount of PSf in the solution is increased, it takes a lesser amount of non-solvent to induce phase-inversion. With this knowledge, we can identify how much non-solvent additive we can add into the casting solution without causing phase-inversion. Another key parameter that must be considered is the relative energy difference (RED) which provides information on whether the parameters of the two molecules (usually a polymer and solvent) are within range. This can be measured according to the following equations [2,77,78]:(5)Ro=(dD2+dP2)0.5-dH(6)Ra2=4(dD,P-dD,S)2+(dP,P-dP,S)2+(dH,P-dH,S)2(7)RED=RaRo',\n",
       " 'Ro denotes the interaction radius of the polymer, and Ra refers to the solubility parameter distance. The ratio of Ra and Ro tells us that if it is < 1, the polymer is soluble in the chosen solvent, while the opposite transpires if it is > 1, and if the ratio is 1, the polymer can only be partially dissolved in the solvent. The calculated RED of the systems are 0.72, and 0.69 for PSf/2P and PSf/NMP, respectively. Hence, we can confirm that PSf polymer is soluble in 2P, and be can be used as a \"greener\" solvent replacement for NMP.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 3 shows the comparison of two PSf membranes (having the same concentration) fabricated via NIPS using 2 different solvents. Left-hand figure displays the surface and cross-section morphology of the PSf membrane when NMP was used as a solvent, while the right-hand figure represents the PSf/2P system. Starting with the PSf/NMP system, a dense surface structure was obtained which is consistent with other published works [1,24-27] while, a skinned asymmetric membrane with large finger-like macrovoids extending from the top part to the bottom part of the membranes with walls having cellular-like structure was obtained. In contrast, when 2P was used as a solvent, the surface structure of the PSf membranes have obvious large pores in the microfiltration (MF) range (to be confirmed in sections 3.2 and 3.3). Meanwhile, it appears that the macrovoids were found at the deeper part of the membrane. Zoomed-in images of the membrane reveal that instead of cellular-like structure, 2P solvent generated interconnected pores or bi-continuous structure which is in agreement with the previous studies by Wang et al. [39,40] when 2P is used as a solvent.',\n",
       " 'Although there are numerous studies tackling phase-inversion of casting solution to form membranes, the concept governing demixing is still tricky to understand. Many studies have suggested that if a solvent has a high affinity or high miscibility with the non-solvent, instantaneous demixing would occur. In other words, the fast exchange between the solvent and non-solvent induces the rapid precipitation of the polymer and formation of the film, within seconds of immersion in the coagulation or non-solvent bath. With this type of demixing, a highly porous cross-section (finger-like macrovoids) is obtained. On the other hand, if the solvent has a low affinity towards the non-solvent, a slow exchange occurs, which decelerates the formation of the film. Membranes with relatively dense top layer and sponge-like substructure are achieved during delayed demixing [4]. However, other studies suggest that instantaneous demixing can help mitigate the formation of macrovoids [79]. With these ambiguities in membrane formation, Hong et al. [39] studied the demixing that transpires during phase separation process.',\n",
       " 'A homogeneous casting solution can be demixed through nucleation and growth (NG) or spinodal decomposition (SD) depending on the solution composition at which the phase separation occurs [80]. For the demixing to occur via NG, the phase separation composition must lie on the meta-stable or binodal region. Conversely, for SD to happen, the composition path must be found in the unstable or spinodal region. When phase-inversion happens via NG, the resulting morphology consists of nuclei of polymer-poor phase that can grow into macrovoids. Meanwhile, when phase-inversion occurs via SD, the subsequent morphology contains continuous polymer-poor phase but not nuclei type. If the demixing is accompanied by fast solvent and non-solvent exchange, the phase-inversion would typically be via SD, as evidenced by the formation of bi-continuous structure [39].',\n",
       " 'It was previously stated that NMP has a high affinity towards water hence, one would assume that the exchange of solvent and non-solvent is fast enough to cause SD demixing. However, this claim contradicts our observations in Fig. 3, as cellular-like structures are observed instead of bi-continuous morphology. Meanwhile, 2P has a low miscibility towards water (possible cyclic dimer), so it is expected that phase-inversion would transpire via NG, and poorly interconnected pores on the walls of the macrovoids are to be anticipated. However, the opposite was found on both membranes. To find out why such phenomena were observed, we evaluated the viscosity of both systems as illustrated at the bottom images of Fig. 3. Due to the poorer solvency of PSf in 2P, higher viscosity is attained. For the same concentration (15 wt%), PSf/2P system has 41% higher viscosity than PSf/NMP system. This suggest that the high viscosity of PSf/2P system slowed down the solvent and non-solvent exchange which helped maintain the open porous structure and interconnected pores by mitigating the coarsening process. Conversely, NMP is a good solvent for PSf. Its high affinity for water permitted fast solvent and non-solvent exchanges, while the low viscosity (553 cP) of the system could not prevent coarsening during the phase-inversion process. So, phase-inversion may occur by SD, but the structure is not fixed and can still evolve after phase-separation. As a result, large macrovoids were observed across the membrane with cellular-like structure.',\n",
       " 'As stated previously, earlier works did not explore the effect of 2P on the surface morphology of PSf membranes via NIPS process. In this study, we found out that by using 2P as solvent, we could easily obtain PSf membranes in the MF range. Normally, NIPS process generates ultrafiltration membranes as a result of the fast solvent and non-solvent exchange that transpires in the coagulation bath which typically results in the formation of a relatively dense top surface also known as skin layer [49,81-84]. Based on the study conducted by Strathmann, asymmetric morphology arises from the steep concentration, and activity gradient of the polymer, solvent and non-solvent. If the affinity of the solvent and non-solvent towards each other is high, as soon as the water is introduced on the surface of the film, the resulting chemical composition at the interface reaches in a short time a value indicating a phase separation has occurred, due to the fast mass transfer kinetics between the solvent and non-solvent. Where in fact, the internal of the film is still very far below the binodal point [85,86]. In order to slow down the exchange at the interface, additives can be introduced into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. That is why researchers commonly incorporate additives such as PEG or PVP to obtain PSf MF. To obtain PSf MF membranes, additives such PEG or PVP are added into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. However, even without additives, PSf/2P system is viscous enough (compared to PSf/NMP) to allow slower mass transfer kinetics during phase-inversion which permitted the formation of porous surface structure as shown in Fig. 4. But it is important to note that the amount of solid content would also influence the viscosity of the solution which could decrease the porosity of the membrane. Hence, it is evident in Fig. 4 that the surface porosity decreases with the polysulfone content (which will be verified later by dedicated measurements).',\n",
       " 'The preceding results show that by using 2P as a solvent for PSf polymers, membrane with bi-continuous morphology in the entire cross-section can obtained. Having bi-continuous structure would be beneficial for faster permeation unlike cellular-like structure which are closed pores (not interconnected).',\n",
       " 'In the introduction, we have stated the different ways to suppress macrovoid growth in polymeric membranes. Among these different approaches, adding additives into the casting solution seem to be the easiest and most economical. PVP, PEG, non-solvent, etc., are some of the most used additives to mitigate macrovoid growth. In this study, we chose water as the additive because of its abundancy and availability, cost-effectiveness, and it will not be trapped in the polymer domain (unlike polymeric additives) during the phase-inversion process. Fig. 5 shows the entire cross-section of the different membranes prepared: P8, P10, P12, and P15 which consist of 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf in 2P, respectively. The amount of water added into the casting solution was dependent on the cloud point evaluation from Fig. 2, that is to avoid phase-separation of the casting solution. For P8, the amount of DI water was varied from 0 to 1.5 wt%. Meanwhile, for P10 and P12, 0-1.0 wt% of water was added. Lastly, for P12, the concentration of DI water was from 0 to 0.8 wt%. As can be seen below, it is evident that as the concentration of PSf in the casting solution is increased (from P8 to P15), the initiation position of the macrovoid could be found deeper in the cross-section of the membranes. This can be explained by the increase in viscosity of the casting solution, which slowed down the mass transfer kinetics (this will be proven in the next section). After water was added into the casting solution of P8, it was found that the initial position of macrovoid formation appeared deeper in the cross-section of the membrane. Consequently, when more water was added (P8-D1.5), all the macrovoids were suppressed. Similar trends were observed in P8, P12 and P15, as more non-solvent is introduced in the casting solution, complete macrovoid suppression was achieved. In addition, the bi-continuous structure was well maintained in all conditions as evidenced in the SEM images in Fig. 6 which displays the higher magnification of the middle part of the cross-section. Moreover, no skin layer is observable in all PSf membranes as illustrated in Fig. S1. In contrast, it seems that the amount of additive did not directly affect the surface morphology of the membranes (Fig. S2), which all remained highly porous.',\n",
       " 'It is a known fact that as the amount of solid content in the casting solution is increased, the porosity and pore size of the membranes would decrease. Therefore, a decline in the porosity and pore size of the membranes (P8 > P10 > P12 > P15) is expected, and is proven in Fig. 7. Based on this illustration, the porosity of the pristine membranes gradually decreased from 88% to 76% when the PSf concentration was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%. Likewise, the pore size was reduced from 0.65 mm to 0.30 mm. It was also apparent that the incorporation of non-solvent also resulted in a decrease in porosity and pore size of the membranes (in the same PSf concentration). The decrease in porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the disappearance of the large voids across the membranes. However, it is important to note that as the solid content is the same with and without water, we should acknowledge that porosity difference could only be due to the membrane thickness differences (Fig. S3). For a same solid content and a same thickness, the porosity should be the same, regardless of the presence of macrovoids.',\n",
       " 'The viscosity of the casting solutions holds a vital role in determining the morphology of the membranes [40]. With this, we measured the viscosity of PSf/2P casting solutions and of PSf/2P/water solutions. Since the viscosity of the polymer solution is shear-rate dependent, we report in the following zero-shear viscosity. The solution viscosity logically increased with increasing polymer concentration (Fig. 8). Moreover, the viscosity tended to be low and constant below a certain concentration threshold and then drastically increased. According to polymer solution theory, there is a critical overlap concentration (C*) of polymer coils, which is the crossover concentration between the dilute and the semi-dilute concentration region. If the concentration of the polymer is below C*, the polymer clusters are segregated from each other, and it is commonly referred to as dilute regime. On the other hand, if the concentration is above C*, the solution becomes entangled as a result of the overlap between adjacent macromolecular coils. The concentration of the polymer at which the onset of significant entanglement occurs is pertained to as critical entanglement concentration (Ce), and it is within the semi-dilute entangled regime [87,88]. PSf is predominantly hydrophobic due to the large presence of aryl groups. When water is added into the system, the PSf chains will be oriented in a way that the hydrophilic segments, sulfonyl and ether groups, are exposed which was induced by hydrophobic hydration [89]. This phenomenon triggers the aryl groups to be \"coiled up or hidden\" to decrease the enthalpy of the system creating spots of cohesion entanglement among the PSf chains (as shown in the insets of Fig. 8). Moreover, as stated in the previous studies of Kahrs and Schellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42], the addition of water into the casting solution could lead to interchain hydrogen bonding which can result in increased which can result in decreased solvent power and aggregation of the macromolecules which then induces the viscosity of the system to be enhanced. Therefore, as more water is added into the casting solution, more points of entanglement among the polymer chains are created causing the viscosity to be enhanced.',\n",
       " 'By taking the straight lines used to fit the curves of the log-log plot of the zero-shear viscosity and PSf concentration (Fig. 9), we were able to determine the critical overlap concentration and the critical entanglement concentration of the casting solutions without additive, and with 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% water. In Fig. 9a, in which no additive was additive into the casting solutions, we determined that the C* is 9.7 wt%, and no onset of entanglement occurred from 2 wt% to 18 wt% (it is probable that Ce would occur at higher concentrations). However, when 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% of water were added into the casting solution, 2 things could be observed: (1) critical chain entanglement ensued; and (2) both values of C* and Ce decreased with increasing amount of additive added. Correlating these values with the SEM from Fig. 5, we can infer that the addition of water has caused the onset of chain entanglement which evidently increased the viscosity which aided in the mitigation of macrovoid growth. Also, when the polymer concentration in the casting solution is higher than the critical chain entanglement, the initiation position of macrovoids shifted to somewhere below the membrane surface. Conversely, when there is no chain entanglement (PSf-D0), macrovoids are present along the cross-section of the membrane. In addition, when more non-solvent additive is added into the casting solution, the entanglement concentration was found to decrease (increased chain entanglement), suggesting that for a much lower polymer concentration, we can fine-tune the substructure of the membrane. This can provide positive impacts in terms of fabricating membranes at a more cost-effective approach.',\n",
       " \"Aside from this, we have also analyzed the viscoelastic properties of the casting solution and how it is being influenced by the addition of water. Fig. S4 presents the graph of the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G'') as a function of angular frequency. The storage modulus is a measure of the elasticity of the solution and pertains to its ability to store energy. On the other hand, the loss modulus is a measure of the viscosity of the solution and pertains to its ability to dissipate. If G'' > G' the system behaves like a liquid while if the G'' < G' behaves like a gel [87]. Based on Fig. S4, all the systems exhibit a viscous behavior. When water is added, both G' and G'' visibly increased which can be attributed to the enhanced viscosity induced by the hydrogen bonding and subsequent chain entanglement [41].\",\n",
       " 'Aside from probing into the thermodynamics and viscosity of the PSf/2P/water system, it is also essential to investigate the kinetics of the phase-inversion process. We observed the movement of the phase separation front of the casting solutions with varying concentrations of polysulfone under an optical microscope as depicted in Fig. 10. As it was pointed out in the previous sections of this work, higher viscosity could slow down the kinetics of the mass transfer hence, when the concentration of PSf was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%, it was clear that it took the non-solvent a longer time to traverse the P15 system.',\n",
       " 'In fact, when comparing the position of the diffusion front as a function of time for different concentration of PSf in 2P without additives as illustrated in Fig. 11a, after 120 s of phase inversion, the non-solvent travelled a distance of 0.45 mm, 0.32 mm, 0.30 mm, 0.25 mm for P8, P10, P12 and P15, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 11b presents the related diffusion distance vs. square root of time plot.',\n",
       " 'Assuming that the dark ridges found after the interface corresponds to the initial diffusion position of water, then the diffusivity of water in the system (Dw/s) can be determined based on the equation proposed by Strathmann et al. [61].(2b)d2=4(Dw/set)(1-CW1+CW)twhere d denotes the diffusion distance, e/t represents a geometrical factor for the porosity and tortuosity of the membrane being formed, CW is the water concentration at the interface between the non-solvent and the polymeric system, t pertains to time.',\n",
       " 'Under the supposition that the concentration of water in the solution at the point of precipitation is small relative to unity so, equation (2b) can be simplified to the following expression (equation (3b)) to determine the effective diffusivity De. This De contains the geometrical correction factor e/t.(3b)d=2(Det)0.5',\n",
       " 'With the above expression, the calculated effective diffusivity of water in P8, P10, P12 and P15 are 3.23 x 10-4, 2.60 x 10-4, 2.51 x 10-4 and 2.08 x 10-4 mm2/s, respectively. Thus, verifying our previous claim that with higher viscosity, kinetics of mass transfer was evidently slowed down.',\n",
       " 'Next, the kinetics of non-solvent (water) in the PSf/2P/water casting solutions were examined and presented in Fig. 12. In P8 system, no significant trend was seen which could be attributed to the considerably lower viscosity of the system. Moreover, due to the low polymer concentration (8 wt%), the position of the system lies close to the binodal line, which makes it easier to become thermodynamically unstable. On the other hand, in P10 - P15 systems, it was evident that there is an increasing trend in the non-solvent kinetics when the amount of additive was increased. This was then further verified by calculating the diffusion rates of the non-solvent as presented in Fig. 13.',\n",
       " 'In 2010, Hong et al. proposed a model for the initiation of macrovoids based on the relationship of the initial position of the macrovoid (L) and effective diffusivity (De, which is similar to diffusion coefficient) versus the normalized polymer concentration(C/Ce) [39]. According to their study, the PSf/2P, PSf/2P/water (0.5 wt%), and PSf/NMP systems can be fitted into an exponential growth curve. Similar relationship is also observed in our PSf/2P/water system as presented in Fig. S5.',\n",
       " 'Although macrovoids permits fast permeability due to their high porosity, they are considered weak points in the membrane because they are prone to compaction under high pressure operation, which eventually leads to poor flux performance over time. From the previous sections, we have provided data that shows the by adding water into the casting solution, we are able to successfully mitigate the growth of these unwanted macrovoids. Moreover, we have offered in-depth analysis as to how the thermodynamics of the ternary system, kinetics and viscosity affect the morphology of the membranes. To further our study, we have investigated the effects of incorporating additives into the casting solution to help suppress macrovoids to the permeability properties and mechanical strengths of the membranes as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Since Figs. 4 and 5 prove that all of the fabricated membranes are suitable for microfiltration, we decided to investigate the pure water flux of the pristine and modified PSf membranes under a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar. Fig. 14 shows that even though the macrovoids disappeared, similar permeabilities are still maintained which could be due to two possible reasons: First, the additive concentration did not directly influence the surface porosity of the membranes having the same polymeric content. Second, although the huge macrovoids were suppressed, the interconnected pores along the cross-section still permitted fast permeation.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, Fig. 15 displays the measured modulus of elasticity of the membranes obtained from tensile stress/strain plots. At the outset, it is important to note that the mechanical strength of the membrane is in correlation to the concentration of the polymer. Therefore, it is obvious that as the concentration of PSf is increased, the modulus of elasticity also increased from 40 to 130 MPa. Besides, as we increased the PSf concentration in 2P, we were also able to prevent the initiation of macrovoid growth near the top part of the membrane and then the formation of the macrovoids across the entire cross-section of the membranes. This has led to the increase in the modulus of elasticity of the modified membranes. Additionally, we compared the mechanical strength of PSf membrane prepared with 2P to that of prepared using NMP (Fig. S6). As expected, the large macrovoids found in PSf/NMP membranes acted as weak spots which contributed to it having lower tensile strength.',\n",
       " 'To summarize, using 2P as a solvent allowed the easy fabrication of PSf MF (skin-free) membranes through NIPS process, which is deemed difficult to achieve using other solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc without the addition of additives. However, macrovoids are still present along its cross-section. The addition of a sufficient amount of water (which content is dependent upon the phase diagram) permits to totally suppress the macrovoids without sacrificing the pore size and porosity of the membranes. So, skin-free and macrovoids-free PSf membranes can be prepared using 2P as the solvent and water as a non-solvent additive. As the pore connectivity is maintained, so is the membrane permeability. But as the morphology of the cross-section is no longer asymmetric with large macrovoids, instead replaced with symmetric with continuous connected domains, the mechanical strength of the membranes was enhanced without waiving the permeability. These findings could help provide an easy and economical approach to suppress macrovoids without using expensive organic or inorganic additives, or using intricate methods to fabricate macrovoid-free membranes. Fig. 16 illustrates the short summary of these results.',\n",
       " 'To evaluate the viability of using non-solvent as an additive to suppress macrovoids, we have utilized other solvents such NMP DMAc and DMF to prepare polysulfone membranes. We initially established their respective ternary diagrams (Fig. 2 for PSf/NMP/water and Fig. 17 for PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water) to first identify up to how much water could be added into the casting solution before phase separation occurs. Based on the solubility parameters from Table 1, DMF and DMAc solvents are also considered good solvents to PSf polymer. This is also evidenced by the large homogeneous area of PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water ternary systems illustrated in Fig. 17. Moreover, the cloud points also revealed that it would take more coagulant (water) to induce demixing of the system.',\n",
       " 'In order to find out the versatility of the water as a means to prevent macrovoid formation, we have prepared 25% of PSf in NMP, 20% of PSf in DMAc, and 15% of PSf in DMF via the NIPS process. We have varied the concentrations of the additive from 0 to 3 wt% for PSf/NMP, 0-2 wt% for PSf/DMAc and 0-1 wt% for PSf/DMF casting solutions. The SEM cross-section images in Fig. 18 reveal that when water was added into the casting solution of PSf/NMP, the macrovoids were effectively suppressed. Similar phenomena were observed in PSf membranes prepared using DMAc (Fig. 19a) and DMF (Fig. 19b) solvents. These results prove that using water as an additive in the casting solution provides a practical and cost-effective approach to tune the morphology of polysulfone membranes from controlling the growth of macrovoids to its overall suppression.',\n",
       " 'In this study we first investigated the use of 2P solvent to prepare polysulfone membranes in replace of the more commonly used NMP solvent. Being a poorer solvent than NMP, the nature of solvency of 2P greatly influenced the kinetics, viscosity, and thermodynamics stability of the system. The following major conclusions can be made:*The fabricated membranes are skin-free and fall in the microfiltration range.*The lower affinity of 2P towards polysulfone (compared to NMP) greatly increased the viscosity of the casting solution which prevented coarsening. As a result, bi-continuous substructures were formed.

       "[['Versatile, facile, easy, and economical, these are the advantages that immersion precipitation or non-solvent phase separation (NIPS) offers [1-3]. Due to these, NIPS process has been regarded as the most widely-used approach in fabricating flat sheet membranes from a variety of polymers [4]. In addition, NIPS can provide a wide-range of pore size: from microfiltration to nanofiltration [5]. In this process, a polymer of choice is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Once homogeneous, the polymeric solution is cast onto a support and phase-inversion is prompted through direct immersion in a coagulation bath/non-solvent bath (typically water), generating a polymer rich phase that transforms into the membrane matrix after polymer precipitation, and a polymer lean phase which develops into pores after demixing [6].',\n",
       "  'Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is amongst the most extensively used commercial membranes due to its favorable attributes such as high glass transition temperature (Tg = 190 degC), high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance over a wide-range of pH, good thermal resistance, exceptional biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication [7-9]. PSf membranes are commonly used in wastewater treatment [10-14], hemodialysis [15-17], protein purification [18-22], food processing [23], and so on. Polar solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [1,24-27], N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [9,28-31], and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) [32-35] are usually used to dissolved PSf polymers. Utilizing these solvents to prepare PSf membranes via NIPS process generally leads to formation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with relatively dense surface structure and porous sub-structure. Meanwhile, the cross-section of these membranes is composed of large macrovoids with walls having cellular-like structure [36] which could generate low flux due to the closed-pore structure (the pores are not interconnected with each other) that could potentially slow down the flow of water across the membrane. Additionally, concerns have been expressed on the use of such solvents to prepare polymeric membranes due to their toxicity which can cause adverse effects to our health. Besides, during NIPS process, these solvents are released into the coagulation bath during the membrane formation, and residual solvents are further extracted in the washing bath. These constitute to the release of 20-50 billion liters of contaminated water annually [1,37], and if not properly treated, can create immense damages to the environment. Hence, the use of these solvents in industries are now strictly regulated. In May 2020, the European Union has imposed a mandate on the use of NMP which has led researchers to find \"greener\" and more sustainable solvents [24,37] that have high affinity towards the PSf polymer. Alongside the prospect of tuning the morphology and suppressing macrovoids using alternative solvents.',\n",
       "  'As a result of the raising interest to improve the sustainability of PSf membrane production, several different solvents have been investigated in the past with respect to their suitability for replacing harmful solvents. In recent studies conducted by Kahrs and Schwellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42] the use of utilizing 2-pyrrolidone (2P) solvent as a substitute for NMP was explored. 2P is an organic compound derived from g-butyrolactone with considerable similarities with NMP as shown in Table 1. To date, there are no known life-threatening risks accompanied by using 2P, making it a potential alternative for NMP.',\n",
       "  \"Standard NIPS process yield skinned asymmetric membranes with large macrovoids that could either have closed pore (cellular) structure or interconnected open pore (bi-continuous structure) [39,43]. Macrovoids are defects that grow perpendicular or near perpendicular to the skin or top layer [44]. They are large in size, and have elongated or teardrop-shaped pores ranging from 10 to 50 mm [45]. The presence of these large macrovoids can weaken the structural integrity of the membranes which can lead to breakage and total failure during operation [46]. Since the first development of phase-inversion process by Leob and Sourirajan in the 1960's [47], macrovoid formation have confounded researchers which has led to the development of different studies to understand macrovoid formation [39,44,48]. Numerous models were proposed for the formation of macrovoids. Early on, Reuvers and Smolders suggested that macrovoids were formed as the result of the nucleation of the polymer poor phase [49]. Strathmann et al. explained that the macrovoid was initiated by the rupture of the polymeric skin caused by shrinkage stress-induced-syneresis [50]. Other researchers considered that macrovoid formation stemmed from the thermodynamics aspects of chemical potential gradient [43,51-53]. Additional theories include Marangoni effects [54], solutocapillary convection mechanism [55-57], osmotic pressure [58] and combination of different mechanisms [59]. Nonetheless, several methods have been investigated to reduce macrovoid formation during immersion precipitation due to their weak mechanical strength. These include (i) choosing a solvent and non-solvent pair with low affinity towards each other; (ii) increasing the viscosity of the casting solution by increasing the polymer concentration or adding additives; and (iii) adding solvent to the coagulation bath [39,43,60-62].\",\n",
       "  'Although adding solvent to the coagulation bath seem to be the easiest option however, this could lead to increased production costs and pollution. The addition of additives has been the most explored strategies to mitigate the growth of macrovoids, and adding amounts of hydrophilic polymers such polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most predominant [63-65]. Some studies revealed that the addition of these hydrophilic polymers can enlarge the size of the macrovoids, while other studies reported the opposite as highlighted in the study by Sadrzadeh and Bhattacharjee [64]. These inconsistencies could be due to the fact that PVP and PEG are originally utilized as pore formers for polymeric membranes. They form pores as they leach out of the cast film upon immersion in the coagulation bath. However, depending on the molecular weights of the PVP and PEG [64], some can get trapped in the polymeric matrix. Therefore, the molecular weights of these materials have to be taken into great considerations before being used to suppress macrovoids. On the other hand, other researchers have used non-solvents such as water [24,38,39,66], ethanol [65] and other organic solvents [66,67] to control the exchange rates of the solvent and coagulant. Among these, water appear to be the most logical option due to its accessibility, abundancy, low-cost, and non-toxicity.',\n",
       "  'As of this writing, there are only 4 published works on PSf/2P system. Mousavi and colleagues intensively worked on the dynamics of using 2P as a sole solvent for PSf, and a co-solvent, and how the rheology of these conditions contributed to the resulting cross-section structure of PSf membranes [41,42]. Since standard NIPS process produce ultrafiltration PSf membrane, Wang et al. in their earlier work [40], explored the use of vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process to obtain PSf membranes with highly porous surface and cross-section. Recently, Wang and colleagues observed the macrovoid initiation position in PSf/2P system prepared by NIPS process [39]. These previous works have provided initial understanding on the solvency of PSf in 2P, and on how the viscoelasticity of the casting solution affects the cross-section of PSf membranes. It is important to note that, except for the work on PSf/2P using VIPS process, the other studies only focused on the morphology of the cross-section of PSf membranes, specifically on the growth of macrovoids.',\n",

It is important to note that by constructing the ternary thermodynamics phase diagram of the phase-inversion process, we can get an insight into the composition paths of the demixed system. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (Table 3) of the systems can be estimated using the solubility parameters from Table 2, and their relationship can be transcribed to equation (3a) [73]:(3a)khi3=V1RT(d1-d2)2i=1,2where khi3 is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, V1 is the pure molar volume for component 1, and d1 is the solubility parameter for component i.

The binary interaction parameters (kh) such as PSf-2P, PSf-water, and 2P-water used in this study were similar to that of Wang's group [40]. In their work, they used the same values of khNMP-water for kh2P-water. According to their calculations (with the data of excess Gibbs free energy reported from Ref. [75]), the values of khNMP-water and kh2P-water at 40 degC are close hence, they assumed that they are also close at 25 degC. They further verified this by measuring the water compositions in the 2P/water and NMP/water when they are in equilibrium with water vapor in the humid air (25 degC, 70% relative humidity) which showed similar values of both binary interactions. Although the similarity between NMP and 2P (Table 1) is quite intriguing in spite of the increased hydrogen bonding of 2P, it was indicated by Aparicio et al. [76], that 2P supposedly favors forming cyclic dimer due to the inter-molecule hydrogen bonding. Instead of forming hydrogen bond with water, it forms a cyclic dimer that weakens its affinity towards water.\",\n",
       "  'In addition, the solvent-polymer interaction (khPSf-2P and khPSf-NMP) also provides a quantitative information on the degree of interaction of polymer and solvent. According to literature [72], if khpolymer-solvent is less than 0.5, the solvent has high affinity towards the polymer, and is considered a good solvent. Conversely, if it is higher than 0.5, it is regarded as a poor solvent. As shown in Tables 2 and 2P is a poorer solvent than NMP therefore, the homogeneous region of PSf/2P/water phase diagram is narrower than PSf/NMP/water. This indicates that it would take less amount of non-solvent (water) to induce demixing in PSf/2P system. The cloud points in Fig. 2 denoted the amount of water needed to demix the system. For PSf/2P system, it takes about 2 wt% of water to phase separate the solution, and as the amount of PSf in the solution is increased, it takes a lesser amount of non-solvent to induce phase-inversion. With this knowledge, we can identify how much non-solvent additive we can add into the casting solution without causing phase-inversion. Another key parameter that must be considered is the relative energy difference (RED) which provides information on whether the parameters of the two molecules (usually a polymer and solvent) are within range. This can be measured according to the following equations [2,77,78]:(5)Ro=(dD2+dP2)0.5-dH(6)Ra2=4(dD,P-dD,S)2+(dP,P-dP,S)2+(dH,P-dH,S)2(7)RED=RaRo',\n",

The calculated RED of the systems are 0.72, and 0.69 for PSf/2P and PSf/NMP, respectively.

Left-hand figure displays the surface and cross-section morphology of the PSf membrane when NMP was used as a solvent, while the right-hand figure represents the PSf/2P system. Starting with the PSf/NMP system, a dense surface structure was obtained which is consistent with other published works [1,24-27] while, a skinned asymmetric membrane with large finger-like macrovoids extending from the top part to the bottom part of the membranes with walls having cellular-like structure was obtained. In contrast, when 2P was used as a solvent, the surface structure of the PSf membranes have obvious large pores in the microfiltration (MF) range (to be confirmed in sections 3.2 and 3.3). Meanwhile, it appears that the macrovoids were found at the deeper part of the membrane. Zoomed-in images of the membrane reveal that instead of cellular-like structure, 2P solvent generated interconnected pores or bi-continuous structure which is in agreement with the previous studies by Wang et al. [39,40] when 2P is used as a solvent.',\n",
       "  'Although there are numerous studies tackling phase-inversion of casting solution to form membranes, the concept governing demixing is still tricky to understand. Many studies have suggested that if a solvent has a high affinity or high miscibility with the non-solvent, instantaneous demixing would occur. In other words, the fast exchange between the solvent and non-solvent induces the rapid precipitation of the polymer and formation of the film, within seconds of immersion in the coagulation or non-solvent bath. With this type of demixing, a highly porous cross-section (finger-like macrovoids) is obtained. On the other hand, if the solvent has a low affinity towards the non-solvent, a slow exchange occurs, which decelerates the formation of the film. Membranes with relatively dense top layer and sponge-like substructure are achieved during delayed demixing [4]. However, other studies suggest that instantaneous demixing can help mitigate the formation of macrovoids [79]. With these ambiguities in membrane formation, Hong et al. [39] studied the demixing that transpires during phase separation process.',\n",
       "  'A homogeneous casting solution can be demixed through nucleation and growth (NG) or spinodal decomposition (SD) depending on the solution composition at which the phase separation occurs [80]. For the demixing to occur via NG, the phase separation composition must lie on the meta-stable or binodal region. Conversely, for SD to happen, the composition path must be found in the unstable or spinodal region. When phase-inversion happens via NG, the resulting morphology consists of nuclei of polymer-poor phase that can grow into macrovoids. Meanwhile, when phase-inversion occurs via SD, the subsequent morphology contains continuous polymer-poor phase but not nuclei type. If the demixing is accompanied by fast solvent and non-solvent exchange, the phase-inversion would typically be via SD, as evidenced by the formation of bi-continuous structure [39].',\n",
       "  'It was previously stated that NMP has a high affinity towards water hence, one would assume that the exchange of solvent and non-solvent is fast enough to cause SD demixing. However, this claim contradicts our observations in Fig. 3, as cellular-like structures are observed instead of bi-continuous morphology. Meanwhile, 2P has a low miscibility towards water (possible cyclic dimer), so it is expected that phase-inversion would transpire via NG, and poorly interconnected pores on the walls of the macrovoids are to be anticipated. However, the opposite was found on both membranes. To find out why such phenomena were observed, we evaluated the viscosity of both systems as illustrated at the bottom images of Fig. 3. Due to the poorer solvency of PSf in 2P, higher viscosity is attained. For the same concentration (15 wt%), PSf/2P system has 41% higher viscosity than PSf/NMP system. This suggest that the high viscosity of PSf/2P system slowed down the solvent and non-solvent exchange which helped maintain the open porous structure and interconnected pores by mitigating the coarsening process. Conversely, NMP is a good solvent for PSf. Its high affinity for water permitted fast solvent and non-solvent exchanges, while the low viscosity (553 cP) of the system could not prevent coarsening during the phase-inversion process. So, phase-inversion may occur by SD, but the structure is not fixed and can still evolve after phase-separation. As a result, large macrovoids were observed across the membrane with cellular-like structure.',\n",
       "  'As stated previously, earlier works did not explore the effect of 2P on the surface morphology of PSf membranes via NIPS process. In this study, we found out that by using 2P as solvent, we could easily obtain PSf membranes in the MF range. Normally, NIPS process generates ultrafiltration membranes as a result of the fast solvent and non-solvent exchange that transpires in the coagulation bath which typically results in the formation of a relatively dense top surface also known as skin layer [49,81-84]. Based on the study conducted by Strathmann, asymmetric morphology arises from the steep concentration, and activity gradient of the polymer, solvent and non-solvent. If the affinity of the solvent and non-solvent towards each other is high, as soon as the water is introduced on the surface of the film, the resulting chemical composition at the interface reaches in a short time a value indicating a phase separation has occurred, due to the fast mass transfer kinetics between the solvent and non-solvent. Where in fact, the internal of the film is still very far below the binodal point [85,86]. In order to slow down the exchange at the interface, additives can be introduced into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. That is why researchers commonly incorporate additives such as PEG or PVP to obtain PSf MF. To obtain PSf MF membranes, additives such PEG or PVP are added into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. However, even without additives, PSf/2P system is viscous enough (compared to PSf/NMP) to allow slower mass transfer kinetics during phase-inversion which permitted the formation of porous surface structure as shown in Fig. 4. But it is important to note that the amount of solid content would also influence the viscosity of the solution which could decrease the porosity of the membrane. Hence, it is evident in Fig. 4 that the surface porosity decreases with the polysulfone content (which will be verified later by dedicated measurements).',\n",
       "  'The preceding results show that by using 2P as a solvent for PSf polymers, membrane with bi-continuous morphology in the entire cross-section can obtained. Having bi-continuous structure would be beneficial for faster permeation unlike cellular-like structure which are closed pores (not interconnected).',\n",
       "  'In the introduction, we have stated the different ways to suppress macrovoid growth in polymeric membranes. Among these different approaches, adding additives into the casting solution seem to be the easiest and most economical. PVP, PEG, non-solvent, etc., are some of the most used additives to mitigate macrovoid growth. In this study, we chose water as the additive because of its abundancy and availability, cost-effectiveness, and it will not be trapped in the polymer domain (unlike polymeric additives) during the phase-inversion process. Fig. 5 shows the entire cross-section of the different membranes prepared: P8, P10, P12, and P15 which consist of 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf in 2P, respectively. The amount of water added into the casting solution was dependent on the cloud point evaluation from Fig. 2, that is to avoid phase-separation of the casting solution. For P8, the amount of DI water was varied from 0 to 1.5 wt%. Meanwhile, for P10 and P12, 0-1.0 wt% of water was added. Lastly, for P12, the concentration of DI water was from 0 to 0.8 wt%. As can be seen below, it is evident that as the concentration of PSf in the casting solution is increased (from P8 to P15), the initiation position of the macrovoid could be found deeper in the cross-section of the membranes. This can be explained by the increase in viscosity of the casting solution, which slowed down the mass transfer kinetics (this will be proven in the next section). After water was added into the casting solution of P8, it was found that the initial position of macrovoid formation appeared deeper in the cross-section of the membrane. Consequently, when more water was added (P8-D1.5), all the macrovoids were suppressed. Similar trends were observed in P8, P12 and P15, as more non-solvent is introduced in the casting solution, complete macrovoid suppression was achieved. In addition, the bi-continuous structure was well maintained in all conditions as evidenced in the SEM images in Fig. 6 which displays the higher magnification of the middle part of the cross-section. Moreover, no skin layer is observable in all PSf membranes as illustrated in Fig. S1. In contrast, it seems that the amount of additive did not directly affect the surface morphology of the membranes (Fig. S2), which all remained highly porous.',\n",
       "  'It is a known fact that as the amount of solid content in the casting solution is increased, the porosity and pore size of the membranes would decrease. Therefore, a decline in the porosity and pore size of the membranes (P8 > P10 > P12 > P15) is expected, and is proven in Fig. 7. Based on this illustration, the porosity of the pristine membranes gradually decreased from 88% to 76% when the PSf concentration was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%. Likewise, the pore size was reduced from 0.65 mm to 0.30 mm. It was also apparent that the incorporation of non-solvent also resulted in a decrease in porosity and pore size of the membranes (in the same PSf concentration). The decrease in porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the disappearance of the large voids across the membranes. However, it is important to note that as the solid content is the same with and without water, we should acknowledge that porosity difference could only be due to the membrane thickness differences (Fig. S3). For a same solid content and a same thickness, the porosity should be the same, regardless of the presence of macrovoids.',\n",
       "  'The viscosity of the casting solutions holds a vital role in determining the morphology of the membranes [40]. With this, we measured the viscosity of PSf/2P casting solutions and of PSf/2P/water solutions. Since the viscosity of the polymer solution is shear-rate dependent, we report in the following zero-shear viscosity. The solution viscosity logically increased with increasing polymer concentration (Fig. 8). Moreover, the viscosity tended to be low and constant below a certain concentration threshold and then drastically increased. According to polymer solution theory, there is a critical overlap concentration (C*) of polymer coils, which is the crossover concentration between the dilute and the semi-dilute concentration region. If the concentration of the polymer is below C*, the polymer clusters are segregated from each other, and it is commonly referred to as dilute regime. On the other hand, if the concentration is above C*, the solution becomes entangled as a result of the overlap between adjacent macromolecular coils. The concentration of the polymer at which the onset of significant entanglement occurs is pertained to as critical entanglement concentration (Ce), and it is within the semi-dilute entangled regime [87,88]. PSf is predominantly hydrophobic due to the large presence of aryl groups. When water is added into the system, the PSf chains will be oriented in a way that the hydrophilic segments, sulfonyl and ether groups, are exposed which was induced by hydrophobic hydration [89]. This phenomenon triggers the aryl groups to be \"coiled up or hidden\" to decrease the enthalpy of the system creating spots of cohesion entanglement among the PSf chains (as shown in the insets of Fig. 8). Moreover, as stated in the previous studies of Kahrs and Schellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42], the addition of water into the casting solution could lead to interchain hydrogen bonding which can result in increased which can result in decreased solvent power and aggregation of the macromolecules which then induces the viscosity of the system to be enhanced. Therefore, as more water is added into the casting solution, more points of entanglement among the polymer chains are created causing the viscosity to be enhanced.',\n",
       "  'By taking the straight lines used to fit the curves of the log-log plot of the zero-shear viscosity and PSf concentration (Fig. 9), we were able to determine the critical overlap concentration and the critical entanglement concentration of the casting solutions without additive, and with 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% water. In Fig. 9a, in which no additive was additive into the casting solutions, we determined that the C* is 9.7 wt%, and no onset of entanglement occurred from 2 wt% to 18 wt% (it is probable that Ce would occur at higher concentrations). However, when 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% of water were added into the casting solution, 2 things could be observed: (1) critical chain entanglement ensued; and (2) both values of C* and Ce decreased with increasing amount of additive added. Correlating these values with the SEM from Fig. 5, we can infer that the addition of water has caused the onset of chain entanglement which evidently increased the viscosity which aided in the mitigation of macrovoid growth. Also, when the polymer concentration in the casting solution is higher than the critical chain entanglement, the initiation position of macrovoids shifted to somewhere below the membrane surface. Conversely, when there is no chain entanglement (PSf-D0), macrovoids are present along the cross-section of the membrane. In addition, when more non-solvent additive is added into the casting solution, the entanglement concentration was found to decrease (increased chain entanglement), suggesting that for a much lower polymer concentration, we can fine-tune the substructure of the membrane. This can provide positive impacts in terms of fabricating membranes at a more cost-effective approach.',\n",
       "  \"Aside from this, we have also analyzed the viscoelastic properties of the casting solution and how it is being influenced by the addition of water. Fig. S4 presents the graph of the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G'') as a function of angular frequency. The storage modulus is a measure of the elasticity of the solution and pertains to its ability to store energy. On the other hand, the loss modulus is a measure of the viscosity of the solution and pertains to its ability to dissipate. If G'' > G' the system behaves like a liquid while if the G'' < G' behaves like a gel [87]. Based on Fig. S4, all the systems exhibit a viscous behavior. When water is added, both G' and G'' visibly increased which can be attributed to the enhanced viscosity induced by the hydrogen bonding and subsequent chain entanglement [41].\",\n",
       "  'Aside from probing into the thermodynamics and viscosity of the PSf/2P/water system, it is also essential to investigate the kinetics of the phase-inversion process. We observed the movement of the phase separation front of the casting solutions with varying concentrations of polysulfone under an optical microscope as depicted in Fig. 10. As it was pointed out in the previous sections of this work, higher viscosity could slow down the kinetics of the mass transfer hence, when the concentration of PSf was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%, it was clear that it took the non-solvent a longer time to traverse the P15 system.',\n",
       "  'In fact, when comparing the position of the diffusion front as a function of time for different concentration of PSf in 2P without additives as illustrated in Fig. 11a, after 120 s of phase inversion, the non-solvent travelled a distance of 0.45 mm, 0.32 mm, 0.30 mm, 0.25 mm for P8, P10, P12 and P15, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 11b presents the related diffusion distance vs. square root of time plot.',\n",
       "  'Assuming that the dark ridges found after the interface corresponds to the initial diffusion position of water, then the diffusivity of water in the system (Dw/s) can be determined based on the equation proposed by Strathmann et al. [61].(2b)d2=4(Dw/set)(1-CW1+CW)twhere d denotes the diffusion distance, e/t represents a geometrical factor for the porosity and tortuosity of the membrane being formed, CW is the water concentration at the interface between the non-solvent and the polymeric system, t pertains to time.',\n",
       "  'Under the supposition that the concentration of water in the solution at the point of precipitation is small relative to unity so, equation (2b) can be simplified to the following expression (equation (3b)) to determine the effective diffusivity De. This De contains the geometrical correction factor e/t.(3b)d=2(Det)0.5',\n",
       "  'With the above expression, the calculated effective diffusivity of water in P8, P10, P12 and P15 are 3.23 x 10-4, 2.60 x 10-4, 2.51 x 10-4 and 2.08 x 10-4 mm2/s, respectively. Thus, verifying our previous claim that with higher viscosity, kinetics of mass transfer was evidently slowed down.',\n",
       "  'Next, the kinetics of non-solvent (water) in the PSf/2P/water casting solutions were examined and presented in Fig. 12. In P8 system, no significant trend was seen which could be attributed to the considerably lower viscosity of the system. Moreover, due to the low polymer concentration (8 wt%), the position of the system lies close to the binodal line, which makes it easier to become thermodynamically unstable. On the other hand, in P10 - P15 systems, it was evident that there is an increasing trend in the non-solvent kinetics when the amount of additive was increased. This was then further verified by calculating the diffusion rates of the non-solvent as presented in Fig. 13.',\n",
       "  'In 2010, Hong et al. proposed a model for the initiation of macrovoids based on the relationship of the initial position of the macrovoid (L) and effective diffusivity (De, which is similar to diffusion coefficient) versus the normalized polymer concentration(C/Ce) [39]. According to their study, the PSf/2P, PSf/2P/water (0.5 wt%), and PSf/NMP systems can be fitted into an exponential growth curve. Similar relationship is also observed in our PSf/2P/water system as presented in Fig. S5.',\n",
       "  'Although macrovoids permits fast permeability due to their high porosity, they are considered weak points in the membrane because they are prone to compaction under high pressure operation, which eventually leads to poor flux performance over time. From the previous sections, we have provided data that shows the by adding water into the casting solution, we are able to successfully mitigate the growth of these unwanted macrovoids. Moreover, we have offered in-depth analysis as to how the thermodynamics of the ternary system, kinetics and viscosity affect the morphology of the membranes. To further our study, we have investigated the effects of incorporating additives into the casting solution to help suppress macrovoids to the permeability properties and mechanical strengths of the membranes as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.',\n",
       "  'Since Figs. 4 and 5 prove that all of the fabricated membranes are suitable for microfiltration, we decided to investigate the pure water flux of the pristine and modified PSf membranes under a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar. Fig. 14 shows that even though the macrovoids disappeared, similar permeabilities are still maintained which could be due to two possible reasons: First, the additive concentration did not directly influence the surface porosity of the membranes having the same polymeric content. Second, although the huge macrovoids were suppressed, the interconnected pores along the cross-section still permitted fast permeation.',\n",
       "  'Meanwhile, Fig. 15 displays the measured modulus of elasticity of the membranes obtained from tensile stress/strain plots. At the outset, it is important to note that the mechanical strength of the membrane is in correlation to the concentration of the polymer. Therefore, it is obvious that as the concentration of PSf is increased, the modulus of elasticity also increased from 40 to 130 MPa. Besides, as we increased the PSf concentration in 2P, we were also able to prevent the initiation of macrovoid growth near the top part of the membrane and then the formation of the macrovoids across the entire cross-section of the membranes. This has led to the increase in the modulus of elasticity of the modified membranes. Additionally, we compared the mechanical strength of PSf membrane prepared with 2P to that of prepared using NMP (Fig. S6). As expected, the large macrovoids found in PSf/NMP membranes acted as weak spots which contributed to it having lower tensile strength.',\n",
       "  'To summarize, using 2P as a solvent allowed the easy fabrication of PSf MF (skin-free) membranes through NIPS process, which is deemed difficult to achieve using other solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc without the addition of additives. However, macrovoids are still present along its cross-section. The addition of a sufficient amount of water (which content is dependent upon the phase diagram) permits to totally suppress the macrovoids without sacrificing the pore size and porosity of the membranes. So, skin-free and macrovoids-free PSf membranes can be prepared using 2P as the solvent and water as a non-solvent additive. As the pore connectivity is maintained, so is the membrane permeability. But as the morphology of the cross-section is no longer asymmetric with large macrovoids, instead replaced with symmetric with continuous connected domains, the mechanical strength of the membranes was enhanced without waiving the permeability. These findings could help provide an easy and economical approach to suppress macrovoids without using expensive organic or inorganic additives, or using intricate methods to fabricate macrovoid-free membranes. Fig. 16 illustrates the short summary of these results.',\n",
       "  'To evaluate the viability of using non-solvent as an additive to suppress macrovoids, we have utilized other solvents such NMP DMAc and DMF to prepare polysulfone membranes. We initially established their respective ternary diagrams (Fig. 2 for PSf/NMP/water and Fig. 17 for PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water) to first identify up to how much water could be added into the casting solution before phase separation occurs. Based on the solubility parameters from Table 1, DMF and DMAc solvents are also considered good solvents to PSf polymer. This is also evidenced by the large homogeneous area of PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water ternary systems illustrated in Fig. 17. Moreover, the cloud points also revealed that it would take more coagulant (water) to induce demixing of the system.',\n",
       "  'In order to find out the versatility of the water as a means to prevent macrovoid formation, we have prepared 25% of PSf in NMP, 20% of PSf in DMAc, and 15% of PSf in DMF via the NIPS process. We have varied the concentrations of the additive from 0 to 3 wt% for PSf/NMP, 0-2 wt% for PSf/DMAc and 0-1 wt% for PSf/DMF casting solutions. The SEM cross-section images in Fig. 18 reveal that when water was added into the casting solution of PSf/NMP, the macrovoids were effectively suppressed. Similar phenomena were observed in PSf membranes prepared using DMAc (Fig. 19a) and DMF (Fig. 19b) solvents. These results prove that using water as an additive in the casting solution provides a practical and cost-effective approach to tune the morphology of polysulfone membranes from controlling the growth of macrovoids to its overall suppression.',\n",

The following major conclusions can be made:*The fabricated membranes are skin-free and fall in the microfiltration range.*The lower affinity of 2P towards polysulfone (compared to NMP) greatly increased the viscosity of the casting solution which prevented coarsening.

Though adding surfactants into dope solutions has been reported in many previous studies, their general focus has been on the effect of surfactant contents on the morphology and properties of porous membranes as shown in Table 1 with the influence of the amphiphilic structure of surfactants on MDWDS being rarely reported. Recent studies revealed that the surfactants at the interface of polymer solutions and water could facilitate MDWDS during NIPS, thus obtaining separation membranes with higher water flux [22,27-29]. For example, Guo et al. [22] added octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (OP-10, a kind of nonionic surfactant) into dope solutions and found that OP-10 at the polymer/water interface facilitated the diffusion of water into dope solution, thus improving MDWDS.

Nevertheless, the pore size and tensile strength of the membranes were compromised due to the research method was still the effect of addition amounts of surfactants on the properties and morphology of polymer porous membranes. This arouses extreme zeal for us to further modify NIPS-prepared porous membranes against enlarged pore size and lowered mechanical strength, and eventually improve the efficiency in the preparation process.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, we propose a method capable of improving water flux while maintaining the pore size and tensile strength of porous membranes via alteration of the conventional NIPS process. Aiming at MDWDS during NIPS, an amphiphilic interface via the addition of surfactants was created. The well-organized interface facilitated MDWDS across the interface (Fig. 1 (b)). Our previous study indicated that the hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic polymer and the hydrophobic tails of surfactants had great influence on the MDWDS process. Hence, we controlled other possible variables but only changed the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants [29]. The influence of the hydrophilic interaction force on the formation process of membranes prepared by NIPS was thoroughly investigated. This type of phase separation (PS) process with the assistance of self-assembled surfactant is herein called as surfactants assisted nonsolvent induced phase separation (SA-NIPS). Compared with the conventional methods to improve water flux, the addition amounts of surfactants is always 2.0 wt.%, which may have very limited negative effects on the pore size and tensile strength of porous membranes [21]. We believe that this study not only can help to reveal the key role of surfactants during membrane formation of NIPS, but also help researchers to have a deeper understanding of NIPS process, thus preparing a porous membrane with better performance.',\n",

Fig. 2(c) shows that the addition of surfactants is found to decrease the solidification time compared to PSF-O due to surfactant is amphiphilic which can improve MDWDS [22,27-29]. Interestingly, the solidification time further decreases as the IHN of surfactants increases. Surfactants used in the current work are hydrocarbon surfactants, that is, the hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic polymer and the hydrophobic tails of surfactants remains unchanged. The coagulation bath used here is tap water at 298.15 K. Hence, the only variable in this study is the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants, which may account for the trend in Fig. 2(c). This is because surfactants will directionally align at the water/dope interface with the hydrophilic heads toward the polar phase (water) and the hydrophobic tails toward the non-polar phase (dope solutions) to minimize the interfacial free energy. The surfactants attract water into dope solutions by hydrophilic interaction. This can improve the exchange rate of dope solutions and water during NIPS process. The hydrophilic interaction force between water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants is then altered as the hydrophilic heads of surfactants are modified [31,36,37], eventually affecting the MDWDS. With the heightened hydrophilic interaction force between water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants (i.e., with the increase of the surfactant IHN in Fig. 2(c)), the surfactants attract water into the dope solution faster and efficiently. Hence, MDWDS is further facilitated. Kinetically, it can be concluded from Fig. 2(c) that the solidification time further decreases as the IHN of surfactants increases.',\n",

This is because as the IHN increased (i.e., with the elevation the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants), the surfactants attracted more water into dope solution. This process opens up the dope solution interface (i.e., played a pore-forming role at the interface), thus splitting PSF dope solution into more and smaller PSF rich-phase. Hence, the MDWDS is further facilitated (Fig. 2(c)). This phenomenon normally increases the surface porosity of polymer membranes [28,29,38,39].',\n",

To support this deduction, ATR-FTIR spectra of the upper surfaces of the PSF membranes were collected. For all samples, there are no the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups at 3300 cm-1 in Fig. 5, indicating the remaining additives (surfactants and PEG) were cleared out.

The PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS displayed somewhat wider finger-like voids in the sub-layers in comparison with the virgin PSF membranes (PSF-O). The size of finger-like voids somewhat increased as the increase of the IHN. The phenomenon can be ascribed to the faster MDWDS during NIPS [23,29]. In other words, the size of finger-like voids somewhat increased as the increase of the rate of MDWDS (i.e., solidification time decreases in Fig. 2(c)).',\n",
       "  'Effects of surfactant IHN on the pure water flux of PSF membranes is displayed in Fig. 7. The virgin PSF membrane demonstrated the lowest pure water flux of 282 L m-1h-1bar-1 due to the dense upper surface of PSF-O (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that pure water flux improved with the increase of surfactant IHN as expected, which is attributed to the increase in surface porosity (Fig. 4). Compared to the virgin PSF membrane (PSF-O), the pure water flux of the PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS increased by a maximum of 2.9 times.',\n",
       "  'There are multiple techniques used to characterize membrane pore size, such as mercury intrusion method, bubble-point method, solute rejection measurements and so on [40]. Though pore size data generated from each of these methods is different, there is a common association among them. In view of this, bubble-point method and solute rejection measurements were used to investigate the influence of the IHN on the pore size of PSF membranes.',\n",
       "  'Fig. 8(a) shows that both BSA rejection method and bubble-point method indicate that the addition of surfactants into dope solutions and the increase of surfactant IHN do not markedly influence the BSA rejection and bubble-point pore size of PSF membranes. This is because the dominating factors affecting pore size of polymer membranes [28,39] are the kinds and quantities of the main pore-forming additives and the membrane material concentration, etc. In this work, the dominating factors are almost constant, and the only variable is the small addition (2.0 wt.%) of surfactants with low molecular weight (less than 1000 Da). This indicates that the surfactants in the work primarily function as improving the pore numbers of PSF membrane. The pore size of PSF membrane is mostly determined by macromolecular additives such as PEG. It suggests that increasing the IHN of surfactants can significantly improve the pure water flux of PSF membrane, but not significantly affect the membrane pore size.',\n",
       "  'For porous membranes, the peak of pore size distribution is close to the maximum pore size of membrane indicating the enhancement of the membrane sieving performance [28,29]. Fig. 8(b) displays the pore size distribution of PSF membranes, measured by pore size analyzer based on gas/liquid displacement method. The peak of pore size distribution located from 0.019 mm to 0.022 mm, indicating that SA-NIPS does not dramatically impact the pore size of PSF membranes. Specifically, the peak of pore size distribution shifted to the maximum pore size with the increase in surfactant IHN, indicating the pore size distribution of PSF membranes was optimized.',\n",
       "  'Porosity measured by the gravimetric method is negatively correlated with the mechanical strength of porous membranes [41,42]. Obvious increase in porosity can lower the mechanical strength of porous membranes. Hence, the porosity of the PSF membranes is investigated, and displayed in Fig. 9(a). The porosity of the virgin PSF membrane (PSF-O) was 85.7%, which was a little higher than that of the PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS. The porosity of the PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS showed no obvious change with the increase of the IHN. This indicates SA-NIPS does not affect the porosity of PSF membranes obviously.',\n",
       "  'Fig. 9(b) shows the elongation and tensile strength of PSF membranes. The tensile strength of PSF membranes did not considerably change. Several factors, such as the kinds and adding amounts of main pore-forming additives, membrane material concentration, etc., are known to influence the tensile strength of membranes [39,40]. These factors are kept constant in this work and the only variable is the addition of trace amount (2.0 wt.%) of surfactants with low molecular weight (less than 1000 Da). This further indicates that the proposed method solves the trade-off bottleneck in which increasing membrane flux by adding additives into dope solutions results in lower the mechanical strength of polymer membranes.',\n",
       "  'Herein, we reported that the membrane formation process of NIPS was successfully modified by adjusting the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of ionic surfactants for the first time, thus successfully preparing PSF membranes with more through-pores. Elevating the hydrophilic interaction force between water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants (i.e., increasing the IHN of surfactants) was conducive for the surfactants to efficiently attract more water into dope solutions, eventually promoting MDWDS during NIPS. This process increased the surface porosity and optimized the pore size distribution of the membranes. It was observed that the water flux of as-prepared membranes was significantly increased (up to 2.9 times increase, maximumly). Due to the addition of small amounts of surfactants with low molecular weight, the proposed method improved the water flux of PSF membrane without lowering the tensile strength and enlarging pore size of porous membranes markedly. Other testing results showed that the surface roughness increased slightly and the pure water contact angle was not significantly affected. This research on the pore-forming mechanism of surfactants is still in the preliminary stage, and there are still many shortcomings. However, it may provide some new ideas for the preparation of high-performance porous membranes.',\n",

       "  'In the last decades, wastewaters have resulted in a huge damage to the nature due to releasing to the environment with no suitable treatment. Hence, state-of-the-art and sustainable water purification techniques are necessary for addressing the water scarcity issue, producing potable water from polluted water, and saving the ecosystem from pollution [12,49]. The conventional treatment strategies proved not to be efficient for the elimination of pollutants. Membrane-based methods have shown a high efficiency while consuming lower energies than the conventional ones, e.g., distillation [13,48]. Nowadays, nanofiltration (NF) has been applied in different industries, e.g., wastewater treatment, as a promising route. It has proved satisfactory in separation and purification of different mixtures in a wide range of applications, e.g., food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, arising from its low investment cost, low energy demand and significant separation efficiency [27,50].',\n",
       "  \"In the recent decade, several phase inversion methods have been widely utilized the fabrication of mixed matrix membranes, including non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS), temperature-induced phase separation (TIPS), and vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS). Among them, the NIPS method is considered as the oldest strategy extensively utilized in the preparation of numerous polymeric membranes [4,7,8]. Nevertheless, it is well-known that this process leads to the formation of membranes with macro-voids [17,43], considered as a big issue in this field of study. Hence, the VIPS method has emerged as a new strategy to overcome this drawback. In this approach, during the exposure of the membrane to the vapor medium, because a slow mass transfer of water is occurred from the vapor phase to the casting solution, a uniform spongy structure is created in the membrane with no macro-voids [3,31,44]. As an example, it was reported by Su et al. that after the formation of polysulfone membranes using the VIPS approach, a completely cellular morphology was formed by applying a relatively long exposure time [19,24,51]. Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning that the coupled VIPS-NIPS strategy has been also employed in recent years to prepare novel membranes. In these systems, the non-solvent is often water, and so, the phase separation can be promoted via the water vapor transfer. The vapor's role is so crucial in the polymer precipitation, which is completed in the non-solvent bath [23].\",\n",
       "  'Polysulfones, which are categorized as thermoplastic polymers, has been widely employed in the production of the membranes for separation technology, arising from their low cost and ease of processing, and thermal and chemical stability [9]. Polysulfone (PSf) is an extensively utilized material for membrane fabrication while polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) is a relatively new polymer having extraordinary properties in comparison to the more frequently applied PSF and polyethersulfone (PES). PPSU provides superior impact strength than PSF and PES. It is also significantly chemical resistant, and shows a remarkably low rate of water absorption, making it appropriate for applications involving superheated steam sterilization and alkali washing. It also possesses excellent dimensional stability and superb resistance to high-energy radiation and heat. All these properties make PPSU a promising candidate for design of novel membranes [35,36]. Nevertheless, no examples have been reported of the application on membranes based on PPSU in industry, originating from its low flux. For example, pristine ultrafiltration PPSU membranes prepared using the NIPS method provide very low water flux of 0-10 L.m-2.h-1 at 0.1 MPa [29]. The low flux of PPSU membranes can be attributed to the restriction of the variation of casting solution composition because of low miscibility of PPSU with commonly utilized pore-forming additives (polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinypyrrolidone (PVP)) in aprotic amide solvents (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) etc.) [34]. Accordingly, it is an urgent need to modify PPSU membranes for the purpose of enhancing their separation performance, hydrophilicity and antifouling resistance for practical applications. One of the strategies to enhance membrane separation and antifouling performance is blending, which can be done through the introduction of hydrophilic water-soluble polymers and oligomers to the PPSU casting solution, surfactants, low molecular weight substances, inorganic nanoparticles, and metal organic frameworks [26,35,42]. The incorporation of additives has proven so efficient, which is usually done through the incorporation of three different types of additives: (a) inorganic additives, e.g., ZnO [41], SiO2 (Sonawane et al., 2022), TiO2[33], and MOFs [20]; (b) organic additives, e.g., PVP and PEG copolymers (Vidal et al., 2021; Falahati et al., 2019), GO (Tantiwatcharothai et al., 2020), MWCNT [45], and surfactants [11]; (c) additives as the non-solvent, e.g., H2O (Javanbakht et al., 2020), di-alcohols [28], and alcohols [30].',\n",

Basil seed, a tiny black seed which is native to different countries in Asia, i.e., Iran and India, is made up of three major components possessing various molecular weights, including polysaccharides (92%), proteins (2.37%), and uronic acids (6.51%) [33,41]. When the seeds are soaked in water, their outer pericarp swells into a hydrogel, which is called mucilage [32]. Because of the fact that basil seeds are easily available with a low price, the fabrication of each gram of mucilage is done by a lower price when compared to that of synthetic polymers [37].',\n",

Moreover, it is also obvious that strong peaks have emerged at 1158 and 1233 cm-1 in all the spectra, which are ascribed to the vibrational bonding of C-O-C and OSO, respectively, in the PSf and PPSU backbones.

Additionally, based on high-magnification images, the neat and modified membranes are also comprised of an open cellular spongy morphology, because in the VIPS-NIPS route, a slower absorption of water molecules occurs in comparison with the NIPS one, delaying the phase inversion process, and so, results in the creation of a sponge-like morphology [38].',\n",

When the pure water was replaced via the BSA solution in the filtration cell, flux of all the membranes decreased. The protein flux reduction compared to the pure water flux of the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 membrane was lower than that of the neat membrane, which demonstrated less fouling tendency of the modified membranes in comparison to the unmodified one.

Since conventional ultra-filtration (UF) membranes had too big pore sizes (0.2-0.01 mm) to retain dyes [1,12,13], and nanofiltration (NF) membranes had too small pore sizes (<2 nm)for dye/salt separation, tight ultra-filtration (TUF) (or \"loose\" nanofiltration) membranes with pore sizes between 2 and 10 nm were developed to have high efficiency for separating dye molecules from inorganic salts [1,2].',\n",

In recent decades, Nanofiltration (NF) has become the center of attention in separation and purification of aqueous and non-aqueous mixtures several applications including food, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and petrochemical industries, possessing the several advantages including flexible operation, low energy consumption, cost-efficiency and compactness of design [2-4]. It is noteworthy that the retention of dyes from water is considered as one of the largest applications in which nanofiltration membranes are utilized [5,6]. However, developing new membrane materials and exploring facile membrane fabrication methods, which are considered as the determining factors for the performance of the final membrane, are still required in this field [7,8].',\n",
       "  'In the phase inversion method, the mixture of polymer and its solvent are brought to instability through several means, including: non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS), temperature-induced phase separation (TIPS) or vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS). So far, the NIPS process has been widely used to fabricate polymeric membranes, including reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, microfiltration and MD [9,10]. Nonetheless, the membranes fabricated by using this technique are comprised of an asymmetrical structure with macro-voids [11], which is regarded as a drawback in this field. Accordingly, the VIPS technique can be utilized as a promising alternative to address the issues shown by the NIPS one. In the VIPS method, before the immersion of the membrane into the coagulation bath, the spread polymer solution is exposed to a non-solvent vapor environment, which is generally humid air, for a certain time. It is worth pointing out that the mass transfer of water is slow from the vapor phase to casting solution when the membrane is exposed to the vapor environment, leading to the formation of a uniform spongy architecture in the membrane structure with no macro-voids [12-14]. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that, through controlling the fabrication conditions, including exposure time and relative humidity, the membrane morphology can be controlled [15]. For instance, Su et al. reported the fabrication of polysulfone membranes by the VIPS method, based on which it was demonstrated that the membrane morphology changed from the bi-continuous structure to the cellular one with longer exposure time [16].',\n",

Accordingly, coupled VIPS-NIPS methods have been also utilized as a promising approach for the fabrication of membranes [18]. In this approach, a preliminary stage, in which the nascent film is first exposed to fixed humid air, precedes the immersion in the coagulation bath. It is well-known that in these kinds of systems, the non-solvent is usually water, and therefore, by the water vapor transfer, the phase separation is promoted. The moist air takes an important part for the polymer precipitation, subsequently accomplished in the non-solvent bath.',\n",
       "  'In recent years, Polysulfone (PSF) has been among the commonly utilized membrane materials, arising from its excellent properties including good mechanical, chemical and thermal stabilities along with excellent film-forming properties. Accordingly, Polysulfone is widely utilized for the fabrication of porous microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes [19,20]. Nonetheless, in spite of all the above-mentioned merits, Polysulfone membranes suffer from the tendency to be contaminated because of their hydrophobicity, which leads to declining of flux and lifespan of the fabricated membrane [21]. It has been demonstrated that the formation of mixed matrix membranes (MMM) can result in an enhancement in the permeance and selectivity of polymeric membranes [22].',\n",
       "  'Mixed matrix membranes are fabricated through embedding inorganic fillers, such as zeolites, CNTs, SiO2, etc. in a polymer matrix, which provides a preferential flow path for the target species [2]. Nonetheless, if defects present at the filler/polymer interface are removed, they might overcome the tradeoff between membrane permeability and selectivity [23]. In recent years, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted numerous attention as a promising alternative to inorganic fillers utilized in MMMs [24]. MOFs are a class of hybrid inorganic-organic solid compounds which are made up of continuous bonding of transition metals and transition metal oxides with organic ligands, forming 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D porous structures [25]. MOFs can provide a variety of excellent properties including flexible structure, high surface area, controlled porosity, tunable chemical composition, functionalizable pore walls, excellent chemical, structural and thermal stability, and affinity for certain molecules [26]. It is worth pointing out that the organic linkage existing in the MOFs architecture is capable of providing a superior affinity for polymeric matrices when compared to the above-mentioned inorganic fillers, which is much easier to control MOF-polymer interactions. Hence, the formation of nonselective defects at the filler/polymer interface can be successfully prevented [27]. For instance, Basu et al. reported that, by incorporating modified MOFs into a matrix of polydimethylsiloxane membrane supported on polyimide, dye rejection can be considerably enhanced, while no considerable changes is observed in the permeance [28]. In another research work, Dai et al. fabricated defect-free polyphenylsulfone/ZIF-8 core-shell microsphere membranes, in which the MOF microspheres not only prevented the formation of nonselective defects but also enhanced the SRNF performance of polyphenylsulfone membranes [29].',\n",

Additionally, the strong absorption peak present at about 1151 cm-1 is also attributed to the vibrational bonding of O = S = O in the PSf backbone. The absorption peak emerged at 1229 cm-1 also corresponds to the vibrational bonding of C-O-C in the ether group. Furthermore, the peak observed at 3049 cm-1 is also related to the vibrational bonding of = C-H in the aromatic ring of PSf backbone, and the two strong absorption bands appeared at about 1301 and 1318 cm-1 also shows the vibrational region of the sulfone group [31].

Moreover, the presence of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles is easily discernable on the surface of the M1, M2, M3, M4 samples with two different structures of sphere-like and rod-like. It can be confirmed that the more the amount of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles has increased in the composition of the membranes, the more the structure the nanoparticles has shifted from sphere-like to rod-like.',\n",

It is obvious in low-magnification images that an asymmetric morphology with finger-like structures has been formed in the architecture of the prepared membranes, arising from the use of high DMF concentration in the dope solution [31]. Furthermore, it is easily discernable in high-magnification images that an open cellular spongy morphology has been formed in the structure of the membranes prepared by the VIPS-NIPS method, i.e. M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 samples. It is well-known that, in the VIPS-NIPS approach, a slower absorption of water molecules takes place when compared to the NIPS one, which delays the phase inversion procedure, and consecutively, leads to the generation of a sponge-like morphology [34].',\n",
       "  'By drawing a comparison between the untreated membrane (M0) and the other membranes prepared via the VIPS-NIPS method (M1, M2, M3, M4), it seems that the size of the cells firstly increases and then decreases for M3 and M4 samples, based on which it can be concluded that the phase separation is initially faster and then slows down [35]. Through the addition of MIL-53(Al), an enhancement in the solvent diffusion velocity from the polymer matrix takes place, arising from the decrease in the interactions between the polymer chains and solvent molecules through the hindrance effect of the introduced nanofillers [36]. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that the viscosity of the polymer casting solution increases by the increasing the MIL-53(Al) content, by which the diffusion of water molecules through the polymer matrix is slowed down. The reason for this observation is that the increased viscosity of the casting solution plays the role of a physical roadblock for the mass transfer between non-solvent and solvent, resulting in a delayed demixing throughout the membrane formation procedure [2].',\n",
       "  'The surface roughness of the MNIPS, M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 samples was studied by using AFM analysis at a scan size of 5 mm x 5 mm, as depicted in Fig. 7 and listed in Table 3.

It was confirmed by AFM analysis that the roughness of the membranes surface have increased by introducing MIL-53(Al) to the membrane matrix. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the more the MIL-53(Al) content increased in the membrane matrix, the more the roughness increased. The \"valleys\" in the rough membrane surface lead to an improvement in the contact area, and therefore, enhances the water flux [37,38]. The data are in accordance with the water permeability of the fabricated membranes.',\n",
       "  'Contact angle analysis was conducted to study the surface hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes, as exhibited in Fig. 8. It is well-known that the higher contact angle, the lower surface hydrophilic nature [39,40]. Accordingly, it is discernable that both of the untreated membranes, i.e. MNIPS and M0, have the highest contact angles among all the prepared membranes, demonstrating the hydrophobic nature of the surface of the untreated membranes. However, after the addition of MIL-53(Al), it can be seen that the contact angles of the treated membranes have decreased. The more MIL-53(Al) was added to the matrix of the treated membranes, the more contact angles decreased, confirming the improvement in the surface hydrophilicity of the treated membranes.

       "  'The investigation of water Flux and dyes rejection performance of all the membranes was carried out in terms of the removal ability of MG, DY, CV and MB in an aqueous solution (Fig. 7). The membrane fabricated by the NIPS (MNIPS) method provided a much lower rejection ability when compared to the membrane prepared via the VIPS-NIPS (M0). Furthermore, it was found that the M2 membrane sample could provide the highest rejection ability among all the prepared membranes. It is also noteworthy that the M2 membrane sample provided the highest rejection ability for MG, with the highest molecular weight, and the lowest rejection ability for MB, with the lowest molecular weight. Additionally, water Flux of the M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4 membranes followed the order of M0 < M1 < M2 < M3 < M4, which can be attributed to the MIL-53 (Al) content in these membranes. The effect of MIL-53 (Al) on rejection and water Flux performance of the prepared membranes is schematically represented in Scheme 1. MIL-53 (Al) has proved to be a superb candidate filler for MMMs in aqueous solutions because of its permanent porosity, and great structural stability. The ordered porous structure and intensive hydrophilic surface of MOFs are essential for both the high dye rejection and the high-flux, because the homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles in a polymer matrix is able to provide additional small water passages along with an increase in the effective contact area of the prepared MMM to facilitate the channel of water molecules [27,41]. Moreover, the M0 membrane sample exhibited a slightly lower water Flux than that of the MNIPS sample, which can be attributed to its higher contact angle and denser top layer, which is in accordance with the literature [42]. Several membrane batches were fabricated to study repeatability, as listed in Table 4 (See Fig. 10.).',\n",

All these experimental results confirm that the antifouling performance of the prepared M2 mixed matrix membrane has been considerably improved as a result of the incorporation of MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles, resulting in exhibiting negligible changes in Flux through passing time. This enhancement can be originated from the effect of the incorporated MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles in enhancing permeation pathways for water.',\n",

       "  'Thin-film composite (TFC) membranes have been extensively applied in nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) owing to their excellent selectivity, high permeability and energy efficiency [1]. A TFC membrane has a thin selective layer on the support membrane which is composed of non-woven fabrics (NWFs) substrate layer and porous support layer. Generally, the performance of the TFC membrane could be influenced by regulating the membrane structure, the physicochemical properties and the special function of different layers. Numerous studies are focused on the selective layer owing to its decisive effect on the performance of TFC membranes [2,3]. However, the porous support layer and the NWFs can regulate the transport pathway of water and solutes through the membrane [4-6], which also affects the performance of TFC membrane [7,8]. With good mechanical strength, acid and alkali resistance and chemical stability [9], polysulfone (PSf) membranes which are fabricated by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method have been preferred chosen as support layer in many commercial TFC membranes [10-12]. The pore structure and morphologies of PSf membranes formed via NIPS are classified as finger-like pores and sponge-like pores, which are mainly influenced by liquid-liquid and solid-liquid phase separation or polymer precipitation rates [13-15]. In general, the delayed phase separation produces membranes with \"sponge-like\" structure, while transient phase separation produces membranes with large \"finger-like\" substructure [16-18]. Additionally, several studies have shown that an ideal support layer with thin sponge-like structure was much more beneficial in designing high-performance TFC membranes due to its withstand high pressures [19]. As known, the support membrane with finger-like structure, similar to other porous ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, had poor pressure resistance and can only suffer low pressure (~0.2 MPa) [20], which greatly limited its application in pressure separation, especially in NF or RO application. However, the support membrane with sponge-like structure exhibited better compressive performance and breaking strength than that of the membrane with finger-like pore structure, which was beneficial to be used as the support layer of NF or RO membranes [21,22]. Therefore, it was necessary to prepare sponge-like structure PSf membranes.',\n",
       "  'Currently, the research of the formation and morphology of support layer mainly focuses on the composition of casting solution [23-25], the composition and conditions of coagulation bath and the non-solvent additives [26], etc. Ismail [24] and Wang [25] et al. systematically investigated the influence of PSf concentration on the membrane structure. It was reported that higher PSf concentrations increased the viscosity of the system, resulting in longer phase separation times and gelation times. The thickness of the prepared PSf membrane increased, the skin structure was dense, and the membrane permeability was correspondingly reduced. Ali [27] et al. added ethanol to the coagulation bath to slow down the entry of non-solvents into the casting solution while preparing the PES support layer for NF membrane. Both the polymer precipitation and retarded phase separation were slowed down, which eventually resulted in the formation of sponge-like pores. Blanco [28] et al. studied the effects of coagulation bath temperature on the morphology of the PSF + SPSF co-blends supporting layer in NF membranes. It was found that the size and numbers of the finger-like pore structure increased as the coagulation bath temperature declined as the result of a lower diffusion of non-solvent in and solvent out. As a non-solvent additive, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) played an important role in the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the PSf casting solution, especially for its generated membrane structure. Han [26] et al. found that the viscosity of the casting solution raised significantly as the PVP content increased (PVP mass fraction >20%), leading to a lower rate of solvent/non-solvent exchange, which delayed the phase separation of the casting solution and inhibited the macro-porous structure of the membrane. Although extensive studies have focused on preparing PSf membranes with various structures, the influence of different fabrication parameters for PSf support layer with sponge-like structure is not systematically studied.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the structure and performance of porous support membranes are also influenced by different materials and properties of the NWFs substrate layer. Sairam [29] et al. used nylon woven fabric to prepare FO membrane. The results indicated that the coating solution penetrated into the fabric to form a defected low permeability cellulose acetate (CA) membrane. Conversely, a dense nonwoven could lead to a lower adhesion between the polymer and the fabric layer resulting in membrane delamination and defects. Goettmann [30] et al. found that using dense fabric in the film-forming process would lead to the delamination of the polymer layer. Additionally, Vilakati [31] et al. used two different materials NWFs of polyester and polyphenylenesulphide as supports to prepare TFC membranes, and they found that pure water fluxes (PWF) and NaCl rejections of the TFC membranes were affected by different NWFs materials. Tang [32] et al. systematically investigated the influence of fabrics properties on the morphologies and separation performance of the PSf membrane. The results indicated that PSf casting solution was easily infiltrated into the NWFs pores with low fiber density, which reduced the thickness of the PSf layer, widened the finger-like pore structure, and increased the permeation flux. Recently, Wang [33] et al. used two kinds of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWFs with different thicknesses to study their effects on the performance of the PVDF-gPEGMA UF membranes. They found that the PVDF membranes using thin PET fabrics had higher PWF than that with thick PET fabrics, which was attributed to the thinner and higher porosity of the PET fabric. To summarize, the polymer, the phase transformation conditions, the fabric characteristics and the interaction between these properties must be considered in the membrane-forming process. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies were focused on fabricating PSf membrane with sponge-like structure via changing PET substrates with different properties. Herein, the fabrication parameters, the fabric support properties and their influencing mechanism must be taken into account in the preparation of PSf membrane with sponge-like structure.',\n",

       "  'Initially, NWF-02 fabric was chosen to prepare the PSf support membrane. The effects of membrane fabrication parameters (such as coagulation bath temperature, relative humidity, pre-evaporation time, and membrane thickness) on the membrane structure were discussed. Relatively uniform membrane preparation conditions would be obtained eventually for preparing PSf support membrane with sponge-like pores.',\n",
       "  \"The effects of different coagulation bath temperatures (set at 25 degC, 40 degC, 50 degC and 60 degC) on the surface and cross-sectional structure of PSf membrane prepared by NIPS were investigated in this section. The membrane fabrication parameters of relative humidity, pre-evaporation time and membrane thickness were fixed as 20%, 30 s and 60 mm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the pore size of the membrane surface and the thickness of the skin layer increased as the coagulation bath temperatures raised. Interestingly, the cross-section morphologies of the membrane transformed gradually from finger-like macro-voids to short and narrow finger-like structure with dense sponge-like top layer, and finally formed uniform sponge-like structure at 60 degC. The solvents and additives continuously diffuse into the coagulation bath, while the non-solvent enters from the coagulation bath into the as-cast membrane in NIPS process [17,24]. The diffusion rates of solvents and non-solvent between the polymer solution and non-solvent interface determine the final membrane structure [45]. With the raising of the coagulation bath temperature, the diffusion rate of the two and the phase inversion rate were accelerated. Hence, a large amount of non-solvent entered the as-cast membrane, and the membrane was in a high swelling state, contributing to a looser and larger pore for the membrane surface as the coagulation bath temperature raised. Basically, the above diffusion rates are affected by the heat transfer rate and the mass transfer rate of the casting solution in the coagulation bath at different temperatures. When the coagulation bath temperature was lower than the casting solution's cloud point, the mass transfer rate played a dominant role in forming finger-like structure in PSf membrane. As the coagulation bath temperature raised to the cloud point, the cloud point curve would approach the polymer-nonsolvent axis. At the moment, heat transfer became the main driving force for the formation of the membrane, and the sponge-like structure was formed [21,46]. Therefore, the cross-section morphologies of the PSf membrane transformed gradually from finger-like macro-voids to short and narrow finger-like structure, and finally to uniform sponge-like structure as the coagulation bath temperature increased. Moreover, the solubility of hydrophilic PEG in the casting solution increased as the coagulation bath temperature raised, resulting in a lower precipitation rate of polymer and ultimately changing the shape of the macrovoids from finger-like to sponge-like pores [47]. In a word, the instantaneous phase separation was gradually replaced by the delayed phase separation as the coagulation bath temperature increased, which led to more sponge-like pores [48]. Therefore, the coagulating bath temperature of 60 degC was taken as the optimal condition to obtain PSf membrane with sponge-like structure.\",\n",
       "  'Adjusting the humidity of air can also be used to control the morphology of the membrane. The other preparation conditions were kept constant (coagulation bath temperatures: 60 degC; pre-evaporation time: 30 s; casting thickness: 60 mm). The effects of relative humidity of air on the morphology of PSf membrane were presented in Fig. 2. As the relative humidity of air increased from 20% to 30%, 40%, 50%, the pore density and the pore size of membrane surface increased [49]. Meanwhile, the cross-sectional structure of PSf membrane drastically changed from homogeneous sponge-like to a macrovoid, loose sponge-like. Specifically, the dense skin layer of the top surface almost disappeared and the cross-sectional structure of the membrane became a symmetrical loose sponge-like structure as the relative humidity increased from 20% to 40%. When the relative humidity increased to 50%, much more macrovoid sponge-like pores were formed in the cross-sectional structure of PSf membrane. By exposing the nascent membrane to humidity, the polymer precipitation rate slowed down, promoting a delayed exchange between the solvent and the non-solvent, giving rise to sponge-like pores structure. Furthermore, the mass transfer rate of solvent outward in the casting solution was greater than that of non-solvent inward in NIPS process, which was conducive to form dense surface. Conversely, if the mass transfer rate of non-solvent inward was greater than that of solvent outward, porous membranes tend to be formed [16,50]. Therefore, at the initial phase inversion state, the composition of the nascent membrane was most affected by the water vapor, and the mass transfer rate of moisture in the air diffusing into the membrane increased as the relative humidity increased, resulting in more porous structure on the surface and more loose sponge-like macrovoid structure throughout the support layer [51]. We aimed to obtain a PSf membrane with small pore size, a relative humidity condition of 20% was selected.',\n",
       "  'The pre-evaporation time referred to the time when the casting solution was exposed to the air before immersion in the coagulating bath. The pre-evaporation time was set as four gradients (20 s, 30 s, 40 s and 60 s respectively) to explore its influence on the PSf membrane structure while other conditions were maintained constant (coagulation bath temperature: 60 degC, relative humidity: 20% and theoretical thickness: 60 mm). As shown in Fig. 3, the pore on the membrane surface was smaller in size and less in number with the extension of evaporation time. Meanwhile, the macrovoids in the cross sectional structure were gradually replaced by uniform sponge pores, and the thickness of skin layer was gradually increased. Finally, a compact and dense skin layer was formed when the pre-evaporation time was more than 40 s. When the evaporation time was extended to the 60 s, the pore on the membrane surface was gradually reduced and the thickness of the skin layer increased further. The polymer concentration on the surface of as-cast membrane could be increased as the pre-evaporation time prolongs, and further affecting the membrane structure [52-54]. The above results also verified that the pre-evaporation time had an essential influence on the compactness of the membrane surface. The formation of the dense skin layer on the PSf membrane was caused by the increase of PSf polymer concentration on the as-cast membrane surface as the evaporation of the volatile solvent [24]. The increased PSf polymer concentration led to an increase in the degree of entanglement or interaction between the polymer molecular chains on the surface [55], which increased the resistance of the non-solvent to enter the as-cast membrane and then delayed phase separation occurred, and eventually sponge-like structure formed [56,57]. To sum up, we chose the pre-evaporation time of 30 s as the optimal condition for follow-up investigation to obtain PSf membrane with uniform sponge-like and thin skin layer.',\n",
       "  'The effects of membrane thickness on PSf membrane structure were studied in this section (coagulation bath temperature: 60 degC, relative humidity: 20% and pre-evaporation time: 30 s). A proper casting knife was used leading to membranes of thickness ranging from 30 to 160 mm (a:30 mm; b: 60 mm; c: 100 mm; d: 160 mm). As seen in Fig. 4, the thickness of the PSf membranes were 30 mm, 64 mm, 98 mm, and 161 mm, respectively. The pore size of the membrane surface became smaller and the cross-sectional structure transformed from sponge-like pores to finger-like pores as the membrane thickness increased. The surface porosity decreased with the increase of membrane thickness. The main reason was that the thickening of the membrane increased the mass transfer resistance, leading to the reduction of the solvent and non-solvent exchange rate. Therefore, the pore size and porosity of the membrane surface decreased [58]. When the membrane thickness increased from 30 mm to 160 mm, many more, longer and narrower finger-like pores formed, and also the thinner top skin layer and thicker bottom dense layer gradually appeared. The possible reason was that much space was provided for the growth of internal pore sizes as the membrane thickness increased [59]. Therefore, the finger-like pores growing-up step was then hindered as the space between the top surface and bottom in thin as-cast membrane narrowed (i.e. membrane thickness decreased), and then sponge-like pore structure formed. In addition, the PET NWFs were used as the support layer, it prevented the non-solvent entering the casting solution from bottom to top [32], and the bottom phase inversion slowed down to form a sponge-like pore structure [17,60]. Briefly, the scraping thickness was controlled at about 60 mm to obtain the PSf membrane with sponge-like structure with small pore size.',\n",
       "  'As stated above, the PSf membranes with much more, smaller surface pore and higher porosity could be prepared while the membrane fabrication parameters of coagulating bath temperature, relative humidity, evaporation time and the membrane thickness were 60 degC, 20%, 30 s and 60 um, respectively. Therefore, the above optimal fabrication parameters were expected to be selected for studying the influence of PET NWFs on PSf membrane, which will be discussed in the next section.',\n",
       "  'The surface chemical structures of all the NWFs were determined by ATR-FTIR spectra, as presented in Fig. 5. Some peaks corresponding to CO bond stretching vibration, CO bond stretching vibration, OCO asymmetric stretching and CH2 bending vibration were emerged at 1712 cm-1, 1240 cm-1, 1092 cm-1 and 721 cm-1, respectively. Based on the above results, the three NWFs were proved to polyethylene terephthalate (PET).',\n",
       "  'Besides the chemical composition, the morphologies and surface properties of all the PET NWFs (named NWF-01, NWF-02, and NWF-03) were also characterized, as shown in Fig. 6 and listed in Table 1. All of the NWF-01, NWF-02, and NWF-03 had uniform fiber thickness (Fig. 6). The thickness and the fiber thickness of PET NWFs followed this order: NWF-03 > NWF-02 > NWF-01, and the NWF-01 had fine and tightly packed fibers might with a lower gas permeability. This speculation was verified by gas penetration test, and some physical parameters of the PET NWFs were also presented in Table 1. The bulk porosity and the structural parameters were NWF-03 > NWF-02 > NWF-01 in descending order. Meanwhile, the air permeability of NWF-01, NWF-02 and NWF-03 were 489.19, 508.35 and 522.20 mm/Pas, respectively. It indicated that the airtightness of the NWF-01 was better than that of others, reflecting its higher degree of denseness. As known, gas permeability can be affected by multiple physical parameters of PET NWFs, which could be positively related to fiber diameter and bulk porosity and negatively to the thickness and structural parameters [61]. Although the thickness of NWF-03 was the thickest, its volume porosity was the largest, which led to lower resistance for gas transport path through it, ultimately resulting in a higher gas permeability compared to the other PET NWFs [62,63]. Additionally, the WCA values of the three PET NWFs were presented in Fig. 7, and the specific data were NWF-03 (90.55deg) > NWF-02 (87.09deg) > NWF-01 (82.19deg). Actually, all the three NWFs were polyethylene terephthalate (Fig. 5). Therefore, the roughness variation of the NWF substrate was the main reason for the difference in the WCA [64]. Fig. 8 showed the rough characterization of the three PET NWFs. Generally speaking, the greater the roughness, the better the hydrophilicity when the WCA was lower than 90deg. It can be seen that the roughness of NWF-01 (396 nm), NWF-02 (331 nm) and NWF-03 (314 nm) decreased successively. Therefore, the hydrophilicity of NWF-01 was better than that of other PET NWFs. In addition, the increase of roughness also affected the bonding force between the casting solution and the PET NWFs. The PET NWFs with larger roughness had greater adhesion to the casting solution [32]. Thus, the structure of PSf membrane would be affected by the PET NWFs with different hydrophilic and roughness, which would be discussed in the next section.',\n",
       "  'To further investigate the influence of the substrate hydrophilicity and roughness on the morphology and performance of the resulting PSf membranes, the above three kinds of PET NWFs were used as substrates to prepare sponge-like structured PSf membranes under the same optimal preparation conditions which were established in Section 4.1. The composition, preparation method and process of casting solution were the same as those described in Section 2.2. Subsequently, the properties, the PWF and BSA rejection for the three kinds of PSf membranes (named PSf-NWF-01, PSf-NWF-02 and PSf-NWF-03 membrane) were tested and discussed in detail. Herein, Fig. 9 showed the ATR-FTIR spectra of the different PSf membranes. Compared to the PET NWFs (Fig. 5), it could be seen that the stretching vibration peaks of SO2 group at 1584 cm-1, 1149 cm-1, and 1296 cm-1, the bending vibration peak of CH3 at 1487 cm-1 and 1240 cm-1 were appeared, which illustrated that the PSf membrane was successfully formed on the PET NWFs [65].The surface and cross-sectional micrographs of the prepared PSf membranes were presented in Fig. 10. It showed that all the PSf layers via a typically delayed phase separation produced membranes with \"sponge-like\" structure. The thickness of PSf-NWF-01, PSf-NWF-02 and PSf-NWF-03 membranes were 41.38, 42.78 and 64.03 mm, respectively. Although the top surfaces of all the membranes appeared to be smooth and porous, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane had the lowest surface average pore size (30.40 nm) and the highest pore density (9.77 x 10-3) (Table 2). To be specifically, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane showed a higher surface pore density and volume porosity than all the other PSf membranes, which was consistent with the higher hydrophilicity of NWF-01. During phase inversion, the PET NWFs offered a barrier for water intrusion to nascent PSf membrane from the bottom and then delay the solidification process, which was accelerated by the hydrophilicity of the PET NWFs. In contrast to the other PET NWFs, NWF-01 with higher hydrophilicity intensified the rate of the solvent/water exchange in the coagulation bath, resulting in a higher porosity of the resulting PSf membranes [57].',\n",
       "  'Finally, the PWF and BSA rejection performance of the three self-made PSf membranes and a commercial membrane (PSf-HT, properties in Table 2) were illustrated in Fig. 11. Specifically, the order of PWF was PSf-NWF-01 (463.69 L/(m2*h)) > PSf-NWF-02 (285.27 L/(m2*h)) > PSf-HT (243.13 L/(m2*h)) > PSf-NWF-03 (147.26 L/(m2*h)). The PWF of PSf-NWF-01 membrane was much higher than that of other PSf membranes. It was explained by that the PSf-NWF-01 membrane had a thinner thickness, a smaller tortuosity, a higher surface pore density and volume porosity (Table 2), which had a positive impact on the permeation flux. Additionally, the BSA rejections for PSf-HT (98.1%) and PSf-NWF-01 (97.58 %) membranes were much higher than those of other PSf membranes (<95%), the main reason was that the pore size and its distribution (Table 2) for PSf-HT and PSf-NWF-01 membranes were smaller and uniform. To summarize, the self-made PSf-NWF-01 membrane had the optimum performance among the above membranes.',\n",
       "  'Actually, the PET NWFs offered a barrier for water intrusion to the nascent PSf membrane which can delay the solidification in NIPS process, but it can be accelerated by the hydrophilicity of the PET NWFs, and then a thinner and porous PSf membrane could be formed. The increase in the porosity of membrane structure would open the diffusion path, thereby improving the permeability [31]. Many researchers proposed that PSf membrane with better structure and pore properties can be formed on PET NWFs with higher hydrophilicity, maximum roughness and compact fiber accumulation [31,32,66], which were also proved in our study. Based on the above results, PET NWFs with different roughness were considered to play an essential role in the formation of membrane morphology. As presented in Fig. 12, the capillary pressure of the three PET NWFs had a good correlation with the solid-liquid interface energy, while the water flux of the membrane was also closely related to capillary pressure and solid-liquid interfacial energy [67]. According to the Young-Laplace equation, NWF-01 with higher roughness and hydrophilicity had the highest capillary force owing to their higher solid-liquid interfacial energy and stronger binding force, which meant the polymer casting solution could be better absorbed by NWF-01 to form a thinner PSf layer. Thus, the gap between the PSf layer and the NWF-01 layer was narrowed and the transmission path of water was shortened with a lower transmission resistance, which contributed to a higher water flux. On the contrary, there was a larger repulsion between NWF-03 and PSf casting solution due to its higher hydrophobic, lower roughness and minimum negative capillary force. Therefore, the lowest adhesion between NWF-03 and PSf membrane resulted in poor performance of PSf-NWF-03 membrane. Above all, the increase in membrane thickness would effectively increase the length of the water diffusion path, thereby reducing the water flux [65]. It was concluded that sponge-like structure PSf support membrane with better pore properties was easier to form on hydrophilic PET NWFs with higher roughness.',\n",
       "  'To evaluate the anti-fouling ability of the PSf membranes, the BSA protein solution filtration tests were carried out, and the results were shown in Fig. 13. The decreasing amplitude of membrane flux in descending order was PSf-NWF-01, PSF-HT, PSf-NWF-02 and PSf-NWF-03. In the process of BSA filtration, the flux attenuation of the four membranes generally went through three stages: rapidly decaying in the initial stage (about 0-60 min), then slowing down in the middle stage (about 60-120 min) and keeping stable in the late stage (about 120-210 min). Such flux decay trends were also found in other studies [68]. The reason was that the adsorption of some protein molecules on the membrane surface at the early filtration stage, resulted in a rapid decrease in flux. Then, the fouling rate gradually decreased until the flux was stable in the middle and late stages, which was due to the formation of filter cake layer [68]. Additionally, the flux recovery rate (FRR) and fouling resistances (Ri or Rir) were important parameters to evaluate the antifouling performance of the membranes. As shown in Fig. 14, the FRR of the membranes were PSf-NWF-01 (88.59%), PSf-HT (88.29%), PSf-NWF-02 (87.29%) and PSf-NWF-03 (85.41%). Meanwhile, the values of Rir followed by PSf-NWF-01(11.41%) < PSf-HT (11.71%) < PSf-NWF-02 (12.71%) < PSf-NWF-03 (14.59%). Combining the previous membrane properties, it concluded that PSf-NWF-01 membrane with a higher hydrophilicity (Fig. 15), smaller surface pores and a smooth surface morphology (Fig. 10) leading to higher FRR and lower Rir, and also illustrated its higher anti-fouling performance. Correspondingly, the PSf-NWF-03 membrane was fouled easily, mainly because BSA protein molecules were easier to enter the membrane surface with large pore size. The increase of protein adsorption in membrane surface can aggravate the blockage degree of membrane pores and eventually lead to the deterioration of membrane fouling [69-71]. Overall, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane prepared on the higher hydrophilic PET NWFs not only had uniform sponge pore structure, but also had high PWF, rejection and anti-fouling ability.',\n",
       "  \"In this work, a series of PSf support membranes with sponge-like structure were fabricated by NIPS using three different PET NWFs as the substrate layers. The influences of membrane fabrication parameters and PET NWFs' properties on sponge-like structure PSf membrane with high performance were systematically studied. Sponge-like structure PSf support membranes can be obtained by adjusting the fabrication parameters while the coagulation bath temperature, relative humidity, pre-evaporation time and scraping membrane thickness were 60 degC, 20%, 30 s, 60 mm, respectively. Moreover, the fiber diameter, thickness, volume porosity, structural parameters, hydrophobicity and capillary pressure of all the NWF-01, NWF-02, and NWF-03 were characterized. The results showed that the hydrophilicity of PET NWFs was positively correlated with the performance of PSf membranes according to Young-Laplace equation, which indicated the adhesion degree between PSf and NWFs. Accordingly, NWF-01 had a stronger adhesion to PSf casting solution resulting from its higher hydrophilic, and then a thinner and porous PSf layer was formed. Hence, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane showed an ideal performance compared with other self-made PSf or HT commercial membrane, with PWF and BSA rejection were 463.69 L/(m2*h) and 97.58%, respectively. Moreover, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane also exhibited the highest flux recovery ratio of 88.59% and the lowest irreversible fouling of 11.41%. This work was expected to provide a reference for optimizing the preparation conditions of the sponge-like structure PSf membrane and selecting appropriate PET NWFs for manufacturing TFC membranes.\",\n",

       "  'The wastewater produced by manufacturing is harmful for environment and wild and human health [1,2]. Pulp and paper industry is one of the most polluting industry in the world, consuming more than 900 million m3 of fresh water and disposing around 700 million m3 of wastewater per year [3]. During the production of paper in a thermomechanical pulp mill, a process water (ThMP), mainly consisting of hemicellulose and lignin, is leaving the mill to be treated at a wastewater treatment plant [4]. However, hemicellulose is considered a valuable polymeric compound, and if recovered from the process water it can be used for other purposes. There are many potential application areas for hemicellulose, such as oxygen barrier films, food coatings, hydrogels or biomedical applications [5,6]. For these applications, it is desired to purify the hemicellulose from lignin and low molecular weight compounds such as extractives and salts. Membrane filtration has previously been selected as a promising pretreatment method of this feed solution [4,7]. However, the separation of hemicellulose using membranes is challenging due to membrane fouling related issues [8-10]. Membrane fouling results in a significant decrease in total flux, along with the possibility of a complete loss of operational properties. Therefore, it is of high interest to produce and evaluate membranes with antifouling properties for the filtration of ThMP process water, to contribute to the development and implementation of membrane filtration processes in large-scale industries.',\n",
       "  'Membrane hydrophilization is one of the widely used techniques for fouling mitigating. It can be carried out by coating [13] and grafting [14] as well as using hydrophilic polymers [15], co-polymers [16], oligomers [17] and nanoparticles [18] via blending technique. Both coating and grafting techniques require additional modification steps [19,20], that complicates the industrial production of membranes. Membranes modified via blending, e.g., by hydrophilic polymers [21], are often characterized by the washing out of the hydrophilization agent due to their affinity to water during the phase separation and further operation and are not effective for surface hydrophilization.',\n",
       "  'Surface modification is an efficient method for membrane modification due to the location of the modification agent on the selective layer surface as well as on the pore walls of the selective layer and the possibility of agent to directly contact with the feed solution, resulting in more efficient separation and enhanced antifouling performance. Antifouling membrane performance could be improved by reducing the surface roughness, hydrophilization of the membrane surface and changing the surface charge [11,12].',\n",
       "  'Polyelectrolytes are promising for membrane modification for improving membrane antifouling stability due to the presence of the hydrophilic and charged groups. When polyelectrolyte macromolecules are included in the membrane structure, they feasibly form a hydrated layer on the membrane surface and prevent fouling. Moreover, their ability to change the conformation, when external conditions are varied, makes it possible to impart surface self-cleaning properties to membranes. Membrane modification using polyelectrolyte solutions is often carried out by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique [22,23]. Polyethylenimine (PEI) [24], polyacrylic acid (PAA) [25], poly(allyl amine) hydrochloride [26], poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) [27], poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) [28] are often used for preparation of the selective layer of composite membranes for microfiltration [31], ultrafiltration [29], nanofiltration [30], or reverse osmosis [32] via LbL technique.',\n",
       "  'Membrane modification via the addition of the polyelectrolytes and hydrophilic polymers into the coagulant in non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) has shown to be a highly effective one-step method which requires no additional procedures [33-39]. It was reported that polyelectrolyte macromolecules added to the coagulation bath migrate to the surface of the nascent polymer membrane during non-solvent induced phase separation. Studies of the composition of the membrane selective layer revealed that polyelectrolyte macromolecules are mainly immobilized on the surface of the membrane selective layer as well as on the pore walls, but not on the surface of the bottom layer. This facilitates the formation of the thin layer of water molecules due to hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic groups of polyelectrolyte macromolecules immobilized on the selective layer surface which prevents the adsorption of the dissolved compounds during filtration.

Moreover, the water contact angle of the modified membrane selective layer was revealed to be 43deg, which was 20deg lower compared to the reference membrane.

It was found that polyelectrolyte macromolecules predominately immobilize on the surface of the selective layer and not on the bottom layer.

       "  'It was revealed that the absorption bands with the peak at 1153 cm-1 are due to the PSf R-SO2-R group symmetric stretching vibrations (Fig. 1). The absorption bands at 1583, 1487 and 1106 cm-1 belong to the vibrations of PSf aromatic ring (CC bonds) [44]. Peak at 1243 cm-1 is assigned to the vibrations of -C-O-C- groups bound with benzene ring of PSf [45]. Stretching fluctuations of S-N groups are observed at 2850 and 2965 cm-1. The absorption bands at 1650 cm-1 correspond to the vibrations of the S=O in carboxylic groups of PAA immobilized on the selective layer surface (2-6 in Fig. 1) [46]. FTIR spectra of the selective layer of modified membranes were characterized by the wide absorption band in the range of 3000-3600 cm-1, peaking at 3420 cm-1. These broad peaks correspond to the vibrations of the O-H groups involved in the formation of hydrogen bound of the carboxylic groups immobilized on the surface of the selective layer (2-6 in Fig. 1). This was the result of the immobilization of the polyelectrolyte macromolecules into the PSf membrane selective layer when PAA is added in the coagulation bath upon membrane preparation by NIPS. It was found that an increase in PAA concentration in the coagulation bath yields the increase in the intensity of the peaks at 1650 and 3420 cm-1 in the spectra of the selective layer surface (2-6 in Fig. 1). This is due to the fact that more PAA macromolecules were immobilized on the surface of membrane selective layer. However, no evidence of immobilization of PAA macromolecules was revealed on the surface of the membrane bottom layer (7 in Fig. 1). This finding is in agreement with the results obtained in our previous works [34,35]. This fact can be explained in the following way: polymer film was cast on the glass plate and then immersed in the coagulation bath, so membrane bottom layer is blocked by the glass plate from the contact with coagulant until the membrane will be completely formed and spontaneously released from the glass plate. In this system the selective layer is the first to contact with the coagulant during membrane formation via NIPS. The diffusion of the coagulant occurs in the direction from the selective layer to the bottom layer across the nascent polymer film. Absence of PAA macromolecules on the surface of the membrane bottom layer is due to the low rate of their diffusion through the formed less porous and dense selective layer across the nascent polymer film during membrane preparation via NIPS [34,35].',\n",
       "  'The effect of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath on the membrane structure is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The structure of the reference PSf membrane as well as the membranes modified by PAA consists of the thin selective layer, the transitional layer and porous membrane matrix pierced by elongated macrovoids. The reference PSf membrane was revealed to feature the porous transitional layer located near the selective layer and porous membrane matrix between large macrovoids (Fig. 2a). This morphology is a common structure formed by instantaneous demixing mechanism in NIPS. Addition of 0.4 wt% of PAA results in the change of the macrovoid shape: they become wider, shorter, some of the macrovoids become oval. The thickness of the transitional layer increased (macrovoids move farther from the selective layer); however, it remained very porous (Fig. 2b). It was found that starting from 0.7 wt% PAA in the coagulation bath and further increase in the PAA concentration the number of macrovoids decreases and a denser selective layer and less porous membrane matrix are formed (Fig. 2c-f). Moreover, the thickness of the transitional and selective layers increased with the rise of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath. It was previously found that the addition of the cationic or anionic polyelectrolytes (commercially available flocculants) based on polyacrylamide, Praestol 859 or Praestol 2540, respectively, to the coagulation bath does not influence the thermodynamics of the phase separation of the casting solution [34-37]. It was established that the key factor responsible for the change of membrane structure is a significant rise in viscosity of the coagulation bath. \"Solvent-non-solvent\" exchange rate during membrane preparation via NIPS decreased with the increase in coagulant viscosity. In other words, the in-diffusion velocity of the precipitant into the cast polymer film and out-diffusion velocity of the solvent out of the polymer film decreased [34-37]. Previously, it has been revealed that the addition of polyelectrolytes to the coagulation bath yields the increase in membrane formation time due to the increase in the coagulant viscosity [34-37].',\n",
       "  'In this study it was found that addition of PAA to the coagulant also leads to the increase of viscosity (Fig. S3 A, Supporting information). However, this increase in viscosity is rather small compared to the addition of Praestol flocculants based on polyacrylamide [34-37]. For instance, when 2.0 wt% of PAA is added to coagulant the viscosity increases by 2.2 times compared to water (Fig. S3 A, Supporting information). The systematic dependence of membrane formation time on coagulant viscosity was revealed and presented on Fig. S3 B (Supporting information). When 1.0 wt% of PAA is added to the coagulation bath membrane formation time increases by 1.7 times (from 7 up to 12 s); and when 2.0 wt% of PAA is added - by 2.9 times (from 7 up to 20 s) compared to membrane formation time when water is used as a coagulant. So, it was revealed that PAA addition to coagulation bath leads to the slight increase of membrane formation time due to not very high molecular weight. It should be taken into account that membrane formation time as determined in this study is a global measure of kinetic processes during NIPS and will not reflect all mechanistic details; what happens at the interface upon contact between cast film and coagulant is certainly not fully covered. A possible reason of structural changes of membrane cross-section is the immobilization of PAA macromolecules in the membrane selective layer, which leads to the formation of thicker and denser selective membrane layer. Upon the contact with the coagulant a partly precipitated gel-like selective layer is formed and further diffusion of the coagulant happens through this formed layer. The diffusion coefficient of PAA macromolecules through the formed selective layer is lower compared to the diffusion coefficient of solvent and non-solvent. Hence, it is expected that the depth of PAA anchorage in polymer matrix will be in the vicinity of the selective layer and concentration of PAA will significantly decrease across the membrane thickness. The evidence for this is the absence of PAA macromolecules on the surface of the membrane bottom layer which was confirmed by FTIR and discussed above.',\n",
       "  'It was revealed that PAA addition led to a decrease in a number of pores in the membrane selective layer and a decrease in the pore size (Fig. 3). This is due to the deceleration of phase inversion rate, caused by the coagulation bath viscosity increase. Pores of the selective layer of PA-2.0 membrane become so small that they can no longer be detected by SEM at the magnification used (Fig. 3e).',\n",
       "  'The topology of the surface of membrane selective layer was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is known that surface roughness of the selective layer has a great impact on antifouling membrane stability [47]. The surface roughness of the membrane selective layer was analyzed for the reference membrane (PA-0) and membranes with high PAA concentration in the coagulation bath (PA-1.0, PA-1.5 and PA-2.0) (Fig. S4, Supporting information).',\n",
       "  'It was found that the selective layers of modified membranes have a nodular structure typical of membranes obtained via NIPS. Further, it was shown that immobilization of the PAA macromolecules on the selective layer surface had only a weak influence on the topology and selective layer roughness (Table 4). However, it was revealed to be the minimum values of the roughness parameters, both average roughness (Ra, nm) and root mean square roughness (Rq, nm), for PA-1.5 membranes. According to this, the PA-1.5 membranes are characterized by a smoother selective layer surface.',\n",
       "  'Zeta potentials of the selective layer surface of the reference and modified membranes were investigated via measurements of the tangential flow streaming potential. It is known that zeta potential greatly affects membrane separation performance as well as antifouling resistance. It was revealed that the zeta potential was negative for reference and modified membranes over the entire investigated pH range. Zero fit showed that the isoelectric point for PA-0 membranes was approximately at pH 3.4, for PA-1.0 membranes it was at pH 3.3, for PA-1.5 and PA-2.0 - at pH 2.5 (Fig. 4). Hence, the isoelectric point was found to decrease with PAA concentration in the coagulation bath. Decrease in the zeta potential of the selective layer surface of the reference membrane with pH rise are explained by the specific adsorption of anions of electrolyte (Cl-) and hydroxyl ions (OH-) whereas PSf has no dissociated (negatively charged) groups [48]. It was found that the zeta potential of the reference membrane is lower in absolute value than that of the membranes modified by PAA over the whole pH range. An increase in the PAA content in coagulation bath and, therefore, a density of immobilized macromolecules (Fig. 1) yielded the decrease in zeta potential of the membrane surface (Fig. 4). It was shown that zeta potential decreased when pH increased, that is due to the ionization of PAA macromolecules (pKa of the PAA is 4.5 [49]). These results are consistent with the data obtained in [35].',\n",
       "  'A water contact angle characterizes the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface and impacts the antifouling membrane performance [34]. It was found that addition of 0.4 wt% of PAA into the coagulation bath during membrane preparation results in a dramatic decrease in water contact angle from 65deg for the reference PA-0 membrane down to 25deg. Further, increase of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath yielded the decrease in water contact angle down to 20-21deg for PA-0.7, PA-1.0 and PA-1.2 membranes. The rise of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath up to 1.5 and 2.0 wt% led to further hydrophilization of the surface of the membrane selective layer: the water contact angle became 17-16deg (Fig. 5). This is due to the increase in the density of immobilized polyelectrolyte macromolecules containing hydrophilic groups which was confirmed by FTIR analysis (Fig. 1). Carboxylic groups (-COOH) of PAA were solvated by the water molecules forming the hydration layer which prevents the absorption of proteins and colloid particles on the membrane surface [38].',\n",
       "  'Membrane separation performance depends primarily on the selective layer structure (thickness, pore size and porosity). The membrane pure water flux (PWF) was found to decrease with an increasing the PAA concentration in the coagulation bath (Fig. 6A). For instance, PWF for PA-2.0 decreased by 2.2 times compared to the reference PA-0 membrane. This is the result of the formation of a denser selective layer and a decreasing of the selective layer pore size and porosity, which was confirmed by SEM (Fig. 3).',\n",
       "  'The PVP K-30 rejection coefficient, on the contrary, was shown to increase up to more than 99% with the increasing of polyelectrolyte concentration in the coagulation bath, compared to 90% for the reference membrane (Fig. 6A). Decreasing of the pore size leads to the reduction of permeability of the PVP macromolecules and, therefore, to the increase in rejection coefficient.',\n",
       "  'Membrane separation performance was also investigated by filtration of the 0.5 wt% lysozyme solution in the phosphate buffer with pH 7.2. It was found that the addition of 0.4 wt% PAA into the coagulation bath resulted in a lysozyme solution flux decrease in 2.6-2.8 times (Fig. 6B). However, further increase in PAA concentration did not affect the modified membrane flux, and it did not exceed 13-15 L m-2 h-1. The lysozyme rejection coefficient increased up to 99% for PA-2.0 membrane. This was the result of decreasing the pore size of the membrane selective layer (Fig. 3). Another possible reason is the higher adsorption of positively charged lysozyme macromolecules at pH 7.2 on the negatively charged membrane selective layer surface. The latter factor could promote the electrostatic attraction of lysozyme macromolecules to the membrane surface and facilitate the formation of a gel layer of lysozyme, which served as a secondary membrane and increased lysozyme rejection during ultrafiltration (Figs. 4 and 6B).',\n",
       "  'It was found that pH of the feed solution affects the modified membrane performance due to the presence of PAA macromolecules on the selective layer surface and on the pore walls. It is known that the ion strength and pH variations cause the self-induced reversible conformation transition of the polyelectrolyte macromolecules: a stretched chain -- a globule. The degree of elongation of the polyelectrolyte chain coil increases proportionally to the degree of ionization due to the electrostatic repulsion of charged groups. Polymer chains in the stretched conformation probably covered a large membrane surface area thereby decreasing the effective pore size that resulted in a flux reduction.',\n",
       "  'The dependence of flux changes on the pH of the feed water was studied for PA-1.5 membrane (Fig. 7). Polyelectrolyte units immobilized on the selective layer surface and inside the pores, being protonated at pH 3, assumed the globule conformation and therefore did not block the pores. Consequently, the membrane flux was found to be the highest at pH 3. Further proceeding to the base pH region induced the ionization of the carboxylic groups of the PAA with the formation of the negatively charged carboxylate groups. Repulsion of similar charged groups caused the transition of PAA macromolecules to the stretched conformation and partially blocked the membrane pores. Thereby, the membrane flux was decreased by 4 times, in the average, at pH 7 and 9 compared to the flux at pH 3.',\n",
       "  'The reproducibility of results was demonstrated over three filtration cycles (Fig. 7). It was found that pH-sensitivity was maintained over the three filtration cycles. The increasing membrane flux in the second and third cycles was probably due to the washing out of PEG-400 from the membrane selective layer and pores. However, the pH-sensitivity of membranes was not lost. Thus, it can be stated that PAA macromolecules were strongly fixed in the PSf membrane matrix.',\n",
       "  'The influence of PAA addition to the coagulation bath on the antifouling performance was investigated during filtration of the 5*10-3 wt% humic acids (HAs) solution in tap water. The antifouling performance of the reference PA-0 and modified PA-1.5 membranes was studied. HAs performance and antifouling parameters (flux recovery ratio (FRR) and total flux decline ratio (DT)) as well as permeate characteristics are presented in Table 5. It was found that HAs flux of the reference membrane PA-0 decreased from 120 to 102 L m-2 h-1 after 1 h of HAs solution ultrafiltration, however for the PA-1.5 membrane flux was constant during 1 h of filtration -- 68 L m-2 h-1. Pure water flux of the PA-0 membrane after filtration of the HAs solution decreased down to 87 L m-2 h-1, while water flux of the PA-1.5 membrane was the same as HAs solution flux. According to this, the PA-1.5 membrane was found to feature significantly higher antifouling stability than the reference one. Better antifouling stability of PA-1.5 membrane compared to the reference one was attributed to the smaller pore size of the selective layer of the PA-1.5 membrane compared to the reference PA-0 membrane (Fig. 3a, d); lower surface roughness (Table 4, Fig. S4, Supporting information) and significantly higher hydrophilicity (Fig. 5). Moreover, HAs molecules feature negative charge at pH 8.4 [51]. It was shown that selective layer surface of the PA-1.5 membrane is characterized by higher absolute value of negative charge compared to the reference membrane (Fig. 4). This results in the better repulsion of HAs molecules and PA-1.5 membrane selective layer.',\n",
       "  'Based on the permeate characteristics after filtration of HAs solutions, it was shown that both PA-0 and PA-1.5 membranes were effective in surface water treatment, which usually contains HAs and fulvic acids (Table 5). However, it was found that the PA-1.5 membrane is characterized by higher iron removal from HAs solutions compared to the reference membrane, due to the electrostatic adsorption of positively charged iron ions on the surface of membrane selective layer of the PA-1.5 membrane with higher absolute value of negative charge compared to the PA-0 membrane at pH 8.4 (Fig. 4, Table 5).',\n",
       "  'Fig. 8 presents the fluxes during the filtration of ThMP process water and the permeances of the PSf membranes. It was revealed that PAA addition to the coagulation bath during the membrane formation led to an increase in the negative value of zeta potential and hydrophilicity of the membrane surface (Figs. 4 and 5) and a decrease in the pore size and porosity (Fig. 3) of the selective layer, which led to the reduction in the attachment of fouling substances.',\n",
       "  'The dependence of membrane flux during ultrafiltration of ThMP process water on transmembrane pressure (TMP) is shown in Fig. 8A. It was found that membrane flux increased with increasing the PAA concentration in the coagulation bath; only after using high PAA concentration about the same flux was obtained (PA-1.0 vs. PA-1.5). The enhanced fluxes can be related to an increase in antifouling resistance of modified membranes due to the substantial increase in selective layer hydrophilicity and negative charge that prevent the formation of the gel layer of dissolved substance on the membrane surface and the loss of permeability. In contrast, the reduction in PWF for the membranes with higher PAA content in the coagulation bath is due to the decrease in the pore size and porosity of the selective layer and increase in the thickness of the selective layer (Figs. 2, 3, 6). Thus, membrane morphology (especially pore size, porosity and selective layer thickness) is more influential on PWF than hydrophilicity, as reported in [50].',\n",
       "  'Membrane permeances using pure water were studied before ThMP process water ultrafiltration, after rinsing with deionized water and cleaning with an alkaline agent after ThMP process water ultrafiltration (Fig. 8B). It was found that initial permeance of the modified membranes is lower than the permeance of the reference membrane. This is due to the decrease in pore size and porosity of the membrane selective layer and increase in selective layer thickness (Figs. 2, 3). However, permeances of modified membranes after rinsing were revealed to be higher compared to the PA-0 membrane. Moreover, it was found to be 2 times higher for the PA-1.0 membrane compared to the reference one (Fig. 8B). Permeance was found to increase by 2 times after membrane cleaning with the alkaline agent Ultrasil 10 both for reference and modified membranes compared to the permeance after rinsing with pure water. Nevertheless, membrane permeance after rinsing and cleaning did not exceed the initial permeance value, which indicates irreversible membrane fouling.',\n",
       "  'Considering the results shown in Fig. 9, the flux recovery ratios suggest less irreversible interactions between fouling compounds in the feed solution and the membrane surface, especially for the membranes with high PAA concentration (PA-1.0 and PA-1.5). This could indicate that the enhanced hydrophilicity and more negative surface zeta potential of these membranes (PA-1.0 and PA-1.5) did not only improve the filtration fluxes of ThMP process water but also reduced the membrane-foulant interactions. In comparison to the reference membrane, increasing the concentration of PAA also resulted in an increase in the FRRs. Thus, PAA is efficient in reducing fouling accumulation on the membrane surface as most of the membranes with PAA are characterized by higher FRR compared to the reference membrane.',\n",
       "  'According to rejection results (Fig. 10), an increase in PAA concentration in the coagulation bath during membrane formation had practically no impact on the rejection of lignin, however, the rejection of hemicellulose slightly increased. The results of total lignin rejection for the modified membranes (Fig. 10A) were between 26.5% and 31.5%. The reference membrane, without PAA addition in the coagulation bath retained about 25.9% of total lignin.',\n",
       "  'The developed membranes were found to be more effective for the concentration of hemicellulose due to the smaller pore size of the selective layer compared to the reference PA-0 membrane (Fig. 10B). While the PA-0 membrane retained 91.3%, the membranes modified with PAA retained between 96.1% and 96.7%. The difference in retentions between hemicellulose and lignin also suggest the possibility to purify hemicellulose if these membranes are used for ThMP process water treatment in the pulp industry.',\n",

The effect of the polyelectrolyte concentration in the coagulation bath on the membrane surface characteristics (water contact angle, zeta potential, surface roughness), pore structure and separation performance was studied.',\n",
       "  'According to SEM studies, addition of polyelectrolyte into the coagulation bath led to decrease in the number of macrovoids and formation of a denser selective layer as well as decreasing the pore size and porosity of the selective layer. This is caused by the increase in the coagulation bath viscosity with added PAA and results in the membrane PWF and lysozyme flux decrease and PVP K-30 and lysozyme rejection coefficients increase.',\n",
       "  'It was shown that membrane surface becomes more negatively charged with PAA concentration increase due to the immobilization of PAA macromolecules on the surface of the membrane selective layer and inside the pores. Introduction of the PAA units into the membrane structure was found to enhance the membrane surface hydrophilicity. Modified membranes are characterized by the reversible pH-sensitivity; the PA-1.5 membrane was revealed to have flux at pH 3 four times higher than at pH 7 and 9.',\n",

For filtration of ThMP process water, the PA-1.0 and PA-1.5 membranes showed positive results both in terms of higher flux and FRR in comparison with the reference membrane and other modified membranes, without affecting the rejection of lignin and improving the retention of hemicellulose. The rejection coefficients of hemicelluloses of modified membranes increased compared to the reference membrane, which provides the possibility for the application of the developed membranes for the valorization of hemicelluloses from the ThMP process water in pulp industry.',\n",

       "  'As one of the emerging agriculture-based industries, natural rubber mills unavoidably produce a large amount of wastewater. The excessive generation of wastewater from local rubber industries results in severe air and water pollution, contributing to environmental damage. To address this issue, there is a window of opportunity to develop an effective rubber-laden wastewater (NRW) treatment. Commonly, NRW is treated using coagulation-flocculation [1] or biological treatment [2] prior to its disposal in the water body. Unfortunately, these methods generate sludge as a by-product that requires further treatment before discharging to the landfill. This post-treatment requires additional expenses, which contributes to an increase in operational costs for wastewater treatment.',\n",
       "  'In recent years, membrane technology has been widely implemented for water and wastewater treatments due to its technical applicability and outstanding removal performances as compared to other processes. The advantages of membrane technology include continuous separation, efficient and clean energy consumption, versatility to be integrated with other physicochemical separations, adjustable physical and separation properties, less chemical consumption, applicability for separating thermally-sensitive solutions (biological and organic solutions), and less sludge generation [3-5]. Particularly, membrane reactor technology has been extensively applied for many wastewater treatments [6,7]. A membrane reactor is an integrated technology that combines filtration and reaction processes in a single unit simultaneously. However, this method still struggles with limitations, including low pollutant rejection, fouling formation, lack of reusability, and poor durability [8,9]. New membranes with superior characteristics that can tackle those problems are urgently needed for membrane reactor technology. As a type of membrane reactor technology, the photocatalytic membrane became a popular method for treating wastewater that contains complicated contaminants [10-12]. The semiconductor materials as the photocatalysts are incorporated into the polymer matrix to synthesize the photocatalytic membrane composite [10,13].',\n",
       "  'Semiconductor oxides have been widely utilized as photocatalysts, such as tin oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), magnetite (Fe3O4), silver phosphate (Ag3PO4), tungsten oxide (WO3), titanium oxide (TiO2), cerium oxide (CeO2), bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6), and graphene oxide (GO) [14-22]. They have been applied for degrading pollutants, including dyes, organic pollutants, natural organic matters, and pharmaceutical substances [12,23,24]. Among them, TiO2 has attracted extensive attention from scientists and engineers because of its chemical stability, ease to activate, low toxicity, modifiable, and water-insoluble, showing promising application for wastewater treatment [10]. ZnO has a similarity with TiO2 regarding the photocatalytic characteristics such as similar bandgap (3.10 - 3.37 eV), UV light-driven activation, large availability, chemically, and thermally stable [25,26]. Previous studies reported that ZnO performed better photocatalytic degradation efficiency for removing organic pollutants than that TiO2, which was caused by the effective charge transport on its large surface area [27]. Nevertheless, pure ZnO photocatalyst usually exhibits low photo-sensitivity and a high rate of electron-hole recombination, hence, resulting in limiting its usability in large-scale application of the photocatalytic process. Theoretically, to achieve better performance of the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts, the electron-hole recombination rate should be maintained as low as possible.',\n",
       "  'Several studies to improve the performance of photocatalysts have been reported, including compounding, doping, decorating, and catalyzer carrier [27,28]. Those methods have been implemented to enhance the photocatalytic properties of ZnO. Constructing heterojunction structures on ZnO with other semiconductors to engineer the photo-sensitivity bandgap energy seems to be an effective method. This method can also reduce the electron-hole recombination rate and subsequently enhance the photodegradation efficiency of the ZnO-based photocatalyst. There are some materials that are widely used as complementary photocatalysts to construct the heterojunction structure, such as carbon nitride (C3N4) [29], reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [30], GO [31], and manganese oxide (MnO2) [28], WO3[32], and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) [33]. Some studies also investigated those noble metals (Au, Ag, and Pt) and transition metals (Fe, Cr, and Mn) can enhance the photocatalytic degradation of various dyes [34]. Amongst those, MnO2 has gained significant attention as a complementary photocatalyst, supercapacitor material, and lithium-ion battery additive. This is due to its immense natural availability, outstanding electrochemical characteristics, low bandgap energy, and high specific capacitance. By integrating MnO2 with conventional semiconductors such as ZnO, the photo-induced electrons of the semiconductor are transferred and captured by the MnO2 structure, which restrains the possibility of electron-hole recombination. The embedded MnO2 particles can also reduce the overall bandgap energy of the composite by inducing oxygen vacancies in the lattice structure of ZnO [35]. Moreover, the embedded MnO2 can also improve the photocatalytic properties by increasing the lifetime photo-induced charge transport and enhancing the charge transfer process.',\n",
       "  \"Furthermore, efficient photocatalysts should have a large surface area to provide massive active sites for photocatalysis. Silicon dioxide (SiO2) has been widely utilized as catalyst support for semiconductor photocatalysts [34,36]. The incorporation of SiO2 influences some fundamental characteristics of TiO2 and improves its photocatalytic properties [34,36]. Balachandran and coworkers reported that the specific surface area improved from 65 m2/g for TiO2 to 75 m2/g for TiO2/SiO2 composite [37]. Moreover, the addition of SiO2 into TiO2 improved the thermal stability of the TiO2/SiO2 composite, thus, inhibiting the TiO2's crystalline conversion from the anatase into the rutile phase [38]. Utilizing SiO2 as catalyst support also provides pollutant adsorption that brings the pollutant molecules closer to the active sites of the catalyst, thus resulting in a higher rate of photodegradation [39]. Due to these advantages, SiO2 was selected as the catalyst support to enhance the photocatalytic ability of the synthesized ZnO-MnO2 catalyst.\",\n",
       "  \"Basically, performing photocatalytic properties on the membrane's surface can provide a simultaneous filtration and photocatalytic process at a single time. Furthermore, the membrane process is susceptible to fouling formation; therefore, performing the photocatalytic process on the membrane's surface can also prevent fouling formation by degrading the attached foulants with the generated radical molecules, which can provide overall membrane performance improvements. In this present study, the MnO2 doping into ZnO with SiO2 as the matrix (ZnO-MnO2@SiO2) composite was synthesized via the sol-gel process, and the membranes were prepared using the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The synthesized photocatalyst composite was expected to improve the photocatalytic activity, hydrophilicity, and antifouling performance of the modified PSf membrane. Based on our review, none has conducted the study regarding synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation of the UV light-driven photocatalytic PSf membrane incorporated by ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite as the photocatalyst for simultaneous membrane filtration and photocatalytic process for NRW treatment. This study explored, evaluated, and compared the membrane performance in dark conditions and under UV light exposure. The photodegradation performance, photocatalytic degradation kinetics, effects of scavengers, and photocatalytic mechanisms of the membranes were also investigated. Therefore, this study can provide a better option for enhancing photocatalysts activity to improve the overall membrane performance, which can prolong the membrane's lifetime for a reliable method of NRW treatment.\",\n",

The NRW sample was renewed to assure that the initial pollutant condition was the same in every cycle experiment.\",\n",
       "  'Using a resistance in series model, the resistance during filtration was assessed. The model considers all types of membrane fouling resistance, including intrinsic resistance (Rm), adsorption resistance (Ra), deposition resistance (Rd), and concentration polarization (Rcp), as the complete formula are shown in Eqs. (8)-(11), respectively [46].(8)Rm=DPexJi(9)Ra=DPexJa-Rm(10)Rd=DPexJf-Rm-Ra(11)Rcp=DPexJv-Rm-Ra-RdWhere DP is the trans-membrane pressure (Pa), e is pure water viscosity (Pa.s), Ji, Ja, Jf, and Jv are the initial membrane pure water flux (PWF) (L.m-2h-1), the measured PWF after fouled by static adsorption (L.m-2h-1), the PWF after fouled by actual NRW (L.m-2h-1), and the measured flux when operating in actual NRW filtration (L.m-2h-1), respectively.',\n",
       "  'The effect of UV irradiation on composite membranes for producing photocatalytic activity can also be ascribed to the reduction of membrane fouling which is known as the antifouling properties. The total fouling ratio (RT), reversible fouling ratio (RR), irreversible fouling ratio (RIr), and flux recovery ratio (FRR) of the fabricated membranes were measured as the mathematical formula are given in Eqs. (12)-(15), respectively [46].(12)RT=Ji-JwJcx100%(13)RR=Jc-JwJix100%(14)RIr=Ji-JcJix100%(15)FRR=JcJix100%Where Ji, Jc, and Jw are the initial PWF (L.m-2h-1), PWF after cleaning (L.m-2h-1), and the permeate flux of wastewater (L.m-2h-1), respectively.',\n",
       "  'Several analyses were performed to characterize the prepared photocatalyst composites. Fig. 2(a) depicts the micromorphology of the prepared ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. The irregular structure dominates the micromorphology of this composite. Some aggregations can still be observed in the SEM image. This possibly occurred due to the high tendency of tiny particles to stick with others [47]. The elemental and oxide composition of the as-synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite were characterized using EDX, and the results are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that the composite mainly consisted of 24.13 %, 13.10 %, and 15.14 % of SiO2, ZnO, and MnO2, respectively, with low content of impurities such as sodium (Na) and copper (Cu) with compositions of 0.13 % and 0.81 %, respectively. The recorded Na and Cu compositions can be promoted by the tiny amount of Na and Cu in the SiO2 as the matrix material of the composite. Since the content is not significant, the negative impacts of the Na and Cu presence on the photocatalytic properties of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 can be neglected. The detected significant Zn and Mn signals in the EDX results revealed that the doping of ZnO and MnO2 into the SiO2 matrix was successful. Fig. 2(b) shows the particle size distribution of the synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. This composite has various sizes of particle that distribute from 20 to 180 nm, and particle size of 60-80 nm dominates the distribution. It is also found that the average size of the composite is 78.54 nm. Smaller particle size is possible to facilitate a larger surface area of the active sites, thus can generate better photocatalytic performance. FTIR analysis was used to characterize the contained functional groups of the composite, as the results are compiled in Fig. 2(c). In all spectra, the fingerprint region that corresponds to the metal oxide bonds is observed at the wavenumber of 600 to 400 cm-1[48]. Moreover, a broad absorption peak at 1000 cm-1 that can be observed in the spectra of pristine MnO2 and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite indicates the presence of Mn-O bonds [28]. A sharp peak at around 500 cm in ZnO and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite correlates to the presence of Zn-O bonds [48]. These observed peaks that correspond to the presence of Zn-O and Mn-O groups in the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite indicate success attachments of ZnO and MnO2 in the composite.',\n",
       "  \"To further understand the characteristics of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite, an XRD analysis was carried out. XRD results present the diffractograms that correlate with the crystalline structure of the tested samples. Fig. 2(d) reflects the diffractograms of SiO2, ZnO, MnO2, and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. Based on the results, it is found that SiO2 and MnO2 seem to have an amorphous structure. Despite this, SiO2 show two sharp peaks at 33.21deg and 45.63deg that indicate the crystallite of SiO2[49]. Some small peaks are also observed in the diffractogram of MnO2, which closely correlates to the birnessite crystal phase of MnO2[27]. In contrast, the diffractogram of ZnO shows a lot of significant peaks. The peaks in the ZnO's diffraction pattern can be related to the wurtzite crystal structure phase based on the card number of JCPDS No. 0036-1451. Moreover, the XRD pattern of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite is dominantly attributed to that of ZnO, with also contains the patterns of MnO2 and SiO2, which signifies the coexistence of ZnO and MnO2 crystallite sites. This indicates the successful formation of the heterostructure of the composite [50]. It is also found that the peak intensity of standard ZnO is reduced in the synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite, which is caused by the more intense reflections due to the entrapped other oxides (MnO2 and SiO2) in the ZnO structures. This phenomenon corresponds to the formation of the heterostructure in the photocatalyst composite. Overall, the XRD results agree well with the previous FTIR results to support the successful doping of ZnO and MnO2 in the photocatalyst.\",\n",
       "  \"BET-BJH analysis was used to show the sorption properties of the photocatalysts and their specific surface area, as shown in Fig. 2(e). Based on the results, the sorption isotherms of N2 for all photocatalysts are attributed as type IV with H3 hysteresis loop characteristics [51]. It suggests that the pore characteristics of all samples can be classified as mesoporous material, indicated by the quite noticeable envelope shape in the hysteresis loops. The mesoporous material has a pore size of 2-50 nm, which is usually associated with the detected pores as the gaps between nanoparticles. Furthermore, the BET surface areas of the photocatalysts were 182, 207, and 254 m2/g for ZnO, MnO2, and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. This result indicates that the synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite has the largest BET surface area among others, which correlated to the utilization of SiO2 as the composite's matrix, thus providing a larger surface area. These findings are also in a similar shape to previously reported studies that also used SiO2 as the catalysts support [52]. The larger surface area of a photocatalyst might provide massive active sites for the photocatalytic process and enhance the degradation performance. The surface area also plays a crucial role in pollutant adsorption prior the photocatalytic degradation.\",\n",
       "  'The DRS analysis was performed to understand the light absorption behavior of the photocatalysts under UV-vis spectra. Fig. 2(f) depicts the response of the photocatalysts to light absorbance upon irradiation of UV-vis spectra. It can be seen that each sample shows a different response trend. SiO2 seems to not have an active light absorption either in UV or visible regions. ZnO shows a significant absorbance in the UV region, while MnO2 presents an active behavior in the visible light region. Meanwhile, the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite shows the light absorption activity in a region between pristine ZnO and MnO2. However, by looking it closer, the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite has the highest absorption of the light spectrum in a wavelength of around 350 nm, which is still in the UV light region. Therefore, the photocatalytic experiment should be performed using UV light irradiation instead of visible light irradiation. The bandgap energies of the photocatalysts were estimated using the Tauc plots, as depicted in Fig. 2(g). It can be observed that SiO2 has an undetected bandgap value, as previously suggested by the DRS results. Previous works reported that SiO2 has extremely high bandgap energy with approximately 5.00 eV [39]; thus, it cannot be estimated using standard light spectra of 250-700 nm. Pristine ZnO has a bandgap energy of 3.10 eV, indicating that the photocatalytic process should be performed under UV light conditions. Pristine MnO2 shows a bandgap of 2.20 eV, as shown by the significant light absorption in the visible light region. The ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite has a bandgap value of 2.65 eV, which is lower than that of pristine ZnO and SiO2 but higher than the pristine MnO2. This reduction of the bandgap value of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite is desirable and is reasonably caused by the incorporation of MnO2. However, despite the fact that the pristine MnO2 has the lowest bandgap energy, it does not reflect the best photocatalytic properties. It is due to a single element photocatalyst tends to have a higher electron-hole recombination rate, which is not satisfying [53]. Indeed, the main goal of MnO2 integration into the composite is to reduce the bandgap energy of the composite by inducing the oxygen vacancies in the lattice structure of ZnO and creating the heterojunction photocatalytic mechanism to reduce the electron-hole recombination [35]. This finding suggests that the doping of MnO2 into ZnO can influence the light absorption behavior of the synthesized composite and result in lower bandgap energy. The lower bandgap energy indicates that the photocatalyst requires lower photon energy to perform the photocatalysis, thus can improve the photocatalytic performance of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite.',\n",
       "  \"The surface and cross-sectional images of the neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes are compiled in Fig. 3. Based on the results in Fig. 3(a), it is found that the surface morphology of the neat PSf is relatively smooth, with some defects spotted. These defects might be formed due to different coagulation rates of polysulfone in the defect spots compared to the whole membrane surface during the phase inversion process. The embedded photocatalysts, i.e., ZnO, MnO2, and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, on the surface of the modified membranes are observed, as shown in Fig. 1(b-d), respectively. The photocatalysts appear as tiny dots across the membranes' surface. The embedded photocatalyst on the membrane surface will become active under UV light irradiation to perform the photocatalytic process for pollutant degradations. For the cross-sectional structure, the neat PSf membrane attributed a sponge-like structure with spotted microvoid structures. This sponge-like structure reflects a low membrane's porosity due to a denser structure. It is found that the cross-sectional morphologies of the modified membranes with photocatalysts are significantly different from that of the neat PSf. The modified membranes attributed a similar finger-like structure to their cross-sectional morphologies. The finger-like structure is a typical characteristic of the cross-sectional morphology of membranes that are prepared using the NIPS method [54]. The finger-like structure formed right after the coagulation process, which separated the solvent and polymer. Polymer rich phase turned into a membrane matrix, whereas solvent rich phase turned into membrane pores that were usually in the form of finger-like structure. It is also found that PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 have fine constructed finger-like structures. It can be seen that the modified membranes with photocatalysts have a more massive pore structure compared to the neat PSf membrane. The massive pore structure possibly leads to creating higher membrane porosity, water uptake, and permeability [55]; thus, the modified membranes can perform better filtration performance. The embedded photocatalysts are found in the pore structure of the modified membranes, which is desirable to enhance membrane hydrophilicity. The synergetic effects of photocatalysts on the membrane's surface, the finger-like structure, and embedded photocatalysts in the membrane's pore structure are helpful in generating a significant improvement in the filtration process.\",\n",
       "  \"To characterize the membranes' compositions, EDX analysis was performed, as the chemical compositions of neat PSf and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 are collected in Table 4. From the results, it is found that the neat PSf membrane is composed of 83.45 % of carbon (C), 11.09 % of oxygen (O), and 5.46 % of sulfur (S). Meanwhile, after the addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite into the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, the membrane's composition significantly changed. Some new elementals are found in the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane's composition, including silicon (Si), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) with compositions of 0.22 %, 0.52 %, 0.34 %, and 0.06 %, respectively. These newly recorded elementals have correlations with the oxide compositions that contained the key oxide substances, i.e., SiO2, ZnO, and MnO2. These new recorded compounds also reflect that the addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst into the membrane was successful. Another essential piece of information from the EDX analysis is that the oxygen composition in the membrane increased after the addition of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst, meaning that the modified membrane contains richer oxygenated compounds. The rich oxygenated compounds on the membrane surface can enhance the membrane's hydrophilicity that leading to permeability improvement. In addition, the interfacial interaction between PSf and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst is physical interaction that has a similar photocatalyst-polymer interaction with other reported studies [46,56,57]. Photocatalyst particles are attached physically to the matrix of PSf. It is obvious from the SEM images of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are no side reactions between photocatalyst and PSf matrix.\",\n",
       "  \"Furthermore, EDX mapping distribution characterization is used to show the key elemental distribution in the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Fig. 4(a-f) reflect the elemental distributions of C, O, S, Zn, Mn, and Si, respectively. The dense distribution of C, O, and S confirms that the membrane is constructed by polysulfone, which is consisted of C, O, and S, as previously presented in Table 4. Furthermore, it can be seen that the elemental distributions across the membrane's surface are dispersed uniformly. The combined distribution of Zn, Mn, and Si also shows the remarkably well-dispersed elemental distribution, as represented in Fig. 4(g-h). The prominent dispersion of photocatalysts on the membrane surface can prevent particle aggregations. In this study, the photocatalyst dispersion is obtained by performing a constant agitation and conducting a 60,000 Hz ultrasonic homogenizer prior to the membrane casting. The ultrasonic waves are responsible for making the photocatalyst's dispersion in the dope solution, hence, preventing the agglomeration of the photocatalyst's particles. In the conventional membrane filtration, uniformly distributed photocatalyst on the membrane's surface controlled the surface hydrophilicity, while in the photocatalytic filtration, the uniform photocatalyst distribution also provides more extensive availability of active sites across the membrane's surface to boost the photodegradation of the pollutants. This photodegradation mechanism on the membrane's surface is helpful in fouling mitigation, thus, can improve the membrane's performance and durability.\",\n",
       "  \"AFM analysis was used to investigate the surface roughness of the neat PSf and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, as the results are presented in Fig. 5. The brighter region on the images reflects the relatively higher area, whereas the darker region means vice-versa. In two-dimension surface profiles, some quantitative properties are estimated, including the average surface roughness (Sa), root mean square of height data (Sq), and the height difference between the lowest and the highest peak (Sz). It can be seen that the neat PSf membrane attributed to a relatively smooth surface with 0.473 nm in Sa and 7.21 in Sz. In contrast, the modified PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane shows a rougher surface with a Sa value of 1.70 nm and Sz value of 31.7 nm, which is approximately 3.5 times rougher surface than that of the neat PSf membrane, as shown in the three-dimensional AFM images (right side). The increment in surface roughness can be caused by the relative porosity of the membrane and a change of interaction between solvent and non-solvent in the presence of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite. A membrane with a rougher surface possesses a larger filtration area [58]; thus, it can increase the membrane's permeability. The rougher membrane surface also reflects the presence of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalysts. The peak distribution is distributed uniformly, as it agrees well with the EDX mapping results and also indicates the massive availability of the active sites to perform the photocatalytic process.\",\n",
       "  \"The crystalline structure of the neat PSf and modified PSf membranes with embedded photocatalysts were characterized using XRD analysis, as the results are represented in Fig. 6. It is found that the diffractogram patterns of all membranes show a similar pattern as the neat PSf. The patterns of all membranes exhibit a broad peak around diffraction angle from 15deg to 20deg [59]. This broad peak is a typical peak indicating the polysulfone polymer's backbone. The neat PSf membrane possesses a smooth diffractogram pattern without any distinct peaks, indicating that the neat PSf membrane is constructed by an amorphous polymer structure that is free from any crystal structure. Meanwhile, the modified membranes with photocatalysts addition demonstrate some tiny peaks on their diffractogram patterns, suggesting the presence of some crystallite sites from the photocatalysts on the polymer structures. For example, the diffractogram of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exhibits some tiny peaks at diffractogram angles of 31deg and 37deg that indicate the crystallite sites of ZnO, and a peak at 49deg signifies the crystallite of MnO2[27,28]. The observed weak tiny peaks can be associated with the uniformly dispersed photocatalyst across the membrane; thus, the detected peaks were not entirely prominent. This finding is supported by the EDX mapping results, as previously discussed.\",\n",
       "  'FTIR analysis was performed to analyze the developed functional groups in the fabricated membranes over a frequency range of 4000-450 cm-1. The FTIR spectra for the neat PSf and modified PSf membranes with embedded photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 7. It can be visually observed that all the FTIR spectra of the membranes have a similar pattern, meaning that the membranes were constructed with the same polymer. The observed peaks consistently reflect the typical functional groups of polysulfone, such as a peak at 1585 cm-1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of CH groups, and peaks at 1448 and 1241 cm-1 that belong to the stretching vibrations of OS = O groups of polysulfone [42]. From FTIR spectrum of M-04, which is PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, shows notable small peaks at 2974 and 1074 cm-1, which correspond to the Zn-O and Mn-O bonds, respectively, confirming the existence of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite.',\n",
       "  \"Pore properties characterization is important to evaluate the effect of photocatalyst loading on the physical properties of the fabricated membranes. Evaluations of thickness, porosity, and average pore size of the membranes are essential because these parameters cause some influences on the permeability, sorption of water, selectivity, and even the fouling tendency of the fabricated membranes [55]. Table 5 summarizes the results regarding the pore properties of the membranes. It is found that the photocatalysts doping increased the thickness of the fabricated membranes, from 35.43 um for the neat PSf to 46.31, 43.70, and 45.83 um for PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2. This can be caused by the swelling effects in the polymer structure of the membranes upon the addition of photocatalysts, thus, resulting in thicker membrane layers. The porosity parameter shows a similar trend with the thickness. The porosity of the membranes significantly increased with the addition of photocatalysts, from 42.16 % for the neat PSf to 63.13, 56.33, and 72.31 % for PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. The higher porosity of the modified membranes is promoted by the creation of void sites in the membrane body when phase inversion occurs. The photocatalysts are helpful in creating more gaps in the membrane body during phase inversion. These findings are also evident in the cross-sectional morphology of the membranes. The membranes with embedded photocatalysts have a similar porous and finger-like structure that makes it possible to create a more porous structure, as previously discussed. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane possessed the highest porosity among other membranes, indicating that the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite can provide higher void formation during the phase inversion process compared to the pristine ZnO and MnO2. Membranes with higher porosity can perform better sorption of water and hydrophilicity, which can improve permeability. Additionally, the membranes' average pore radii were evaluated. Based on the results, it can be observed that the addition of photocatalysts into the membranes causes a slight increment in the average pore size from 40.32 nm for the neat PSf to 48.11, 45.78, and 42.76 nm for PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. This phenomenon can be correlated as the side effect of the gap formations due to the doping of photocatalysts. The formed gaps in the membrane's body are possible to increase the distribution of wider pores, which results in the larger average pore size of the modified membranes. Naturally, membranes with bigger pore sizes can generate lower selectivity. Nevertheless, the rise of the membrane's pore size is not too extreme; therefore, the negative impacts of pore size rising are not significant. It is also noteworthy that all membranes can be classified into ultrafiltration (UF) types since their average pore sizes still fall in the range of 10 to 100 nm.\",\n",
       "  \"Mechanical strength analysis is quite critical to show the robustness of the membrane when they are used in the actual filtration condition. The membranes' mechanical properties also have correlations with the durability and service life during application for wastewater treatment. The membranes' mechanical properties, including tensile strength and elongation at break were evaluated, as the results are depicted in Fig. 8(a). It is found that the tensile strengths of the membranes are 4.73, 4.31, 4.26, and 4.68 MPa, and the elongation at breaks values of 45.03, 42.30, 38.72, and 43.70 % for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Based on the results, it can be seen that the addition of photocatalysts relatively reduced the tensile strength and elongation at break of the membranes. This phenomenon is explainable that the photocatalyst sites in the polymer matrix create gaps between the polymer structure, which then weaken the polymer chains [60]. Corroboratively, based on the EDX and XRD results, they signify the presence of the crystallite sites in the modified membranes upon the photocatalyst addition. Due to the more gaps formed and the presence of crystallite sites, the polymer matrix structure becomes weaker, more brittle, and less elastic, which results in a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break. The modified membranes PSf/ZnO and PSf/MnO2 have a little bit lower mechanical strength compared to that of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. It is explainable by the SEM results that found some aggregation structure of the photocatalysts in the cross-sectional image of PSf/ZnO and PSf/MnO2 membranes. The aggregations create gaps between the polysulfone matrix and weaken the mechanical strength of the membrane, while in the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, the photocatalyst dispersion is much better. Hence, the mechanical properties of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane are better than the other two modified membranes. Furthermore, previous studies suggested not to add inorganic fillers with a concentration of >2 %-wt because it can reduce the membrane's mechanical strength and also possibly cause agglomerations [61]. Nonetheless, the decrease of mechanical properties in the modified membranes was not too bad. Since the applied pressure on filtration was set at 5 bar (~0.5 MPa), which is still far below the critical tensile strength of all membranes; thus, the membranes' mechanical strength is acceptable, and all membranes can still be applied for the filtration process.\",\n",
       "  \"Hydrophilicity is an essential characteristic of membrane-based technology for water and wastewater treatment applications. The hydrophilicity of the membranes explains the surface behavior of the water molecules. In this present work, the hydrophilicity of the membranes was examined using water contact angle measurement, as the results are depicted in Fig. 8(b). It is found that the water contact angles of the membranes were 81.55deg, 71.43deg, 73.21deg, and 65.59deg for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, respectively. It can be seen that with the photocatalysts' addition, the water contact angle was significantly reduced. The lower value of water contact angle means a more hydrophilic surface characteristic. Hydrophilic membrane surface can generate more permeate water and also can mitigate the fouling tendency, especially for highly polluted wastewater [62]. The neat PSf membrane possessed the lowest water contact angle, suggesting that the natural character of polysulfone is less hydrophilic; thus, it is not recommended to use the pristine PSf membrane without any modifications for wastewater treatment purposes. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane appeared as the most hydrophilic membrane, suggesting the lowest contact angle among other membranes. This can be due to the rich contained oxygenated groups such as Zn-O and Mn-O and the uniformly dispersed ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst sites on the surface of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, as revealed by FTIR, XRD, and EDX mapping results. The rich oxygenated groups and photocatalyst sites perform strong attraction van der Waals forces to the water molecules, thus, subsequently can enhance the membrane's permeability [62,63]. The better hydrophilicity of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane compared to PSf/ZnO and PSf/MnO2 is promoted by the higher surface energy. Fig. 8(c) shows the estimated surface energy of the fabricated membranes. The estimated surface energies were 6.73, 23.54, 19.60, and 44.17 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Surface energy shows the magnitude of attraction force of the surface towards water molecules [64]. Higher surface energy correlates with the hydrophilic surface; thus, the membrane with higher surface energy has better hydrophilicity (lower contact angle). In a similar shape, the water uptake ability improved on the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. It is found that the water uptake abilities were 39.77 %, 65.22 %, 61.75 %, and 70.43 % for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. The neat PSf possessed the lowest, whereas PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 showed the highest water uptake ability. Hydrophilicity and porosity play an equally dominant for the sorption ability. The PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 showed outstanding hydrophilicity and porosity; thus, the water molecules can rapidly fill the void space inside the membrane. This intense water sorption ability can also be helpful in enhancing the membrane's permeability.\",\n",
       "  'Initial checking of the effect of photocatalytic properties of the membranes on the membrane performance was carried out by determining pure water flux (PWF). The filtration experiments were performed by filtering DI water for 120 min and were carried out in the dark and under UV light irradiation conditions. Fig. 8(d) presents the results of PWF for all membranes. In the dark filtration condition, it can be observed that the PWF value is higher in the modified membranes with photocatalysts compared to the neat PSf. The measured average PWF values were 17.43, 26.35, 23.28, and 28.74 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Under UV light irradiation conditions, PWF values further increase only in the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. The measured PWFs under UV light irradiation was 17.58, 29.01, 25.21, 31.97 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 for respectively. These findings indicate that UV irradiation can improve the PWF in the membrane with embedded photocatalysts. The PWF improvement in membranes with embedded photocatalysts is caused by the increase of hydrophilicity during UV light irradiation. In the photocatalyst, the photo-induced holes can oxidize the superoxide radicals and create oxygen vacancies [65,66]. These oxygen vacancies tend to attract water molecules and generate adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups, thus enhancing the surface hydrophilicity [64,65]. The higher surface hydrophilicity led to providing a stronger attraction force to water molecules [64], which resulted in an improved PWF.',\n",
       "  \"Permeability profiles upon treating NRW using the fabricated membranes in the dark (conventional) and under UV light irradiation were thoroughly studied. The conventional filtration in the dark environment was conducted as the control variable, whereas the UV light irradiation was aimed to initiate the photocatalytic reaction on the membrane's surface. Fig. 9(a-d) compile the permeability profiles of neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, respectively, in the dark and under UV light irradiation conditions. It is found that the neat PSf membrane (MM-01) shows insignificant permeability profile differences between in the dark and under UV light conditions. It obviously signifies that pristine PSf polymer is not a photocatalytic material. Meanwhile, improvements in permeability are observed in the membrane with the embedded photocatalysts. The modified membranes with embedded photocatalysts show distinct improvements in permeability after being irradiated by UV light. The UV light irradiation seems to have significant effects on increasing the permeability of the modified membranes. In the membranes with a single photocatalyst, PSf/ZnO membrane (MM-02) exhibited better permeability than that of PSf/MnO2 (MM-03) in the dark and under UV light irradiation. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 exhibited the best and most stable permeability performance among other membranes. This membrane achieved a permeate flux of 23.54 L.m-2.h-1 in the dark condition, then improved to 27.31 L.m-2.h-1 when it was performed under UV light irradiation condition, as depicted in Fig. 9(d).\",\n",
       "  \"It is also found that the modified membranes with embedded photocatalysts not only performed better permeability in photo-filtration conditions but also enhanced the permeability in conventional dark filtration conditions compared to the neat PSf membrane. This occurrence can be caused by some reasons. First, the embedded photocatalysts increase the surface hydrophilicity of the membranes, thus, enhancing the surface attraction forces to the water molecule and then generating higher permeability. Second, the rougher membrane due to photocatalysts addition creates a larger filtration area and increases the contact between water and photocatalysts' sites. Third, the addition of photocatalysts generates higher porosity and water uptake ability; thus, the modified membranes can absorb more water, which results in higher permeate flux. Fourth, when the modified membranes are irradiated under UV light, the photocatalyst initiates a photocatalytic process, which subsequently generates radical molecules to degrade the attached pollutants on the membrane surface; thus, the filtration process is not disturbed by the deposited pollutants. The fifth reason is that the photo-generated holes during photocatalysis can produce the superoxide radicals and create the oxygen vacancies on the active sites [65,66], thus subsequently increasing the surface hydrophilicity and permeability. In conclusion, in the dark filtration condition, surface hydrophilicity, pore properties, sorption ability, and surface roughness control the permeability of the membranes, whereas, in the photo-filtration condition under UV light, the photocatalytic process dominates the control of the permeability of the membranes.\",\n",
       "  'The removal efficiency by membrane filtration was evaluated by measuring the pollutant concentrations at the initial and the end of the process. In this study, NRW was used as the feed water, and the removal efficiency was measured based on some pollutant parameters, including TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N contents. The pollutant removal performance of the neat PSf and modified membranes are shown in Fig. 10. It can be observed that the membranes with different embedded photocatalysts show different removal abilities. The modified membranes with photocatalysts exhibit higher removal efficiency either in the dark or under UV light conditions compared to that of the neat PSf membrane. Furthermore, UV light irradiation improves the removal efficiencies of the modified membranes. In the dark condition, the neat PSf membrane removes 22.31 %, 18.75 %, 28.73 %, and 20.51 % of TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively. When the UV irradiation was performed in the neat PSf membrane, no noticeable improvements were captured. In contrast, the modified membranes with photocatalysts showed distinct enhancement when they were irradiated by UV light during the filtration experiment. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane presents the best pollutant removal among the other membranes under UV light irradiation and in dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 10(d). In the conventional filtration condition, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exhibits 59.31 %, 53.43 %, 60.18 %, and 58.44 % of TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N removals, respectively, whereas, under UV light irradiation the removal efficiencies increase to 73.26 %, 68.33 %, 78.92 %, and 75.69 % for TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N removals, respectively.',\n",
       "  'After being performed under UV light irradiation, the improved pollutant removals occurred for some reasons. First, the photocatalytic degradation process can be helpful in improving pollutant removal. The photo-generated radicals, either superoxide (0O2-) or hydroxyl (0OH) in the active sites (embedded photocatalysts), can react with the pollutant molecules by redox reaction and degrade them into small molecules [53]. Second, the defect-free surface and uniformly distributed photocatalyst on the membrane surface are also valuable for performing better pollutant removal. Third, the highly hydrophilic sites on the modified membrane surface also improved the pollutant rejection by performing repulsion forces against the pollutant (organic matter), which usually presents in different polarities [66]. Since the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite shows a prominent semiconductor property by attributing bandgap energy of 2.65 eV, uniformly distributed photocatalysts particles on the membrane surface, and the highly hydrophilic surface, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane appears as the best membrane in pollutant removal compared to other membranes.',\n",
       "  'Effects of adsorption and photocatalysis on photodegradation performance of the neat PSf and modified membranes were evaluated. This evaluation was done by measuring the pollutant removal, including phenol, COD, and NH3-N, under UV light conditions. The changing of concentration profiles (Ct/Co) for the tested membranes are shown in Fig. 11. It is found that prior to the UV light being turned on, there are small removals that occurred on all three pollutant parameters on the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. The removal before UV light irradiation can correspond to the occurrence of surface adsorption. This finding shows that the active sites of the photocatalysts can also perform pollutant adsorption besides photocatalysis. The rich oxygenated sites on the membrane surface also generate strong van der Waals attraction forces to the charged pollutant molecules, thus, resulting in adsorption performance [64,67]. Interestingly, the membrane embedded by ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 shows a slightly higher adsorption effect compared to other photocatalysts. This result is in agreement with the BET-BJH analysis, which reflects the more comprehensive sorption range and specific surface area that boosted the adsorption performance of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Moreover, after the UV lamp was turned on, the pollutant degradations significantly improved, specifically in the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. In this state, photocatalysis plays the dominant role in pollutant removals. It is observed that the PSf membrane shows insignificant removal ability during the process, which signifies that the PSf membrane has no photocatalytic characteristics whatsoever. The modified membranes present the improved pollutant removal performance under UV light exposure and strengthen the finding that photocatalysis is far too dominant in the photodegradation of pollutants compared to the adsorption process.',\n",
       "  \"The characteristics of photodegradation of pollutants were evaluated further using two kinetics models, including the zero order and pseudo-first order models. These evaluations were done by determining the pollutants degradation rates of the fabricated membranes. Initially, the membrane sheet was mounted onto the glass holder and immersed in the NRW sample. This experiment was performed in a dark and closed chamber utilized with a UV lamp (see Fig. 1(b)). Before the UV lamp was turned on, the membrane was left in the NRW sample for 60 min in order to achieve the adsorption equilibrium state for ensuring that only the photocatalysis was performed for the pollutant removal. Fig. 12 (a-f) show the fitting plots of degradation kinetic on phenol, COD, and NH3-N removals, respectively, using zero-order and pseudo-first order kinetics, whereas the fitting parameters are listed in Table 6. Based on the results, it is observed that the neat PSf membrane (MM-01) did not show any removal performance under this photocatalytic experiment. The photocatalytic degradations of pollutants remarkably improved in the modified membranes with the embedded photocatalysts (MM-02 - MM-04). In addition, the pollutants' degradation rates of the membranes using both models follow this order: MM-04 > MM-02 > MM-03  MM-01. A higher rate constant represents faster photocatalytic degradation can be obtained. This indicates that the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 has the strongest photocatalytic power compared to other membranes. From the average coefficient of determinations (R2avg), it is found that the pseudo-first order kinetic model is a better fit than the zero order. R2avg values of pseudo-first order are 0.9489, 0.9394, and 0.9668 for phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively, whereas for the zero-order are 0.9401, 0.9338, and 0.9646 for phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively.\",\n",
       "  \"In common heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation, reactive species including holes, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals are the main substances to degrade the pollutants. In this study, trapping tests were performed to investigate further the relevance, existence, and relative activity of the reactive species on pollutant degradations. Oxalic acid, benzoquinone, and methanol were used as the scavengers for holes, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively [45]. Fig. 13(a-c) depict the effect of scavengers on phenol, COD, and NH3-N degradations using PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, respectively. It can be observed that the scavengers reduce the photodegradation efficiency on all membranes. This means that the scavengers disrupt the active species to react with pollutants. The relative order of active species' effects on photocatalytic degradation can be ordered as h+ > 0O2- > 0OH. It is also found that all active species play essential roles in pollutant degradation; eliminating one of them resulted in the reduction of degradation efficiency.\",\n",
       "  'Fig. 14 illustrates the proposed mechanisms of the photocatalytic process using the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. ZnO-MnO2 plays a vital role in the photocatalysis reaction, while SiO2 provides the adsorption of pollutant molecules to be closer to the photocatalyst, resulting in easier and faster degradation of pollutants [53]. In specific, when the composite is irradiated with photon energy from UV light, the electrons (e-) are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). In the CB, the photo-induced electrons transferred from the higher potential of ZnO to the lower potential of MnO2, while in the VB, the empty sites filled with the photo-induced holes (h+) that transferred from VB of ZnO to VB of MnO2[68]. In Fig. 14(a), it is observed that the CB of MnO2 is more positive than the energy level for superoxide radical (0O2-) generations; hence, the reduction reaction to generate 0O2- has less possibility of taking place on the CB of MnO2. Due to the excellent electron conductivity of MnO2, some electrons reacted with Mn4+ ions to form Mn3+[69]. Then, the Mn3+ ion can react with O2 to form Mn4+ and 0O2-. The VBs of ZnO and MnO2 appear more positive than the potential energy to generate hydroxyl radicals (0OH); therefore, the oxidation reaction can take place, as reflected in Fig. 14(a). In the VB of MnO2, the photo-induced holes reacted with water (H2O) or hydroxyl (OH-) molecules through an oxidation reaction to produce the hydroxyl radicals (0OH). As both generated radicals have strong reactivity, 0O2- and 0OH radicals reacted with pollutants to degrade them and resulting in CO2, H2O, and mineral acids as the products [28]. An illustration of mechanisms of pollutant degradation by the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite by heterojunction pathway under UV light irradiation can be seen in Fig. 14(b). The detailed mechanisms of the photocatalytic process of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 are as follows:',\n",

       "  \"To assess the stability of the flux and pollutant rejection performance, the membranes were used to treat the NRW sample for 15 h, and the flux and pollutant rejection were calculated during this assessment, as the results are shown in Fig. 15(a). Based on Fig. 15(a), it is found that in the dark condition, the pristine PSf membrane (MM-01) experienced an extreme flux reduction during the period from 16.67 L.m-2.h-1 at the beginning of the process and leaving a pseudo-static permeability of 2.02 L.m-2.h-1 after going through 15 h of filtration. Meanwhile, in the same dark condition of filtration, PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane (MM-04) exhibited a significant improvement in the permeability compared to the neat PSf membrane. This membrane experienced a starting flux of 23.50 L.m-2.h-1 and maintained a pseudo-static flux of about 6.89 L.m-2.h-1 afterward. It is explainable by the increase of the membrane's hydrophilicity after being embedded by the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 nanoparticles, which play a key role in boosting the permeability of the membrane, especially in the dark (conventional) filtration condition. However, the membrane still struggled to maintain high and stable permeability, which signifies the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane in the dark condition has a limited capability to tackle fouling formation. Further permeability improvement was observed by irradiating the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane under UV light during the filtration process to carry out the photocatalytic activity of the membrane. It is found that the magnitude of the flux of this membrane is the highest compared to MM-01 (dark) and MM-04 (dark). Under UV light exposure, the membrane achieved an initial flux of 27.12 L.m-2.h-1 and can perfectly maintain a pseudo-static flux of 18.02 L.m-2.h-1 until the end of the filtration period. The UV irradiation on the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane also exhibited an outstanding pollutant removal ability. It is found that the pollutants removal of MM-04 (UV) was 74.31 %, 70.25 %, 80.93 %, and 76.55 % for removals of TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively. This finding suggests that UV irradiation triggered a photocatalysis reaction on the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite on the surface of the membrane, which destroyed the concentrated contaminants, thus, making it easier for water molecules to move through the membrane as well as contributing to improving the pollutant removal performance [70,71].\",\n",
       "  'The reusability test using three consecutive cycles of filtration was performed under UV light irradiation, and the results are presented in Fig. 15(b). At the starting point of the test, the measured permeabilities were 16.67, 23.55, 21.10, and 27.11 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf (MM-01), PSf/ZnO (MM-02), PSf/MnO2 (MM-03), and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 (MM-04), respectively. Based on the results, the neat PSf membrane experienced the lowest permeability and lack of flux recovery in the next cycles, which suggests that the neat PSf membrane is susceptible to fouling. Other membranes with embedded nanoparticles show improvements in the magnitude of permeability and flux recovery ability. After two cycles, the measured permeabilities at the beginning of the third cycle were 9.97, 18.55, 17.82, and 25.33 L.m-2.h-1, whereas, at the end of the cycle test, it was found that the membrane permeabilities were 1.55, 9.45, 7.32, and 17.03 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Hence, it is noteworthy that the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 appears as the best membrane in flux magnitude, stability, retrievability, and reusability compared to other membranes. Fig. 15(c-e) present the results of photocatalytic degradation abilities of the membranes upon three process cycles. It is found that different membranes exhibited different profiles of pollutant degradations. It can be observed that PSf/MnO2 shows the weakest photodegradation ability compared to PSf/ZnO and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2. It can be correlated to the weak absorption capacity of UV light energy by the membrane composite as revealed by UV-vis DRS results, thus, making it struggles to perform the photocatalytic process. On the other hand, PSf/ZnO and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes demonstrated the stronger photodegradation ability and retrievability under UV light irradiation. This is strongly correlated due to a strong UV light energy absorption capacity by these membranes [57]. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 experienced the best pollutant degradation efficiency and showed nice degradation stability in three cycles of the process. Therefore, these results indicate that the fabricated photocatalytic composite membranes, particularly the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, it has an excellent and long-lasting photocatalytic ability, which is desirable for NRW treatment.',\n",
       "  'The antifouling properties of the fabricated membranes were evaluated through several parameters, including flux profile under certain conditions, resistance during filtration measurement, flux recovery ratio, and the ratio between reversible and irreversible fouling, as the results are compiled in Fig. 16. Fig. 16(a) represents the results of flux profiles under different conditions of filtration. Ji shows the initial pure water flux, Ja represents the pure water flux after the membrane was immersed in the NRW sample to cause static fouling, Jf represents the pure water flux after the membrane was used for NRW filtration, and Jv is the flux of actual NRW filtration [46]. According to the results, it can be seen that the modified membranes with photocatalysts show higher flux values compared to the neat PSf both in the dark and under UV light exposure, indicating the enhanced antifouling performance of the modified membranes. The maximum flux performance was achieved for the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exposed to UV light irradiation, which can be due to the occurrence of photocatalytic reaction in the nanoparticle composite. This mechanism creates a maximum capability to degrade the attached foulants, resulting in a reduction of membrane resistance, thus creating higher permeability of the membrane.',\n",
       "  'The partial elements of membrane resistance, including intrinsic (Rm), adsorptive (Ra), deposition (Rd), and concentration polarization (Rcp) resistances in the dark and under UV light conditions of filtration were assessed, and the results are depicted in Fig. 16(b). The neat PSf and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 demonstrated the maximum and minimum membrane resistance in all conditions, respectively. In membrane filtration, lower resistance is more desirable in order to generate a higher permeate flux rate. When PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane was exposed to UV light irradiation, the resistance was reduced by about 52.43 % compared to the same membrane in the dark filtration condition. Moreover, the resistance reduction occurred in all constituting elements of resistance, suggesting that the photocatalytic properties of the membrane play an important role in preventing the formation of fouling on the membrane.',\n",
       "  \"Fig. 16(c) depicts the total fouling ratio (RT), reversible fouling ratio (RR), irreversible fouling ratio (RIr), and permeate flux recovery ratio (FRR) of the membranes in the dark and under UV light exposure. The modified membranes exhibited lower fouling ratios compared to the corresponding value of the neat PSf membrane. Furthermore, the FRR of all modified membranes irradiated with UV light was higher than that of the neat PSf membrane, suggesting the improved antifouling activities of the modified membranes due to the photocatalytic process by degrading concentrated pollutants on the membrane's surface to prevent the fouling formation. However, no significant improvement regarding the antifouling properties of the neat PSf membrane (MM-01) was observed when it was irradiated with UV light. It is due to the fact that the neat PSf is not classified as a photocatalytic material. The values of RR and RIr of the modified membranes were lower than that of neat PSf. As an example, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 (MM-04) has the RT value of 34.27 % in the dark condition, which consists of 44.15 % of RR and 55.85 % of RIr. Once it was irradiated with UV light, the total fouling ratio reduced to 21.26 % which 73.52 % is relevant to RR and 26.48 % is relevant to RIr. The declined RT value indicates that the modified membrane is more capable of preventing fouling occurrence [72]. Moreover, the reduction of irreversible fouling proportion when the membrane was exposed to UV light suggests that the pore blocking in the membrane by the pollutant molecules can be reduced due to the photocatalytic degradation effect of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite on the membrane's surface. In comparison with irreversible fouling, the reversible fouling on the membrane is repairable and easier to treat by a simple method such as conventional rinsing [42]. Therefore, performing the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane under UV light irradiation significantly improved the antifouling properties to prevent fouling formation and prolong the usability of the membrane.\",\n",
       "  'The basic properties and key findings of the prepared PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 irradiated under UV light that tested in the photocatalytic membrane filtration system are compared with other similar studies in the literature as summarized in Table 7. As comprised in Table 7, relative to other photocatalytic composite membranes, PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane shows comparable improvements in permeability, pollutant removal, flux stability, photocatalytic ability, and antifouling properties. Synergetic outstanding surface characteristics such as roughness, wettability, and porosity with photocatalytic activity from of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite resulted in those significant improvements. The utilization of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite in PSf for treating the highly polluted NRW was not the case in other reported studies in the literature. In conclusion, this present study can provide new insight into treating the contaminated water using integrated filtration and photocatalysis in a single membrane composite.',\n",
       "  \"This present study investigates the effects of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst addition in the polysulfone (PSf) membrane that performed a combined membrane filtration and photocatalytic process under UV light irradiation for natural rubber-laden wastewater (NRW) treatment. The photocatalyst composites were synthesized using the sol-gel method, and the membranes were prepared using the phase inversion technique. SEM and EDX mapping results show that the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exhibited a smooth surface with a well-constructed finger-like structure and a pretty uniform dispersion of photocatalysts elementals on its surface. AFM results support the finding that the addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst resulted in a rougher surface image that increased the contact area, thus, boosting the membrane's permeability. Several new polar functional groups such as Zn-O, Mn-O, and Si-O-Si were confirmed in the FTIR spectrum of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. DRS results showed that the MnO2 doping in ZnO successfully improved the photo-sensitivity and photocatalytic activity of the composite, suggesting the reduction of the bandgap energy from 3.10 eV to 2.65 eV, which promoted the photocatalytic improvement. The addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst also improved the membrane porosity, hydrophilicity, water uptake ability, and mechanical strength. Furthermore, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane also exhibited enhanced performance on permeate flux, pollutant rejection, and photo-degradation ability. Reactive species (h+, 0O2-, 0OH) contributed as the photo-degradation agents. The photocatalytic kinetic evaluation suggested that the pollutant degradation behavior showed a better fit using the pseudo-first order kinetic model rather than the zero-order model, with the highest photocatalytic degradation rate achieved by PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Performing the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane under UV light irradiation significantly improved the flux stability, membrane recyclability, and antifouling properties to prevent the fouling formation and prolong the usability of the membrane. In conclusion, according to all characteristics and performance, PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane is found to be the most promising UV light-driven photocatalytic membrane for effective NRW treatment.\",\n",

       "  \"Nowadays, considering vast industrial progression and thus quick increment of industrial wastewater, purification techniques are among the most momentous concerns of environmental issues. Due to the low applied pressure and appropriate flux, nanofiltration (NF) membranes have attracted considerable attention in various industries, including textile, pharmaceutical, water purification, biotechnology, and food [1-4]. These types of membranes have a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) in the range of 200 to 1000 Da. It is noteworthy that not only does the filtration performance of NF membranes depend on the steric exclusion (sieving effects) but also on the charge repulsion (Donnan effects) [5-7]. Non-biodegradability and high toxicity of dyes and the presence of these compounds in the industrial effluents can cause a variety of inevitable environmental problems. Therefore, dye recycling and re-entry into the manufacturing cycle prevents environmental damage and reduces factories' annual costs [8-11]. It highlights the essence of investigations on the development of NF membranes toward cost-effective and high-efficiency products.\",\n",
       "  'Scientists have studied several different materials to produce membranes, each with its own unique results. One of the most widespread polymers utilized in the fabrication of industrial membranes is polyethersulfone (PES). The mentioned polymer exhibits various desirable properties, such as superior chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability, as well as pH resistance. On the other hand, hydrophobicity can be considered as the principal drawback of PES, which eventually causes high fouling tendency [12-15]. Various studies have been carried out to modify and hydrophilize membranes. The most prevalent methods to modify membrane hydrophilicity are (I) surface modification through X-ray and gamma-ray exposure [16,17] or applying a surface layer of the secondary polymer [18-21], (II) bulk modification by embedding organic or inorganic nanoparticles to fabricate mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) [22-24], and (III) fabrication of a polymer blend using a polymer with higher hydrophilicity than the neat polymer [25,26].',\n",
       "  'Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is a semi-crystalline block copolymer, comprised of two distinct segments with different properties. The first segment, called hard segment, is produced by urethane linkages, and causes the crystalline nature of the copolymer. The second, soft segment, generally contains ether or ester linkages that lead to the amorphous nature of the respective copolymer [25,27]. TPU is able to obtain numerous outstanding properties, including superior tensile and abrasion resistance, superb tear and oil resistance, and good flexibility [27,28]. Hence, according to the significant merits mentioned above and suitable TPU hydrophilicity, it can be marked as an appealing candidate to fabricate polymer blends. For instance, Panda et al. [26] have reported the results of fabricating polyacrylonitrile/polyurethane blend membrane. The mentioned study demonstrated the effect of polyurethane enhancement on membrane performance and concluded that increasing the hydrophilicity can successfully amend flux and antifouling ability. In another study, published by Adams et al. [29], they succeeded in removing Pb2+ from water, up to 70 percentage, through a blend of polysulfone and b-Cyclodextrin polyurethane (b-CDPU). The evidence indicated that the more b-CDPU content, the more hydrophilicity, and the more water permeability. A study presented by Mansour et al. [30] revealed the impact of adding sulfonated polyurethane to polyethersulfone on membrane performance in blood purification. The importance of this study was that it provided anticoagulant improvement by sulfonated polyurethane enhancement.',\n",
       "  \"As previously mentioned, numerous studies have been documented on the impact of diverse nanoparticles on improving membrane performance. Graphene oxide (GO) and its derivatives are among the most popular nanoparticles in the scientific community. Graphite, with a multi-layer and three-dimensional aromatic structure, was converted to GO using hummer's technique [31]. Graphite went through exfoliation and oxidation and then changed to a single-layer and two-dimensional material, called GO. It is worth pointing out that the presence of various hydrophilic functional groups, such as epoxide, hydroxyl, and carboxyl in GO causes negative surface charges. Besides the negative charges, mechanical stability, extreme electron transport, and high surface area are the most significant properties of GO [32-37]. All these attributes motivated scientists to utilize GO and its derivatives for MMMs fabrication. Achieving a convincing scale of intermolecular forces between GO and matrix is one of the most significant challenges. Applying adequate intermolecular forces would result in leaching hindrance and GO maintenance into the polymer bulk. Several intermolecular forces can induce the required forces. The p-p interactions, as an intermolecular force, require a matching geometry between GO and matrix, as well as p-bonds. Similarly, hydrogen bonds, as Van Der Waals forces, can impact on GO-Matrix adhesion [38]. Hence, the functionalization of GO, with a compound having suitable functional groups, can reinforce the interfacial interaction between polymer matrix and functionalized GO [39].\",\n",
       "  'For controlling membrane morphology and gaining the desired performance, researchers can employ various phase inversion techniques. The main issue in the phase inversion process, which characterizes membrane morphology, is the rate of phase inversion. The phase inversion rate has a direct effect on membrane pore size. In the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique, various factors affect phase inversion rate. There are several manners to generate the membranes with arbitrary performance using the NIPS technique. Type of solvent and non-solvent, percentage of polymer in the dope solution, and coagulation bath temperature can be counted as main factors affecting membrane morphology, obtained by NIPS technique [40]. On the other side, vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) method, as a phase inversion technique, has been expanded as a valuable technique to generate membranes. This technique provides a profound difference in the performance and morphology of the membranes in comparison to the membranes produced by the NIPS technique. Due to the delay in the phase inversion process during the VIPS technique, the membrane finger-like area is reduced, and the sponge-like area is increased compared to the membranes produced by NIPS procedure. Relative humidity, temperature of the climatic box, and exposure time can impact the membrane morphology in the VIPS technique. Prolonging the exposure time can also tend to create pin-hole structures in the membrane top surfaces [41]. To solve the problem, simultaneous usage of the two mentioned techniques, as VIPS-NIPS technique, is considered as a practical solution [42,43]. Applying this technique reduces exposure time and thus prevents the formation of pin-hole structures.',\n",

The difference between NIPS and VIPS-NIPS techniques led us to compare these two techniques and examine the performance of the resulting membranes with the mentioned techniques separately. Moreover, the outstanding mechanical properties of TPU and amine-functionalized GO prompted us to investigate the effect of these two materials on the mechanical properties of the prepared membranes.

The residual solid frequently washed through deionized (DI) water up to the supernatant pH became neutral. Eventually, the resulting substance dried by vacuum oven at 65 degC for 24 h.\",\n",
       "  'To synthesize GO-APTS, 1 g of GO provided by the reaction mentioned above was added to 240 mL of toluene. The obtained mixture was placed in an ultrasonication bath for 3 h to produce a homogenous dispersion. APTS (28.4 g) has been added to the previous mixture and then two reflux steps were conducted under N2 atmosphere. The first and second steps were applied at room temperature for 5 h and at 100 degC for the next 5 h, respectively. The final mixture was rinsed by toluene to eliminate the remaining APTS and then filtered by simple decanter and the resulting GO-APTS dried and gathered at 65 degC for an overnight [45]. All the nanoparticle synthesis procedure was summarized in Scheme 1.',\n",
       "  'The membranes were generated through a special kind of phase separation method called VIPS-NIPS technique. Due to the differences between the phase separation rate of VIPS-NIPS and NIPS techniques, comparing the performance of the M2 membrane prepared by the VIPS-NIPS, with M5 membrane, prepared by the NIPS method, can exemplify fascinating results. The presence of volatile co-solvents in the VIPS-NIPS process has tremendous contribution to create an integrated membrane [42]. In the VIPS-NIPS technique, according to Table 1, PES and TPU were initially added to a mixture of DMF and 1,4-dioxane, used as solvent and co-solvent, respectively, and then, continuously stirred for 24 h at a temperature of 80 degC. After obtaining a homogeneous solution, a desiccator was utilized for 90 min to remove air bubbles from the casting solution. By employing a casting knife device (Doctor Blade) with a thickness of 200 mm, the respective solution was cast on a glass plate in a climatic box with a temperature of 40 degC and 60 +- 5% relative humidity. With the exposure time expiration, the casted film was immersed in a water coagulation bath at room temperature. The NIPS technique has some distinctions with VIPS-NIPS. There is no requirement for climatic box in this method. Eventually, the optimized membrane was selected to fabricate the mixed matrix membrane, and precise amounts of GO-APTS nanoparticles were embedded in it. Since the optimized membrane is prepared by the VIPS-NIPS method, it is necessary to mention that the fabrication procedure of mixed matrix membranes is approximately similar to the above-mentioned procedure. The only difference that can be pointed is that before adding the polymers to the solvents, the mixture of nanoparticles and solvents was sonicated for 60 min to have a homogeneous dispersion. The prepared membranes were all submerged in deionized water for two days to entirely remove the remaining solvents. Scheme 2 illustrated the fabrication process of mixed matrix blend membrane.',\n",
       "  'Several analyses techniques were conducted to study the chemical and physical properties of the fabricated membranes. Surface hydrophilicity measurements of the prepared membranes were done utilizing a static water contact angle test (Dataphysics, OCA 15 plus). The presented values are the average of three measurements resulting from three different zones on each membrane. atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (NT-MDT) has been employed via performing in a semi-contact mode to evaluate the roughness of the membrane surfaces. As an X-ray Diffraction (XRD) apparatus, Philips PW1730 device with the monochromatic source of Cu-Ka radiation was utilized to specify X-ray diffraction patterns of the membranes. The membranes have been investigated in 2th range with an angle beginning from 10deg to 70deg Surface and cross-section morphology of the prepared membranes, have been conducted through utilizing Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), TESCAN, MIRA III, Czech Republic. Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of membranes have been yielded using a device with Avatar-370, Thermo specifications from the USA, to investigate membrane functional groups. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been performed to evaluate the chemical composition of the optimized membranes (Thermo Scientific, K-Alpha+, USA). All the obtained mechanical quantities of the membranes were measured by Instron 5542 tensiometer (Instron, USA). Mechanical analyses were done at ambient temperature and 5 mm/min strain rate. The resulting data are the average of at least five samples. Membrane surface charge was calculated by operating the zeta potential measurement test (SZ-100, Horiba).',\n",

(I) Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) was utilized to characterize the created functional groups during the GO-APTS synthesis. (II) The changes in the XRD spectra are another experiment that has been analyzed. (III) As a reliable technique, XPS was accomplished to figure out the electronic states of atoms and the chemical composition of GO-APTS. Comparing obtained spectra of graphite, GO, and GO-APTS separately confirms GO-APTS synthesis. It is worth emphasizing that the device specifications of the three mentioned techniques have been noted in the previous section.',\n",
       "  'Two of the most critical factors affecting membrane performance are total membrane porosity (e) and mean pore radius (rm). The gravimetric procedure was considered as a practical technique to ascertain total membrane porosity [46]. As shown in Eq. (1), to calculate the total porosity, weight of the dry (o2) and wet (o1) membranes are required. A corresponds to membrane effective surface area (m2), l is ascribed to the thickness of the membrane (m), and dw denotes the water density (kg.m- 3). Guerout-Elford-Ferry equation [47] has been utilized to calculate mean pore radius (Eq. (2)). It is necessary to mention that e is related to water viscosity (Pa.s), Q is attributed to the volume of the permeated pure water per unit time (m3.s- 1), and DP corresponds to applied pressure (Pa). The result of these two parameters have been represented in Table 1.(1)e=o1-o2Axlxdw(2)rm=8(2.9-1.75e)elQAxexDP',\n",
       "  'The fabricated membranes performance at ambient temperature has been designated by pure water flux (PWF) determinations utilizing distilled water and also dye and salt rejection evaluation. The named items were calculated by applying self-made dead-end filtration equipment. Four different aqueous dye solutions (30 ppm) including MB, CV, MG, and DY-29 as well as three salt solutions (200 ppm) including MgCl2, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 have been individually employed to measure the rejection ability of the membranes and for this purpose, before and after filtration, the concentration of dye and salt solutions has been measured through a UV-VIS spectrophotometer and conductivity meter device, respectively. It is important to note that dye and salt removal and PWF evaluation have been achieved with 12.4 cm2 effective surface area and 7 bar applied pressure. Ultimately, the measured data have been evaluated through the Eq. (3) and Eq. (4). As shown in the following equations, some quantities demand to be defined. Eq. (3) was applied to calculate the membrane PWF, in which Jw,1 is related to the flux of distilled water (L/m2.h), and V, A, and t are denominated to the volume of the permeate distilled water (L), the effective membrane area (m2), and the interlude of the operation time (h), respectively. Eq. (4) has been accepted for dye and salt rejection calculation. The percentage of removal is shown as R(%).

Following the pure water flux measurement, BSA with the concentration of 1000 ppm, as a convincing fouling agent, has been instantly substituted into the stirred cell. BSA solution flux was figured out and assigned to Jp (L/m2.h). After the above measurement, the obtained membranes were rinsed through distilled water for 20 min to remove the residual BSA. Finally, the pure water flux of the washed membranes was re-evaluated. The secondary pure water flux was labeled as Jw,2 (L/m2.h). All steps of the fouling test were calculated under 7 bar pressure for 30 min.',\n",

According to this equation, it is absolutely obvious that the higher FRR displays a better membrane antifouling property. Eqs. (6)-8 indicate reversible fouling ratio (Rr), irreversible fouling ratio (Rir), and total fouling ratio (Rt), respectively. It is worth noting that Rr demonstrates the fouling originated from concentration polarization. Protein's adsorption-deposition process yields a special kind of membrane fouling called Rir. It is evident that to represent total fouling amount (Rt), both of the aforementioned fouling parameters should be considered simultaneously.(5)FRR(%)=(Jw,2Jw,1)x100(6)Rr(%)=(Jw,2-JpJw,1)x100(7)Rir(%)=(Jw,1-Jw,2Jw,1)x100(8)Rt(%)=Rr+Rir=(1-JpJw,1)x100\",\n",
       "  \"Three characterization tests, including XRD, FTIR, and XPS, have been studied to examine the GO-APTS synthesis. Considering the synthesis process of GO-APTS, which initiates with the graphite oxidation and terminates with the graphene oxide functionalization, analysis investigation of neat graphite, graphene oxide, and GO-APTS provides a valid situation to confirm successful GO-APTS synthesis. It is discernible in Fig. 1 that the neat graphite XRD pattern demonstrates two of Bragg's diffraction peaks. The first is an intense peak at 2th = 26.45@, and the second is a weak peak at 2th = 54.60@. It is important to emphasize that the above-mentioned peaks correspond to (002) and (004) crystal planes, respectively. GO and GO-APTS diffraction patterns can be seen in the respective Figure's second and third XRD patterns. GO has two distinct peaks which one of them is about 2th = 11.14@ that originating from the smooth, stack, and crystalline nature of the GO, and the other peak that emerged at 2th = 42.81@ is related to the residual graphitic area and it is because of the incomplete exfoliation during GO synthesis [49]. The crystal planes of GO peaks are (001) and (100), respectively [50,51]. The main sharp GO peak entirely vanished after APTS functionalization. Indeed, functionalization of GO via APTS results in GO sheets separation from each other and forms an irregular structure. Finally, because of the disappearance of GO regularity, the peak of GO at 2th = 11.14@ has been vanished in the GO-APTS XRD pattern [52]. The XRD results obtained from GO-APTS exhibit a broad intense peak at 2th = 22.84@ and a weak peak at 2th = 43.1@ [53].\",\n",
       "  \"The FTIR analyses is operated in order to investigate prosperous GO functionalization. Fig. 2 represent GO and GO-APTS FTIR spectra. As illustrated in the GO spectrum, the epoxide group (CO-C) has two characteristic absorption bands at 1041 cm-1 and 1206 cm-1. Moreover, the C = C peak has emerged at 1612 cm-1, which is ascribed to skeletal vibration. The OH stretching peak has appeared at 3330 cm-1, which is consistently attending in an extensive absorption peak mode. The carboxyl group's carbonyl (C = O) demonstrates a strong absorption peak at 1718 cm-1, corresponding to stretching vibration [50,54]. In another parts of Fig. 2, it can be seen that the new functional groups have emerged in GO-APTS spectrum. There are two new absorption peaks at 1024 cm-1 and 1072 cm-1, which are attributed to (Si-O-C) and (Si-O-Si), respectively. Asymmetric and symmetric vibration peaks at 2857 cm-1 and 2921 cm-1 are ascribed to (CH). The existence of CN stretching (1205 cm-1) and NH stretching (3309 cm-1) verifies the presence of amine groups in the synthesized compound. On the other side, by comparing the GO and GO-APTS's carbonyl peaks, it can be discerned that the reaction between the GO's carboxyl group and APTS has led to the formation of the amide and silyl ester functional groups [53]. Therefore, the GO's carbonyl absorption peak has been shifted from 1718 cm-1 to 1668 cm-1 after APTS functionalization. Epoxide peak disappearance in GO-APTS is another confirmation of the reaction of GO and APTS [54-56].\",\n",
       "  'The XPS test has also been accomplished to confirm the successful GO and GO-APTS synthesis. It is evident in Fig. 3 that the peak corresponding to O (1 s) in the GO survey spectrum verifies the successful oxidation of graphite and it proves the prosperous GO synthesis. In the other survey XPS spectrum, related to GO-APTS, the emergence of peak attributed to N (1 s) along with the appearance of peaks ascribed to Si (2p) and Si (2 s) are robust confirmation of the GO functionalization [57]. Moreover, deconvolution spectra of the XPS analyses were demonstrated in Fig. 4. By drawing a comparison between Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b, it can be discerned that after GO functionalization, some new bonds (CN, CO-Si, and CO-C) have appeared at C (1 s) peak [39,57].',\n",
       "  'ATR-FTIR spectroscopy has been conducted to prove successful PES/TPU blending and GO-APTS embedding. Fig. 5 demonstrates all the prepared membranes FTIR spectra. There are some peaks corresponding to the M0 membrane that are also observed in other membranes spectra. It is clearly evident in the spectra that both the 1145 cm-1 (symmetric stretching) and 1294 cm-1 (asymmetric stretching) strong absorption peaks are related to the sulfone (O = S = O) functional group. The peak appeared at 1232 cm-1, also corresponds to CO stretching vibration. In addition, the peaks signified at 1483 cm-1 and 1573 cm-1 are also ascribed to the aromatic ring stretch [58]. By making a comparison between pristine PES membrane spectrum (M0) and those of the TPU-including membranes (M1-M4), it is entirely specified that two new absorption peaks emerged at 1722 cm-1 (C = O) and 1527 cm-1 (CN), which are the most significant differences between them [59]. As identified in the nanoparticle-containing membranes (M6-M8), the absorption peak appearance at 1668 cm-1 verifies the presence of the carbonyl group of amide and silyl ester existing in GO-APTS.',\n",
       "  'X-ray diffraction analysis was done to investigate the crystalline nature of TPU blended and GO-APTS embedded to PES membranes. It is apparent in Fig. 6 that pristine PES has a wide XRD peak at 2th = 17.58@ that corresponds to its amorphous peak of PES. In other XRD patterns (M1-M4), it can be seen that two sharp peak have revealed at 2th = 21.79@ and 2th = 23.19@, corresponding to TPU, demonstrating its crystalline nature [59]. XRD patterns of GO-APTS-containing membranes (M6-M8) have no visible changes in MMMs because of overlapping the main GO-APTS peak.',\n",

The M2 spectrum demonstrates the presence of N elements which verify the addition of TPU to PES [60]. On the other hand, the resulting spectrum of the M7 membrane not only exhibits an increase in N (1 s) peak intensity, but also indicates the appearance of Si (2p) and Si (2 s) peaks. All the obtained data display the successful TPU blending and GO-APTS embedding. Moreover, elemental composotion of the membrane surfaces obtained by XPS has been presented in Table 2.',\n",
       "  'The water contact angle (WCA) test can count as a practical technique to investigate the effect of TPU and GO-APTS on the enhancement of surface hydrophilic nature of the membranes. Increasing membrane hydrophilicity has two significant benefits. (I) It can improve the membrane antifouling property and (II) increase membrane permeability. As illustrated in Fig. 8, WCA of pristine PES is 72.9@, and by increasing the TPU percentage, WCA decreases to 53.4@ in the M4 membrane. Comparing nanoparticle-containing membranes with M2 membrane makes it easy to see that adding nanoparticles reduces WCA. The resulting data demonstrate that GO-APTS enhancement, up to 0.3% wt, diminishes WCA of the respective membranes. On the other hand, it can be seen that due to the nanoparticle agglomeration and decline of the functional groups on the surface of the membrane, including 0.5% wt GO-APTS, WCA has slightly increased [61].',\n",

It is completely clear that charge repulsion (Donnan effects) is one of the mechanisms affecting membrane ability to remove charged particles. It can be discerned from related Figure that both the TPU and GO-APTS led the membranes to more negative zeta potential values. By drawing a comparison between M2 and GO-APTS-containing membranes (M6-M8), you can find that the negative surface charges of the GO-APTS results in a significant decrease in membrane zeta potential.',\n",
       "  'Fig. 10 and Table 3 illustrate the AFM analysis (with 10 mm x 10 mm scanning area) of the membranes, by which roughness of the membranes can be evaluated. It is entirely apparent that the more surface roughness, the more permeation. Indeed, more surface roughness provides a higher contact surface area and, in this way, raises permeation. As presented in Table 3, it can be seen that TPU content raising induces more surface roughness. There is a correlation between porosity value and surface roughness [26]. Porosity values, presented in Table 1, demonstrate that the addition of TPU causes a higher amount of porosity and renders membranes with a rougher surface. By drawing a comparison between nanoparticle-containing membranes and the M2 membrane, it can be noticed that the presence of GO-APTS in the membranes (M6-M8) provides a smoother surface than the M2 membrane. It is observable in AFM images that after GO-APTS embedding, the large peaks and valleys have been changed to a smoother form. It is probably because of the steric interaction of GO-APTS and the PES/TPU matrix, which conducted the mixed matrix membranes toward the formation of lower surface roughness variations. The resulting data demonstrate that GO-APTS enhancement leads the membrane roughness to an irregular trend. In the first step, the membrane roughness of 0.1% wt and 0.3% wt GO-APTS have a descending trend. In the next step, there is an ascending trend in the membrane roughness due to the 0.5% wt GO-APTS addition.',\n",
       "  'Cross-sectional FESEM images of the prepared membranes have been displayed in Fig. 11. The sponge-like structure of the membranes, produced by the VIPS-NIPS technique, and the presence of finger-like structure in the M5 membrane, produced by the NIPS technique, demonstrate the differences between these two techniques in morphology [42]. The formation of the sponge-like and finger-like structures depends on the phase separation rate during the membrane fabrication. Exposure of the casted polymer solution to water vapor during the VIPS-NIPS process stimulates the membranes to form sponge-like structures by reducing the phase separation rate [62]. The FESEM images and the mean pore radius of the membranes, presented in Table 1, revealed that the top dense layer along with the suitable membrane pore sizes, created by the VIPS-NIPS technique, resulted in the optimal performance of the M2 membrane in water permeation and dye separation among the nanoparticle-free membranes (M0-M5).',\n",
       "  'It is quite obvious in Fig. 11 and Table 1 that TPU enhancement leads the membranes to enlarge the sponge-like pore size. As demonstrated in Fig. 11e, in the membrane containing 4% TPU, membrane morphological changes can be attributed to the phase separation of the polymer blend. Additionally, the hydrophilic character of GO-APTS raises the solvent and non-solvent exchanges and thus the phase separation rate. Hence, it is entirely evident that nanoparticle-containing membranes (M6-M8) have larger pores than the M2 membrane.',\n",

       "  'Fig. 13 exhibits the mechanical properties of the M0, M2, and M7 membranes. Due to the substantial differences in the mechanical properties of PES and TPU, what is logically expected is that the mechanical properties of the resulting blend will be very distinct. As demonstrated by the obtained data, the tensile strength of the prepared membrane has boosted by TPU addition (from 5.88 MPa for the M0 to 15.71 MPa for the M2 membrane). Moreover, the incorporation of TPU has been significantly increased the elongation at break of the prepared membrane (from 8.31% for the M0 to 23.1% for the M2 membrane). All the mentioned result originated from intrinsic tensile strength of TPU. Furthermore, it can be discerned in Fig. 13 that GO-APTS embedding has also improved the tensile strength and elongation at break of the fabricated membrane. Tensile strength has been enhanced from 15.71 MPa for the M2 to 19.79 MPa for the M7 membrane and elongation at break has been increased from 23.1% for the M2 to 27.2% for the M7 membrane. It is worth bearing in mind that the suitable strength of the quasi-2D compounds along with the appropriate interfacial interaction of GO-APTS and PES/TPU matrix has led the mechanical properties of the M7 membrane to extraordinary values [39,53].',\n",
       "  'Various factors can govern the performance of the membranes fabricated by the VIPS technique. Exposure time is one of the most important factors affecting membrane efficiency. According to Fig. 14, prolonging the exposure time dropped the permeation and boosted the ability of the M2 membrane in dye rejection. It is clearly obvious that there are no significant differences in the performance of the membrane with 0 and 5-second exposure times. By comparing the membranes with 15 and 30-second exposure times, we can find out that exposure time enhancement thickens the dense top layer of the membranes and it just diminishes the permeation with no considerable change in membrane separation performance [63].',\n",
       "  'All activities have been performed with the aim of removing common dyes such as MB, CV, MG, and DY-29. It is important to note that in addition to acceptable dye rejection, suitable permeation is another factor that is considered in evaluating membrane performance. As specified in Fig. 15, due to the increase in TPU content, the permeation has also increased, by which permeation of the M3 and M4 membranes have reached 7.38 and 26.45 L/m2.h.bar, respectively. It can be seen in the resulting dye removal data that the M3 and M4 membranes showed less than 80 and 30% dye removal performance, respectively. It is crystal clear that they have no qualification for choosing as the optimal membrane among nanoparticle-free membranes (M0-M5). Appropriate permeation and dye rejection of the M2 membrane led us to select it as the optimal membrane among nanoparticle-free membranes and improve its performance by embedding a suitable nanoparticle. Before studying nanoparticle-containing membranes, investigation of the differences between the membranes obtained from the VIPS-NIPS and NIPS techniques, M2 and M5, respectively, provides valuable information. By comparing the permeation and rejection of these two membranes, it is quite clear that the reduction of phase separation rate during the VIPS-NIPS process significantly affects membrane performance. As exhibited in Fig. 15, the performance of the M5 membrane in rejection of various dyes is in the range of 38.4 to 42.8%, but by changing the phase separation technique to the VIPS-NIPS one, it is observed in the M2 membrane that the dye rejection performance has demonstrated significant growth in the range of 93.8 to 97.4%. Indeed, the formation of a denser top layer, which is due to the reduction of the phase separation rate, leads the M2 membrane to improve dye removal performance.',\n",
       "  'The particular porous structure of GO and its derivatives creates plenty of extra channels for passing water molecules [64]. It needs to be mentioned that the well-defined interlayer space and well-ordered laminar structure of these compounds provide a substantial selectivity to separate dyes and other solutes from aqueous and non-aqueous solutions [65,66]. The mentioned factors, along with the high hydrophilicity of GO and its derivatives, make it to a promising candidate to embed in the membranes. According to the GO-APTS-containing membranes data, the permeation has increased from 4.29 to 5.08 L/m2.h.bar for the M6 and the M7 membranes, respectively. Nevertheless, this permeation enhancement did not diminish the dye removal ability of the M7 membrane. It is completely obvious in Fig. 15 that by increasing the GO-APTS content, from 0.1% wt to 0.3% wt, the ability of the membrane to remove all the dyes has been slightly enhanced. It can be ascribed to the lower mean pore radius of the M7 membrane than the M6 membrane.',\n",
       "  'Salts rejection data of all the fabricated membranes are presented in Fig. 16. As demonstrated in the related Figure, the ability of the prepared membranes in salt rejection was investigated using MgCl2, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 solutions at pH=7. It is absolutely apparent that nanoparticle-containing membranes exhibit higher performance in salt rejection. It stands to reason that the mentioned membranes have a more negative zeta potential and it causes creating more repulsion between the membranes and anions of salt solutions. Comparing the M2 and M7 membranes obviousely reveal the effect of charge repultion on the membrane ability in salt separation. As displayed in Fig. 16, the ability of the M2 membrane in MgCl2, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 separation is 25.7, 60.4, and 46.9% respectively and these values increased to 32.1, 71.4, and 62.4% in the M7 membrane, respectively. Examining the zeta potential values of these two membranes can reveal the reason of improving the separation ability of the M7 membrane. As specified in the obtained salt rejection data, the NF membranes have a higher rejection ability of divalent ions than monovalent ions and the rejection of that ions with higher ionic radius is higher. Hence, the resulting data disclosed that the membranes have more tendency to reject Na2SO4 and MgSO4 than MgCl2 and it is because of the more charge repulsion between membrane and SO42- divalent anions than membrane and Cl- monovalent anions. It is worth pointing out that the salts separation behavior of the prepared NF membrane in the current study is similar to NF membranes reported in literature [67,68].',\n",
       "  \"One of the most critical factors affecting membrane performance is the antifouling ability of the prepared membrane. Cake layer appearance and the presence of concentration polarization lead membranes to pore blocking. The main reason for the lack of adequate resistance of membranes against fouling is the hydrophobic nature of the membrane surfaces [69,70]. Researchers have found many solutions to solve this problem. Some of the most practical methods used to reduce membrane fouling are polymer blending, surface modification, and the incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticles [16,26,61]. Among these approaches, two ideas were carried out in our work to improve the antifouling property of the membranes. TPU adding and GO-APTS embedding, as two hydrophilic materials, have been utilized to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity in order to improve the antifouling properties of the membrane. As mentioned earlier, it is worth recalling that concentration polarization and protein's adsorption-deposition on the membrane surfaces lead the membranes to reversible fouling (Rr) and irreversible fouling (Rir), respectively. Indeed, reversible fouling is achieved due to loosely binding of the fouling agent with the membrane surface and irreversible fouling occurs by creating a tight attachment between them. It is necessary to mention that the loose and tight attachment of the foulant with the membrane surfaces can be wiped out with backwashing and chemical cleaning, respectively. Since both of these factors affect membrane performance, defining a third quantity called the total fouling ratio (Rt), seems to be necessary. This quantity is the sum of the reversible and irreversible fouling ratios [61]. According to the mentioned concepts, it is signified that the membrane antifouling performance is improved through Rt declining. Flux recovery ratio (FRR) is another parameter to study the antifouling characteristic of the membranes. It is necessary to emphasize that the higher FRR content exhibits better membrane antifouling ability.\",\n",
       "  'To evaluate the antifouling ability of the fabricated membranes, in the first step, the effect of TPU blending and in the next step, the effect of GO-APTS embedding have been investigated. As depicted in Fig. 17, all the antifouling parameters were improved through TPU blending due to the suitable hydrophilic nature of this polymer. It can be seen that the higher TPU content causes Rr enhancement and Rir reduction. The total fouling ratio was also declined and it proving the membrane antifouling ability enhancement. The FRR parameter has been enhanced by TPU increasing. The above results explicitly confirm the claim that TPU addition leads the membranes to improve membrane antifouling properties.',\n",
       "  'Despite the fact that TPU blending with PES has improved the antifouling performance of the membranes, by examining the parameters related to the M2 membrane fouling, it can be seen that by adding a suitable nanoparticle such as GO-APTS, the flux recovery ratio (FRR) values of the membranes have been considerably boosted and the total fouling (Rt) amounts were decreased. By making a comparison between the M2 membrane and nanoparticle-containing membranes (M6-M8), the dependence of membrane antifouling properties on membrane hydrophilicity is reaffirmed. It is crystal clear that the Rt of nanoparticle-containing membranes has been substantially diminished. In the membrane containing 0.3% wt GO-APTS (M7), Rt has declined to 53.2%, which is a significant decline compared to the M2 membrane. It can be seen that the irreversible fouling ratio (Rir) in the M7 membrane has been reduced to 7%. On the other hand, the obtained FRR values reveal that the recovery ability of the M7 membrane has reached 92.9%.',\n",

It can be discerned in Fig. 18 that both the TPU and GO-APTS have been enhanced the antifouling properties of the membranes. Moreover, Table 4 exhibits more information about the details of FRR and Rr content. Comparing the mentioned parameters of the M0 and M7 membranes reveals the effect of increase in hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes on the antifouling properties. It is absolutely evident in Table 4 that the lower reduction in FRR and Rr have been ocurred in the M7 membrane (7.6 and 6.5% for FRR and Rr, respectively) than the M0 membrane (15.0 and 10.9% for FRR and Rr, respectively) at the end of the third cycle.',\n",

It seems obvious in the respective diagram that the M7 membrane has superior ability in dye removal for a long time. Although, during a ten-day period, due to the dilution and fouling effect, the permeation has constantly diminished (about 44% after ten days), and the dye removal exhibits a negligible change at the end of this ten-day test. The results indicate that the M7 membrane efficiency, concerning dye removal, has not deteriorated over time.',\n",
       "  'Notable results can be obtained by drawing a comparison between the fabricated M7 membrane and other studies. According to Table 5, it can be seen that the optimized membrane of our article (M7) has extraordinary performance in dye removal.',\n",
       "  'Concisely, in this work, as specified by comparing M2 and M5 membranes, simultaneous usage of VIPS and NIPS techniques had a tremendous effect on the membrane performance by the formation of sponge-like structure and a dense top layer on the membrane. High hydrophilicity of the TPU led us to select it for blending with PES. Moreover, high porosity and the presence of numerous channels, along with a convincing selectivity of GO-APTS nanoparticles, persuaded us to utilize this nanoparticle in the mixed matrix membrane fabrication. Accordingly, diverse amounts of TPU and GO-APTS was utilized to prepare membranes. It was seen that both the TPU and GO-APTS significantly improved the tensile strength and elongation at break of the membranes. Furthermore, it was figured out that the membrane containing 2% wt TPU and 0.3% wt GO-APTS (M7 membrane) not only provided a superior dye removal performance (97.3%, 98.1%, 98.7%, and 99.4% for MB, CV, MG, and DY-29, respectively) but also possessed appropriate permeation (5.08 L/m2.h.bar). The excellent resistance of the M7 membrane against fouling was also obtained because of the excellent water contact angle of TPU and GO-APTS.',\n",

       "  'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common public health issues around the world due to its high morbidity, and millions of the patients die every year for lack of cost-efficient treatment [1]. Organ transplantation shows the best therapeutic effect so far and is used for CKD treatments especially in terminal stage. However, the high cost of organ transplantation is unaffordable for most CKD patients. The lack of donors and difficulty in organ matching also restrict the availability of organ transplantation. As a blood purification technology, hemodialysis has served as an alternative therapy for CKD since 1950s. Hemodialysis consists of a hemodialysis membrane-based dialyzer and a circulatory blood purification system, which together purify the blood coming from CKD patients and then circulate it back [2]. Hemodialysis is widely used among the dialysis and blood purification techniques because of relatively low cost and low treatment requirements. Moreover, as it is an extracorporeal process, side reactions seldom occur [3].',\n",
       "  'Hemodialysis membranes are the core unit in hemodialysis. They are porous membrane allowing the passage of water molecules and small solutes while rejecting macromolecules with certain molecular weights. A few artificial and synthetic polymers such as cellulose acetate (CA) [4,5], poly(lactic acid) (PLA) [6-8], polyethersulfone (PES) [1,9], polysulfone (PSF) [10-15], and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) [16], have been used to prepare hemodialysis membranes. Among these polymers, PSF is distinguished because of its excellent mechanical property, chemical durability, and processibility. Also importantly, PSF is one of the few biomaterials that can remain stable in all sterilization conditions (steam, ethylene oxide, and gamma radiation, etc.) [11]. Besides, PSF-based membranes show superior clearance rate to uremic toxins [17] and have become a prime choice for clinicians administering dialysis. However, the relatively hydrophobic nature of PSF tends to cause adsorption of proteins during the hemodialysis process, which can further lead to serious even life-threatening complications due to activation of the complement alternative pathway [18]. Protein deposition on the membranes during dialysis also deteriorates the permeability and rejection performances of membranes. In addition, the hydrophobicity of PSF usually results in relatively poor hemocompatibility, so anticoagulants are always employed during treatments in order to avoid clot formation [19,20].',\n",
       "  'Because of these issues, modification to PSF is usually prerequisite before it can be used in hemodialysis. To this end, different modification methods have been utilized. For instance, researchers have tried some surface modification techniques such as air-plasma glow discharge treatment on the pristine PSF membranes to improve their biocompatibility [11,21]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and heparin (Hep) were also grafted onto PSF membranes by plasma-induced surface modification to prepare PSF-PEG-Hep membranes [12]. However, constrained to the complexity of these modification methods, it is difficult to industrialize and apply to medical services. At the current stage, blending outstanding-biocompatibility additives with PSF to improve the biocompatibility of PSF-based membranes is the main method to prepare commercial hemodialysis membranes. PSF membranes blended with hydrophilic additives, including silibinin (SLB) [22], PSF-g-TPGS [13], and others [23,24], exhibited enhanced biocompatibility. Meanwhile, the additives can act as porogon. Although the hemodialysis performances of PSF-based membranes can be improved to some extent, the shear force between the circulating fluid and the hemodialysis membrane can lead to the wash-out of additives from the membrane surface during dialysis process, thus affecting the biocompatibility of the dialysis membrane [9,25]. Moreover, the types of hemodialysis membranes, sterilization method, storage period and preflush method can also cause the elution of additives [26-28]. Therefore, it is urgent to find a more effective and safe method to prepare PSF-based hemodialysis membranes.',\n",
       "  'In our previous work, we combined PEG blocks with PSF by copolymerization to enhance hydrophilicity, and thus produced PSF-b-PEG block copolymer was used to prepare ultrafiltration membranes by NIPS [29]. The prepared membranes showed upgraded surface hydrophilicity and consequently high permeability as well as good fouling resistance. To be noted, the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the prepared PSF-b-PEG membranes is around 42 kDa, where small/medium sized molecular toxins and macromolecular proteins can be separated. Meanwhile, as a hydrophilic and non-toxic polymer with high mobility and antifouling property to plasma proteins or platelets, PEG can improve the hemocompatibility and biocompatibility of PSF. Therefore, the hemodialysis performances of the PSF-b-PEG membranes are expected. In this study, we attempt to formulate dialysis-grade PSF-b-PEG membranes by NIPS without any additives or post-treatments. The morphology, permeance, solute rejection, hydrophilicity, protein adsorption, hemocompatibility and toxin clearance of the PSF-b-PEG membranes will be investigated.',\n",

       "  'Water contact angle (WCA) data of the PSF membrane and the PSF-b-PEG membranes with a PEG content of 21 wt% were firstly observed, as shown in Fig. 2. The WCAs of the PSF-b-PEG membranes prepared under different concentrations were close, ~62deg, which was lower than the WCAs of PSF membranes, ~86.5deg. The improvement of the membrane hydrophilicity was due to the incorporating of PEG chains into PSF. When the casting solutions were cast on glass plate and immersed in DI water, the hydrophilic PEG chains migrated to membrane surface. PEG microdomains had a diameter of ~20-30 nm and were three dimensionally interconnected with each other, forming a randomly distributed continuous phase in the PSF matrix [29]. Due to the biocompatibility of PEG, the PSF-b-PEG copolymer membranes have potential use to produce biologically inert surfaces.',\n",
       "  'When blood comes into contact with biomaterials, the first thing that happens is the adsorption of plasma protein. This is the foundation of platelet adhesion and activation of clotting, which further leads to thrombosis [30,31]. According to previous study, proteins prefer to be adsorbed onto hydrophobic materials. In the aqueous system, hydration on the surface of hydrophobic materials affects the subsequent protein adsorption process [16]. In this direction, hydrated protein molecules replace the interfacial water through electrostatic interactions to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium [32,33]. Consequently, membranes with hydrophilic surfaces are considered to have excellent anti-protein adsorption property. Static protein adsorption tests were conducted with BSA solution to study the biocompatibility of PSF-b-PEG membranes. During hemodialysis process, the upper surface of membrane is in contact with blood containing protein. Therefore, in order to avoid the influence of supporting layer, the BSA solution was only in contact with membrane surface by turning over the membrane. As shown in Fig. 3a, the BSA adsorptions on the surfaces of PSF-b-PEG membranes were at a similar lever, which were much lower than that of PSF membrane. Even for the membrane with highest BSA adsorption, the adsorption was only ~7.5 mg cm-2. SEM observation found that there was a large amount of BSA aggregated on the PSF membrane surface (Fig. 3 b). On the contrast, there were no obvious BSA aggregation on the PSF-b-PEG membrane surfaces as shown in Fig. 3 (c)-(g), which further demonstrates that the PSF-b-PEG membrane has excellent anti-protein adsorption ability.',\n",
       "  'As basic factors, relatively high permeability and precise selectivity are required for hemodialysis membranes. The ultrafiltration performances of the PSF-b-PEG membranes were also measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, with the increasing of copolymer concentrations, the permeance of the PSF-b-PEG membranes gradually decreased from ~400 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 to ~100 L m-2 h-1 bar-1. The decrease of membrane permeance was attributed to the increase of internal mass transfer resistance with the increasing of skin layer thickness (Fig. S1). The rejection to BSA increased when the copolymer concentration was within 21 wt% but decreased with the further increase of concentration. It is probably because that the too high concentration of the casting solution causes the change of phase separation behaviors of PSF-b-PEG in skin layer, which finally leads to the abnormal separation performance. The rejection to BSA reached the peak of ~93.2% and the permeance was ~210 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 when copolymer concentration was 21 wt% (the membrane is named as SFEG-21). For the PSF membrane, the permeance was ~0.5 L m-2 h-1 bar-1, which indicated a significant performance improvement by using PSF-b-PEG. As the molecular weight of BSA is ~66 kDa, which is similar to that of human serum protein (HSA), a protein existed in blood, the results of BSA rejections can refer to the retention of albumin present in blood during hemodialysis.',\n",
       "  'Hemodialysis membranes should act as a barrier for the transport of large proteins, while small and medium sized toxins can be filtered out. So MWCO is a very important parameter for hemodialysis membranes to check their selectivity. MWCO analysis of SFEG-21 was carried out and the result was shown in Fig. 4b. The MWCO of SFEG-21 was determined to be ~43 kDa, and the calculated pore size was approximately 6.2 nm, which further confirmed the potential use in hemodialysis. Besides, the rejection of SFEG-21 to LZM was ~10.7%, corresponding to previous results. As we known, dialysis-related amyloidosis is a common disease because of retention of middle molecular toxin, like, b-2 microglobulin (14000 Da). The clearance rate of middle molecular can be usually improved by increasing pore sizes, which decreases the risk of developing dialysis-related amyloidosis [34]. We note that high cutoff (HCO) can be used to get rid of cytokines and interleukins for patients suffering from sepsis, acute pancreatitis, and even multiple myeloma [35].',\n",
       "  'Cross-sectional and surface morphologies of the SFEG-21 membrane were characterized by SEM. According to Fig. 5 (a) and (b), SFEG-21 membrane exhibited a typical asymmetric finger-like pore structure composed of a dense skin layer and a highly porous sublayer featured as finger-like cavities, which was similar with PSF membrane (Fig. S2 (a) and (b)). The SFEG-21 surface image showed that the pores of the skin layer were too small to be represented by SEM, whilst the PSF membrane showed some small pores and gap structure on the membrane surface. Although there were some small spherical structures on SFEG-21 membrane surface, the integral membrane surface roughness was relatively low (Fig. S3). Low surface roughness can also avoid large amounts of protein adsorption [13].',\n",
       "  'Platelets play an important role in maintaining hemostasis while the aggregation of platelets in blood can promote thrombus formation. SEM images were used to study the platelet adhesion behavior on membrane surface. For hydrophobic surfaces, such as pristine PSF or PLA membranes [1,10], large amounts of platelets aggregated on membrane surface. As shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), there was obvious platelet adsorption on the whole PSF membrane surface. And the adhesion of platelets all exhibited reticulate pseudopodia structure, which indicated the activation of platelets. By contrast, only little platelet was observed on the SFEG-21 membrane surface (Fig. 6 (c) and (d)). PEG is well-known for its super anti-fouling ability to resist protein adsorption [11]. The presence of abundant ether bonds in PEG can tightly combine with water molecules via hydrogen bonding, forming a hydration layer near the surface. The hydration layer is a physical and energetic barrier to prevent the biocomponents from adsorption the polymer surface [36]. Therefore, for the PSF-b-PEG membrane, the PEG chains distributed on membrane surface allow an anti-protein surface, which efficiently suppress the adsorption and aggregation of platelets. Since PEG and PSF are covalently bonded, we can expect that this good anti-adsorption performance of the PSF-b-PEG membranes can be maintained for a long time rather than gradually declines along with the time.',\n",
       "  'PRT was used to observe clotting time or to determine the absence of clotting factors [37]. When the clotting factor VIII is activated, the thrombin is generated from the clotting progenitor through stepped-activity. After that, thrombin promotes the conversion of fibrinogen from plasma to fibrous protein, which is the basis of thrombus formation. Due to the addition of calcium ions and the activation of factors VIII, fibrous protein cross-links with each other and becomes stable and insoluble. According to the experiment results, the PRT of pristine PSF membrane was 311 +- 5 s. In addition, the PRT of SFEG-21 membranes was prolonged substantially to 409 +- 10 s compared with PSF membranes. The prolonged PRT indicated that the activation of fibrinogen on SFEG-21 membranes was inhibited, owing to the enhancement of membrane hydrophilicity because of PEG chains [38]. It is worth noting that the time is much higher than that of the modified hemodialysis membrane, such as polydopamine-coated PLA membranes (230 s-244 s) and heparin-immobilized PLA membranes (270 s-280 s) (Tab.1). All these results indicated that SFEG-21 membrane surface not only prevented platelets adhesion and weakened the damage to erythrocyte but also inhibited blood coagulation. By using PSF-b-PEG as the membrane material, the hemocompatibility showed significant improvement.',\n",
       "  'During hemodialysis, blood keeps flowing through the dialysis membranes. In this continuous process, erythrocytes may rupture and release hemoglobin (known as hemolysis) because of the interaction of erythrocytes with the membranes. HR is then employed to determine the extent of injury of the erythrocytes caused by the dialysis membranes. An HR below 5% is considered harmless by ASTMF-756-08 standard. In vitro hemolysis tests were employed on SFEG-21 membrane, and the HR of SFEG-21 was 0.48% +- 0.01%, not only much lower than 5%, but also lower than that of PSF membranes, which was 0.55% +- 0.03%. This result showed that PEG on the membrane surface could inhibit the release of hemoglobin from cells. In general, SFEG-21 membrane has excellent anti-hemolytic activity under this condition.',\n",
       "  'As shown in Table 1, with relatively high water flux, moderate BSA rejection and outstandingly low hemolysis ratio, the SFEG-21 membranes exhibit superior hemodialysis performances including hemocompatibility compared with other literature works and also commercial hemodialysis membranes. For example, compared to an extensively used commercial hemodialysis membrane (F60S, Fresenius), our SFEG-21 membrane exhibits nearly doubled flux while the rejection is similar. Also importantly, the hemolysis of the SFEG-21 membrane is much lower than the commercial one (0.48% vs. 1.6%). This is mostly because of the PEGylated surfaces and pore walls of the membranes. Besides, we note that the SFEG-21 membranes were fabricated by one-step NIPS process, without using any additives or post-treatments, which can also promote their potential applications in hemodialysis.',\n",
       "  'The dialysis performances were tested with a solution of urea, lysozyme and BSA as the simulating blood, and PBS solution was employed as the simulating dialysate. The solute clearance rate of urea, lysozyme and BSA were shown in Table 1. It was found that the SFEG-21 membranes showed good clearance to small molecules (urea) at 69.9 +- 5.1 mL/min and to medium molecules (lysozyme) at 46.4 +- 2.2 mL/min after dialysis tests for 6 h, which is close to that of the chemical modified PLA membrane (the urea clearance is over 70 mL/min and the lysozyme clearance is 40 mL/min) [7]. The good clearance of SFEG-21 is owing to their large pore size, excellent hydrophilic and interconnected membrane structure. It is worth noting that small and medium molecular toxins are removed while the beneficial large molecular proteins should be retained in dialysis [42]. The loss of BSA during the 6 h dialysis simulation is used to characterize the loss of beneficial proteins [43]. According to the experimental results, the loss of BSA of SFEG-21 membranes is 8.7 +- 0.6 mL/min. BSA molecules is described as a prolate ellipsoid with a molecular weight of about 66 kDa. The dimensions of BSA have been given as 14.1 nm for the major axis and 4.2 nm for the minor axis. The MWCO of SFEG-21 membrane is around 43 kDa, and the pore size of SFEG-21 is determined to be 6.2 nm, which is smaller than the major axis of BSA. Therefore, the membrane can retain most of the BSA in the dialysis simulation process.',\n",
       "  'As mentioned above, the possible leaching-out of additives can deteriorate membrane performances and even cause serious safety issues. Thus, the stability of additives is one of the most important properties of hemodialysis membranes. We characterized the surface PEG contents of the SFEG-21 membranes before and after a period of storage in water, to study the stability of PEG components. PSF/PEG blend membranes were chosen as the control group. For better comparison, the addition of PEG to PSF was 21 wt%, and the concentration of the casting solutions was fixed at 21 wt%. To avoid the possible influence of other contaminants during XPS analysis, the membranes were stored in DI water.',\n",
       "  'Specifically, the stability of the membranes was determined by characterizing the change of oxygen (O 1s) on the membrane surface before and after immersing in DI water for a certain time. O 1s was probed within the scope of 525.08-545.08 eV by narrow scan. The peak at the binding energy of 533.1 eV (Ph-O-Ph) and 531.6 eV (SO) was assigned to O 1s in PSF chains, and the peak at 532.3 eV (C-O-C) was derived from the O 1s of PEG chains [44]. Therefore, the ratio of the area of C-O-C peak to the area of O 1s peak (areaC-O-C) can indicate whether the PEG components are lost during use process. As shown in Fig. 7a, the areaC-O-C of SFEG-21 before and after immersion for three months did not change noticeably because of the covalent bonds between PEG chains and PSF chains. This result indicated the excellent stability of PEG in the SFEG-21 membranes. For PSF/PEG-21 membrane (Fig. 7b), although PEG was partially dissolved in NIPS process, it tended to accumulate on the surface of membrane due to the good hydrophilicity of PEG. Therefore, the areaC-O-C of PSF/PEG-21 before storage is comparable to that of SFEG-21 membranes. However, after three months of immersion, the areaC-O-C of PSF/PEG-21 decreased significantly, from 37.7% to 30.1%. This means that PEG of the blend membranes is easy to be washed out in operating process. By comparison, it can be found that the use of block copolymers as material can basically solve the problem of leaching-out in the process of operation and thus avoid the complications of patients.',\n",

The PSF-b-PEG hemodialysis membranes also had high urea and lysozyme clearance as well as low BSA clearance, which promises the removal of toxins and retention of beneficial proteins.

The solvents N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, r = 1.03 g/cm3), dimethylacetamide (DMAc, r = 0.940 g/cm3) and dimethylformamide (DMF, 0.944 g/cm3) of reagent grades were purchased from Uni-Onward Corp., Taiwan, while reagent grade 2-pyrrolidinone (2P, r = 1.12 g/cm3) was procured from Acros Organics. All the chemicals were used without further purification. DI water was produced in our lab using an Elga Purelab(r) water purification system.\n",

      "A typical casting solution was prepared by dissolving PSf polymer in 2P solvent. To prepare the pristine casting solutions, 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf polymer were added into the 2P solvent. Meanwhile, to prepare the modified casting solutions, respective amount (wt%) of non-solvent additive (water) was added into the bottle containing 2P, and mixed well for a couple of minutes. Followed by the addition of PSf polymer. The amount of water added was determined based on the cloud point experiment (section 2.2.3). All the casting solutions were dissolved at 60 degC in an oil bath for 1-2 days. Both the casting solutions and membranes are named as Px-Dy in which x and y denote the concentrations of PSf and additive in wt%, respectively. For instance, P8-D1.5 indicates 8 wt% of PSf and 1.5 wt% of DI water. As a point of comparison with different systems, casting solutions of PSf/NMP, PSf/NMP/water, PSf/DMAc, PSf/DMAc/water, PSf/DMF, and PSf/DMF/water were also prepared.\n",

      "Polymer solutions with PSF, PEG-4000, and different surfactants were prepared using DMAc as solvent and then was stirred at least 5 h at 343.15 K. The homogenous dope solutions were degassed at 343.15 K until no air bubbles existed. The homogenous dope solutions were evenly casted on a glass plate. Then, the glass plate was promptly immerged into coagulant (water) at 298.15 K. The resulting membrane was then reserved in tap water to clear out the remaining additives and solvent. The detailed compositions of the dope solutions are showed in Table 2.\n",

Commercial polyphenylsulfone (PPSU, Ultrason P3010 MR; Mw=35,000 g.mol-1) and polysulfone (PSf, Ultrason(r) 6010 P) were supplied via BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; k30), direct yellow, and Methyl Green were obtained from Merck, Germany. Methylene blue, 1,4-benzendicarboxylic acid, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, and Crystal Violet were supplied by PubChem.\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "Here, for enhancing the basil seeds purity, impurities washed away with DI water and ethanol, consecutively, and then, the seeds dried at 25 degC. Next, the purified basil seeds were soaked in DI water at 25 degC for 40 min, leading to swelling their outer layer as a gelatinous layer around the seeds. After that, in order to improve the extraction efficiency, NaOH solution (2%wt.) was added drop-wise into the BSM mixture solution under stirring until adjusting pH to 8, which was conducted for 9 h at 70 degC, after which the extracted BSM and the seeds were completely separated from each other. Eventually, using decantation and centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 20 min, BSM was separated. The mucilage hydrogel extraction process is shown in Scheme 1.\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "First, for the fabrication of the mixed matrix membranes, different amounts of the BSM hydrogel were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane/PVP mixtures, followed by sonication for 2 h to prepare homogeneous mixtures. In the next step, PPSf/PSf with a concentration of 18 wt% was added into the as-prepared mixtures and completely dissolved after continuously stirring at RT for 24 h. The homogenous polymer solution was de-gassed using a desiccator apparatus for 30 min and cast on a glass plate in a climatic box (relative humidity of 65 +- 5% and temperature 40 degC) for 10 s using a Doctor Blade device with a gap of 200 um (the VIPS step), and then, transferred to coagulation bath (the NIPS step). Finally, the prepared membranes were taken out of the bath and kept in DI water until conducting the separation tests. The neat membrane was also prepared by the same method, except that no BSM was added to the polymer mixture. The composition of casting solutions are exhibited in Table 1.\n",

By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50 degC (200 rpm), a homogeneous casting solution was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The PET NWF were cut into 16cm x 16 cm piece and then was poured and completely wet by a 30 g/L Zn (NO3) 2*6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF was then dried in oven at 30 degC for 0.5 h before use. The fully defoamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 mm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters 0f 14cm x 14 cm, and then immersed into a 50 degC deionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30 degC in an oven for 40 min and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing.\n",

      "The hydrothermally synthesis of MIL-53 (Al) was conducted according to the literature [30]. Accordingly, in the first step, Al(NO3)3*9H2O, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and DI water were mixed together with a molar ratio of 2:1:160. Subsequently, the as-prepared mixture was placed into a Teflon lined steel autoclave at the temperature of 220 degC for 72 h. After the accomplishment of the reaction, the steel autoclave was gradually cooled down to room temperature (RT). In the next step, a white product with the yield of 97%, based on the organic ligand, was achieved by centrifugation, followed via washing with DI water and drying in a vacuum oven at RT. Finally, the elimination of the excessive 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid which had been adsorbed in the pores was done by using heat treatment at 320 degC for 72 h in air.\n",

      "The PSf membranes were prepared by using vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) method coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) technique (VIPS-NIPS). It is well-known that the addition of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer solution along with applying an evaporation step before immersing the as-cast films into a coagulation bath have been reported for the successfully formation of integrally skinned asymmetric membranes [30]. Hence, a mixture of DMF, as the solvent, and 1,4-dioxane, as the volatile co-solvent, at a 3:1 wt ratio was utilized in this study for the fabrication of dope solutions. Accordingly, precise amounts of MIL-53(Al) were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed by sonication for 180 min in order to prepare homogeneous dispersions. In the next step, PSf with a concentration of 18 wt% was added into the as-prepared dispersions, and completely dissolved after continuously stirring at RT for 2 days. The MIL-53(Al) loading in the final dopes varied from 0 to 7 mg/g of MIL-53(Al) (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 mg/g). The homogenous polymer solution was de-aerated by using a vacuum process for 120 min and cast on a glass plate in a climatic box (relative humidity of 65 +- 5% and temperature 40 degC) by using a Doctor Blade device with a gap of 200 um. Only the MNIPS sample was formed by the NIPS process, and the other membranes were formed by the VIPS-NIPS method. By the coagulation step, the fabricated PSf membranes were separated from the glass plate. The fabricated membranes were stored in a soaking bath containing DI water for 1 day for the complete elimination of the residual solvent, followed by drying at RT. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4, according to the weight percentage of MIL-53(Al). The neat PSf membrane with 0 wt% of MIL-53(Al) was fabricated as the neat membrane and was labelled as M0. Furthermore, to draw a comparison, a membrane was also fabricated by the NIPS method, labelled as MNIPS. The compositions of the casting solutions are exhibited in Table 1.\n",

      "The sol-gel method was applied with some modifications to synthesize the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite [40,41]. Firstly, 25 g of SiO2 was constantly mixed in a 125 mL NaOH 2 M for 2 h at 150 degC. After the mixture cooled down, it was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman No. 42) to separate the undissolved SiO2 from the mixture. Then, 1.25 g of ZnO and 1.25 g of MnO2 were added to 25 mL of the filtrate solution, and it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed into an ultrasonic homogenizer at a frequency of 50 kHz for 60 min in order to get better particle dispersions. Dilute solution containing HCl 1 M was added dropwise into the mixture under constant stirring until the mixture turned into gels. The gels were left overnight for the compaction process. Subsequently, the spent solution was removed from the gels using a vacuum filter, and the damp gels were dried in an oven at 110 degC for 12 h. The dried gels were calcinated in a furnace at 500 degC for 5 h to remove the remaining organic substances and bonded water molecules and activate the photocatalysts.

Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife.

      "A casting solution with the composition near the binodal curve was more likely to form a membrane with bicontinuous structure because it had more chance to enter the unstable region rapidly or directly [18]. Thus, a precritical casting solution was prepared in this work. Meanwhile, according to the work by Li et al. [33], SPSf had a great compatibility with polyethersulfone (PESU) at the ratio of 16:84. In consideration of PPSU and PESU both belong to sulfone polymers, the same ratio was adopted in this work. At the same time, a low concentration of polymer would be good for the formation of a membrane with a high permeability so 15 wt% would be a good choice for this work. The steps for preparation of such a precritical casting solution were as followed:\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "First, a certain amount of DMAc was added into the flask, and then different weight percentage of water staring from 0% and then increasing by 0.5% at a time was dropped into DMAc. Afterwards, PPSU (12.6 wt%), SPSf (2.4 wt%) and 20 g PVP (20 wt%, calculated by extra method) were dissolved in DMAc (decreasing from 85 wt% by 0.5 wt% a time) and mixed thoroughly under constant stirring for enough time until a homogeneous solution was formed if possible. The water weight percentage of the casting solution which cannot form homogeneous solution was recorded. Finally, the casting solution prior to the cloudy one was defined as precritical casting solution. To further investigate the properties of the above-mentioned polymer solution, the viscosity and the light transmittance were obtained by a rotational rheometer (Physica MCR-301, Austria) and UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, USA).\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "The formation conditions of membranes are presented in Table 1. PPSU and SPSf were dried in vacuum oven at 80 degC for 24h before being used. The polymers and additives were dissolved in DMAc under constant stirring at 70 degC until a homogeneous solution was formed. The solution was allowed to settle and cool to room temperature followed by degassing. The solution then was casted onto a glass plate by hands using a casting knife (Biuged BD201, China) with a gap height of 200 mm and immediately transferred to a programmable humidity and temperature tester (BPS-50CL, China) with the condition of 25 degC and 100% relative humidity (RH) for a period of time (from 0 to 30 s). Both air humidity and exposure time can influence the water adsorption into the membrane. And the adsorbed water in the pristine film from the air essentially influenced the porous structure evolution. Herein we varied the exposure time in 100% humidity to better control the water intrusion into the membrane. After that, the glass plate was immediately taken out and immersed into water coagulation bath maintained at 25 degC until the membrane was peeled off from the glass plate. The resulted membranes were transferred into a fresh deionized water bath at room temperature for 24h, and dried in air before testing and analysis.\n",

Accordingly, in the first step, Al(NO3)3*9H2O, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and DI water were mixed together with a molar ratio of 2:1:160. Subsequently, the as-prepared mixture was placed into a Teflon lined steel autoclave at the temperature of 220 degC for 72 h. After the accomplishment of the reaction, the steel autoclave was gradually cooled down to room temperature (RT). In the next step, a white product with the yield of 97%, based on the organic ligand, was achieved by centrifugation, followed via washing with DI water and drying in a vacuum oven at RT. Finally, the elimination of the excessive 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid which had been adsorbed in the pores was done by using heat treatment at 320 degC for 72 h in air. The PSf membranes were prepared by using vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) method coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) technique (VIPS-NIPS). It is well-known that the addition of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer solution along with applying an evaporation step before immersing the as-cast films into a coagulation bath have been reported for the successfully formation of integrally skinned asymmetric membranes [30]. Hence, a mixture of DMF, as the solvent, and 1,4-dioxane, as the volatile co-solvent, at a 3:1 wt ratio was utilized in this study for the fabrication of dope solutions. Accordingly, precise amounts of MIL-53(Al) were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed by sonication for 180 min in order to prepare homogeneous dispersions. In the next step, PSf with a concentration of 18 wt% was added into the as-prepared dispersions, and completely dissolved after continuously stirring at RT for 2 days. The MIL-53(Al) loading in the final dopes varied from 0 to 7 mg/g of MIL-53(Al) (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 mg/g). The homogenous polymer solution was de-aerated by using a vacuum process for 120 min and cast on a glass plate in a climatic box (relative humidity of 65 +- 5% and temperature 40 degC) by using a Doctor Blade device with a gap of 200 um. Only the MNIPS sample was formed by the NIPS process, and the other membranes were formed by the VIPS-NIPS method. By the coagulation step, the fabricated PSf membranes were separated from the glass plate. The fabricated membranes were stored in a soaking bath containing DI water for 1 day for the complete elimination of the residual solvent, followed by drying at RT. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4, according to the weight percentage of MIL-53(Al). The neat PSf membrane with 0 wt% of MIL-53(Al) was fabricated as the neat membrane and was labelled as M0. Furthermore, to draw a comparison, a membrane was also fabricated by the NIPS method, labelled as MNIPS. The compositions of the casting solutions are exhibited in Table 1.\n",

      "Three kinds of PET NWFs named as NWF-01, NWF-02 and NWF-03 (PET, Hirose Co., Japan) were purchased for support fabrication. Commercial HT PSf ultrafiltration membrane named as PSf-HT were pruchased from VONTR (PSf, Beijing VONTRON Co., LTD, China). Polysulfone (PSf, P-3500 LCD MB7, Mw = 77,000-83,000 g/mol, Solvay, Belgium) was chosen to fabricate the membrane. N, N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc, Mw = 87.12 g/mol, Peking Reagent, China) was used as the solvent and polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw = 400 g/mol, MERYER, China) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 8000 g/mol, Innochem, China) were used as the additive in the casting solution. Deionized (DI) water was obtained using a Merck Mili-Q purification system among the whole experiment. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mw = 67,000 g/mol, Macklin, China) dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0-7.2) was used to evaluate membrane rejection. The concentration of BSA in the solution was 1000 ppm. All reagents were utilized directly without further treatment. The casting solution was composed of 19 wt% PSf, 7 wt% PEG, 0.5 wt% PVP and 73.5 wt% DMAc which were filled into a 500 mL flask. Then, the flask was heated to 95 degC by an oil bath. The homogenous casting solution was obtained after continuous stirring for 7 h at 2600 rpm (DF-101S Collective thermostatic heating magnetic stirrer, Shanghai Zhenjie Experimental Equipment Co., China). Lastly, the resulting casting solution was put into a vacuum oven at 25 degC for at least 24 h. PSf support membranes were prepared via NIPS method. NWFs were attached to the steel plate and then the dope solution was casted uniformly by an automatic film applicator (Elcometer 4340 Automatic Film Applicator, Elcometer Co., England) with a steel knife. The relative humidity was determined by adjusting the intensity of automatic humidifier (SC-3K40 air humidifier, Midea Group, China) and using indoor humidity measuring instrument (LondiSun LS-207 electronic moisture meter, Shanghai Diyi Zhan Trading Co., China). The nascent membranes were exposed to atmosphere for several seconds and then soaked into the coagulating bath with different temperature for 30 min to proceed the phase inversion. The prepared membranes were kept in DI water before test. The PSf membranes formed on three different PET NWFs (NWF-01, NWF-02 and NWF-03) were denoted as PSf-NWF-01, PSf-NWF-02, and PSf-NWF-03 membranes, respectively.\n",

      "Polysulfone (PSf, 99 %) pellets (UDEL (r) PSU P-1700 NT) as the polymeric membrane material was obtained from Solvay Advanced Materials, USA. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99.9 %) as the solvent to dissolve the PSf pellet was supplied by Merck, Germany. Silicon dioxide (SiO2, 99 %), zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO, 99 %), and manganese oxide (MnO2, 99 %) nanoparticles were provided by Nano Center Indonesia. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 98 %) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36 %) as required chemicals in the sol-gel process were obtained from Merck, Germany. Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, 99 %) for COD measurement and HACH 183,699 test kit for phenol content analysis were purchased from Meditek Sarta, Indonesia. HI3824-025 for ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) analysis was supplied from Hanna Instruments, Singapore. Analytical grades of oxalic acid (H2C2O4, 99 %), benzoquinone (C6H4O2, 99 %), and methanol (CH3OH, 99 %) for trapping test were obtained from Mada Kimia, Indonesia. Deionized (DI) water was used in chemical solution preparation and all experiment. The sample of natural rubber-laden wastewater (NRW) was collected from PTPN VII, located in Bengkulu, Indonesia. The detailed characteristics of the wastewater are presented in Table 1. The sol-gel method was applied with some modifications to synthesize the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite [40,41]. Firstly, 25 g of SiO2 was constantly mixed in a 125 mL NaOH 2 M for 2 h at 150 degC. After the mixture cooled down, it was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman No. 42) to separate the undissolved SiO2 from the mixture. Then, 1.25 g of ZnO and 1.25 g of MnO2 were added to 25 mL of the filtrate solution, and it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed into an ultrasonic homogenizer at a frequency of 50 kHz for 60 min in order to get better particle dispersions. Dilute solution containing HCl 1 M was added dropwise into the mixture under constant stirring until the mixture turned into gels. The gels were left overnight for the compaction process. Subsequently, the spent solution was removed from the gels using a vacuum filter, and the damp gels were dried in an oven at 110 degC for 12 h. The dried gels were calcinated in a furnace at 500 degC for 5 h to remove the remaining organic substances and bonded water molecules and activate the photocatalysts. Then, it was crushed using a planetary ball mill machine, and the product was sieved to get finer powders. The composite membranes were fabricated by referring to the (NIPS) process [42,43]. Table 2 shows the variation of membrane compositions prepared in this study. In the beginning, a certain amount of PSf pellets were mixed into a 50 mL of NMP solvent until the PSf pellets wholly dissolved. Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife. Then, the casted solution was immersed in a DI water bath to form the membrane sheets, and it was left for 24 h to remove the spent solvent inside the membrane. Finally, membrane sheets were dried at an ambient condition.\n",

      "Polysulfone (PSf, Ultrason S 6010, Mn = 55*kg mol-1, BASF), polyethylene glycol (PEG-400, Mn = 0.4 kg mol-1, BASF) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc, 99%, BASF) were used for membrane preparation without prior purification. Polyacrylic acid (PAA, Mn = 250*kg mol-1, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solutions were used for membrane surface modification and served as a coagulation bath. PAA concentrations in the coagulation bath were 0.4; 0.7; 1.0; 1.2; 1.5; 2.0 wt%. PAA solutions were prepared by dissolving selected amounts of PAA in distilled water at room temperature for 1 h using a magnetic stirrer.\n",

      "The polymer solution preparation technique was described in [40]. Polymer solution (20 wt% PSf, 10 wt% PEG-400 and 70 wt% DMAc) was applied on a glass plate using a casting knife with a gap height of 250 um at the room temperature. Distilled water and PAA aqueous solutions (0.4-2.0 wt%) were used as the coagulation bath during membrane preparation via NIPS. PAA concentrations in the coagulation bath and corresponding membrane abbreviations are presented in Table 2. Membranes were kept in distilled water at least for 24 h to remove the residual solvent. The time of membrane formation in NIPS was determined as the time from the moment of immersion of a nascent polymer film into the coagulation bath to the moment, when the precipitated membrane completely separates from the glass plate. Membrane formation time was determined for different coagulation bath compositions at T = 25 degC (Table 2).\n",

      "PSF-b-PEG block copolymers were obtained from Nanjing Bangding. The polydispersive index (PDI) was ~2.00, and the PEG block had a molecular weight of ~20 kDa, as provided by the manufacturer. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the PEG content was 21 wt%. PSF (average molecular weight 22000 Da) were obtained from Solvay. PEG and urea (AR) were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Bio.-Chem. Technology Co., LTD. Calcium chloride anhydrous (CaCl2, AR) and sodium chloride (NaCl, AR) were purchased from Xilong Scientific, LDC. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, >= 99.0%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., LTD. Lysozyme from egg white (LZM, 40000 U/mg) and p-Diaminobenzaldehyde (PDAB, AR) were obtained from Macklin. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, purity > 97%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) tablets were obtained from MP Biomedicals, LLC. All chemicals were employed as received. Deionized (DI) water was prepared in the laboratory. In order to fabricate homogeneous casting solutions (17 wt% to 25 wt%), a certain amount of PSF-b-PEG was added to NMP at 60 degC for enough time. Then mechanical stirring device was employed to ensure that the solutes were dissolved completely. The casting solution was deaerated overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 degC and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The casting solutions were scraped on the glass plate with a spatula to fabricate 300 mm-thick films. The films were placed in environment for several seconds before being put in deionized water. Then the membranes were rinsed with deionized water thoroughly to remove the remaining solvent and placed in deionized water for later use. The process for preparing PSF or PSF/PEG blending membranes was the same as above, except that the casting solution was composed of 18 wt% PSF and 82 wt% NMP or 16.6 wt% PSF, 4.4 wt% PEG and 79 wt% NMP.\n",

      "PPSU (P875330, Mw = 54,634 g/mol), n-hexane were purchased from Macklin (China) and SPSf (25% sulfonation degree) was supplied by Shandong Jinlan special polymer Co., Ltd. (China). PVP K30 and isooctane were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). DMAc, nano-silica, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5, water solubility is 17 mg/L [40]) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were all purchased from Aladdin (China). Deionized water was used as nonsolvent additive and coagulation bath. A casting solution with the composition near the binodal curve was more likely to form a membrane with bicontinuous structure because it had more chance to enter the unstable region rapidly or directly [18]. Thus, a precritical casting solution was prepared in this work. Meanwhile, according to the work by Li et al. [33], SPSf had a great compatibility with polyethersulfone (PESU) at the ratio of 16:84. In consideration of PPSU and PESU both belong to sulfone polymers, the same ratio was adopted in this work. At the same time, a low concentration of polymer would be good for the formation of a membrane with a high permeability so 15 wt% would be a good choice for this work. The steps for preparation of such a precritical casting solution were as followed: First, a certain amount of DMAc was added into the flask, and then different weight percentage of water staring from 0% and then increasing by 0.5% at a time was dropped into DMAc. Afterwards, PPSU (12.6 wt%), SPSf (2.4 wt%) and 20 g PVP (20 wt%, calculated by extra method) were dissolved in DMAc (decreasing from 85 wt% by 0.5 wt% a time) and mixed thoroughly under constant stirring for enough time until a homogeneous solution was formed if possible. The water weight percentage of the casting solution which cannot form homogeneous solution was recorded. Finally, the casting solution prior to the cloudy one was defined as precritical casting solution. To further investigate the properties of the above-mentioned polymer solution, the viscosity and the light transmittance were obtained by a rotational rheometer (Physica MCR-301, Austria) and UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, USA). The formation conditions of membranes are presented in Table 1. PPSU and SPSf were dried in vacuum oven at 80 degC for 24h before being used. The polymers and additives were dissolved in DMAc under constant stirring at 70 degC until a homogeneous solution was formed. The solution was allowed to settle and cool to room temperature followed by degassing. The solution then was casted onto a glass plate by hands using a casting knife (Biuged BD201, China) with a gap height of 200 mm and immediately transferred to a programmable humidity and temperature tester (BPS-50CL, China) with the condition of 25 degC and 100% relative humidity (RH) for a period of time (from 0 to 30 s). Both air humidity and exposure time can influence the water adsorption into the membrane. And the adsorbed water in the pristine film from the air essentially influenced the porous structure evolution. Herein we varied the exposure time in 100% humidity to better control the water intrusion into the membrane. After that, the glass plate was immediately taken out and immersed into water coagulation bath maintained at 25 degC until the membrane was peeled off from the glass plate. The resulted membranes were transferred into a fresh deionized water bath at room temperature for 24h, and dried in air before testing and analysis.\n",

      "Paragraph: The preparation of chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) was done based on the literature [28] (Scheme 1). Accordingly, PSf (10 g) was introduced into a flask, which was equipped with a reflux condenser, containing chloroform (500 mL), followed by stirring in order to form a homogenous solution. In the next step, paraformaldehyde (6.79 g) and trimethylchlorosilane (24.7 g) were gradually introduced into the above-mentioned PSf solution. Next, stannic chloride (0.6 mL) was slowly introduced into the as-fabricated mixture solution, followed by heating at 55 degC for 2 days. In the final step, the preparation of CMPSf was done through pouring the as-fabricated mixture solution into a methanol bath, followed via drying at 40 degC for 48 h at a vacuum oven.(Schemes 2 and 3). Fumed Silica (0.5 g) was added into 100 mL of Ethanol/deionized water (9:1) solution under sonication, followed via the addition of 1 mL of APTES under stirring at 60 degC for 24 h so that amino-functionalized silica NPs (NH2-SiO2) can be successfully fabricated. The reaction was carried out under N2 gas in a three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a heating system. In the next step, at 9000 rpm, the prepared suspension was centrifuged for 50 min, followed by re-dispersing the precipitates in ethanol by using an ultrasonic bath. The suspension was consecutively purified with ethanol and water for four times, followed via drying under reduced pressure at 65 degC. Vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) approach was utilized for the synthesis of the mixed matrix membranes. It is well-known that in this approach, membranes can be formed through incorporating of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer dope solution and, subsequently, conducting an evaporation stage before dipping the cast membranes into the coagulation non-solvent bath [13,17,29]. Accordingly, dimethylformamide (as the solvent) and 1,4-dioxane (as the volatile co-solvent) were mixed together at a weight ratio of 3:1 and utilized for the fabrication of the dope solutions. For this purpose, precise amounts of NH2-SiO2 were first introduced into the as-prepared dimethylformamide/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed via sonicating for 60 min in order to produce homogeneous solution mixtures. Then, CMPSf (20 wt% concentration) was introduced into the as-prepared dispersions, followed by entirely dissolving through stirring at 25 degC for 1 day [5]. The NH2-SiO2 loading amounts in the dope solutions varied between 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/g of NH2-SiO2/CMPSf. To fabricate the membranes, the as-prepared homogeneous polymer solution was left overnight to disengage air bubbles before membrane casting and then cast on a glass plate by using a Doctor Blade with a gap of 250 um, then put in a climatic box for 60 s (relative humidity of 65 +- 10% and temperature 40 degC). After the coagulation step, the prepared CMPSf membrane was spontaneously separated from the glass plate through the solvent-nonsolvent exchange. The fabricated membranes were kept in a bath containing DI water for 1 day so that the elimination of the residual solvent can be accomplished, followed via drying at 25 degC. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M1, M2, M3 and M4, classified according to the weight percentage of NH2-SiO2. The neat CMPSf membrane with 0% NH2-SiO2 was also fabricated as the blank membrane and was labelled as M0 (Fig. S1). The compositions utilized for the preparation of the casting solution are exhibited in Table 1.\n"

      "Paragraph: PVC resin (Mw = 81,000 g*mol-1) was obtained from Qilu Petrochemical Company, China. Sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) with different sulfonation degree (SD) of 20% (Mw = 68,000 g*mol-1), 30% (Mw = 65,000 g*mol-1) and 50% (Mw = 63,000 g*mol-1), purchased from Tianjin Yanjin Technology Co. Ltd., China, were used as the membrane additives. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs, Mw = 400, 10 k, 20 k, 35 k, and 100 k Da) and polyethylene oxide (PEO, Mw = 600 k Da) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Reagent Co., USA. PEG 400 was used as the pore-forming agent in the casting solution, and PEG 20 k was used to tune the viscosity of the casting solution. PEGs (Mw = 10 k, 35 k, and 100 k Da) and PEO (Mw = 600 kDa) were used as probe molecules for the determination of the membrane pore size and its distribution. Dimethylacetamide (DMAc, AR, >99.5%) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., China. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, BR, 98%, Mw = 67 k Da, Aladdin Reagent Co., China), sodium alginate (SA, AR, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich Reagent Co., USA) and humic acid (HA, AR, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich Reagent Co., USA) were applied as the simulated organic foulants. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR, 36%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR, >99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Cor., China. All other solvents and reagents were analytical grade. Deionized (DI) water (pH  6.5) was produced from reverse osmosis systems and used in all experiments. Pristine PVC and PVC/SPSF blend membranes were fabricated by NIPS process. The recipes for various casting solutions are listed in Table 1. The detailed fabrication procedure is described as follows. PVC resin and a series of PVC/SPSF blend were first dissolved in DMAc by stirring at 60 degC for 8 h to form homogeneous casting solutions, respectively. Viscosity of the casting solution was measured by Brookfield viscometer (DV2T, Germany) with a shear rate of 100 s-1 at 60 degC. All viscosity data were averaged from three independent measurements, as shown in Table 1. After releasing bubbles under reduced pressure, obtained casting solution was spread onto a neat glass plate via a casting knife with the thickness of 250 um, and then immersed in the coagulation bath (i.e. DI water, 30 degC). Finally, the membrane was rinsed thoroughly with DI water to remove residual solvent and soluble additives, and stored in DI water for subsequent characterization.\n",

Chlorotrimethylsilane and 1,3,5-trioxane were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). 4'-aminobenzo-12-crown-4 (AB12C4) was prepared according to the previous work [35]. All of the other reagents were analytical grade from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China). The chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) was prepared according to the previous work [33,34]. Typically, PSf (18 g) was dissolved in CHCl3 (500 mL). Chlorotrimethylsilane (60 mL), 1,3,5-trioxane (15 g), and SnCl4 (0.6 mL) were added to the PSf solution. The mixture was kept at 50 degC for 18 h with stirring. Once the reaction solution complete, the mixture was poured into ethanol to obtain the cotton-shaped polymer, which is the crude CMPSf. The pure CMPSf product with a degree of substitution (DS, determined by 1H NMR spectrum [36]) of 0.3 is obtained by dissolving and re-precipitating the crude CMPSf multiple times. The CMPSf dense membrane was prepared by the solvent evaporation. CMPSf (4 g) and PEG-4000 (4 g) were dissolved in DMF (18.2 mL).

BSA, a natural foulant, was provided by Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany. Reactive Green 19 (RG19) dye with a molecular weight of 1419 g mol-1 was purchased from Azar Dye Co., Iran. Deionized water was used as a nonsolvent. For the synthesis of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles, hyperbranched PEI with a molecular weight of 60,000 g mol-1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany. Epoxy silane coupling agent, [3-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-propyl]-trimethoxy silane (EPPTMS), ammonium hydroxide (32%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol, and dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Merck Co., Germany. All chemicals were used as-received. SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using the Stober method (Jouyandeh et al., 2018, 2019). Specifically, 50 mL ethanol was mixed with 3 mL ammonia solution for 10 min. Next, TEOS was added to the solution in the amount of 4 mL, followed by mixing of the solution for 24 h at the ambient temperature. The final synthesized nanoparticles were separated from the mixture by centrifugation (Hettich, Universal 320) at 6000 rpm for 10 min, repeatedly washed with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight. In the first step, silane-modified SiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by mixing 2 g SiO2 and 1.5 mL EPPTMS in 25 mL DMF at 80 degC for 24 h. The resulting nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation, washed with DMF, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight. In the second step, 2 g PEI was dissolved in 50 mL DMF and 2 g silane-modified SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the mixture under continuous stirring for 24 h at 80 degC. The resulting yellowish-color PEI functionalized SiO2 (PEI-SiO2) nanoparticles were finally separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, repeatedly washed with ethanol and DMF solvents, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight. Asymmetric flat-sheet PEI-SiO2/PSF nanocomposite membranes were fabricated using the NIPS method (Amiri et al., 2020). In the first step, membrane casting solutions were prepared by incorporating synthesized PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the amounts of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% based off of the PSF weight in the DMAc solvent under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Next, the suspension was sonicated (Bandelin ultrasonic bath, SONOREX) for 30 min until it was homogenous. After sonication, 1 wt% PVP was dissolved in the PEI-SiO2/DMAc mixture under magnetic stirring for 1 h. Upon completion of mixing, 18 wt% PSF was combined with the prepared mixtures under constant stirring at room temperature for 12 h. The resulting homogenous PSF/PVP/DMAc/PEI-SiO2 membrane casting solutions were next exposed to a temperature of 60 degC for 3 h to eliminate gas bubbles. After slow cooling of the casting solutions at room temperature for 30 min, membranes were cast on very clean and dry glass plates using a 150 mm thick stainless steel home-made casting knife. Finally, the glass plates were immersed in a coagulation bath of deionized water at 25 degC. For comparison purposes, neat PSF and SiO2/PSF membranes were also fabricated using the same procedures as those outlined above. Steps for the fabrication of PEI-SiO2/PSF nanocomposite membranes are illustrated in Fig. 1. Characterization methods of the nanoparticle and the membranes were presented in Supplementary Information.\n"

According to our previously reported work, the sulfobetaine-containing polymer PESSB was synthesized via polycondensation and quaternization. We designed and synthesized a series of copolymers containing diblocks of PESTA and PSF for post-treatment of hydrophilization modification. A facile one-pot method was used to prepare copolymer PSF-PESTA. By varying the molar ratio of diphenol monomers, we were able to prepare PSF-PESTA50 and PSF-PESTA67 containing 50% and 67% tertiary amine groups respectively. The synthetic route of the copolymer is shown in Fig. 3. PSF-PESTA50 and PSF-PESTA67 were converted to PSF-PESSB50 and PSF-PESSB67 by quaternization with sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate (SBES), respectively.

A conversion of about 41% of acrylic double bonds was achieved after one minute of irradiation under nitrogen (Table 3). The limited acrylic double bond conversion could be attributed to a limited mobility in the PSU membrane (the Tg is around 178degC, in accordance with the data reported in literature for pristine PSU). In order to increase the acrylic double bond conversion, the reverse sequence was applied, involving first the crosslinking reaction and subsequently the phase inversion of the crosslinked matrix.

Polymer and additive composition for the substrates are described in Table 1. First, a 0.075 wt% TiO2 from a 2 wt% stock solution and a calculated amount of water were dispersed in DMAc through ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, PES, SPSf and PEG polymers were dissolved in DMAc and mixed with TiO2 NPs under continuous stirring at 50 +- 1 degC for 12 h to form homogenous casting solutions. After degasification at the same temperature, the solutions were cast onto a clean glass plate substrate using an automated membrane applicator (Elcometer 4340, England) with a casting knife set at 200 mm gap thickness and then immediately immersed in a deionized water bath (+-1 degC). The prepared membranes were stored in deionized water for 24 h before coating to ensure complete solvent removal.\n",

      "Paragraph: Preliminary experiments were first conducted to determine the optimum concentration of PEI (0.025 wt%), volume and post-treatment parameters to use. This was followed by investigating the optimal crosslinking concentration for GA to utilize. Briefly, 10 mL of 0.025 wt% PEI was deposited onto a 16.6 cm2 PES/SPSf/TiO2 substrate sample under 0.09 MPa vacuum pressure. The coated membrane was then thoroughly rinsed with 100 mL of DI water. After rinsing, 10 mL of GA at different concentrations was deposited and allowed to crosslink with PEI at 50 degC for 45 min. Following this, the membrane was rinsed with DI water to remove unreacted groups and dried at 50 degC for 3 min as shown in Scheme 1. The membranes were then stored in pure water for later use. The compositions of the PEI/GA coating layer are listed in Table S1 as MG0- MG0.1 . Chemical group, morphology and performance characterization techniques were utilized to establish that the optimum crosslinking concentrations for PEI and GA were PEI 0.025 wt%:GA 0.05 wt% i.e. MG0.05. The hybrid layer was constructed by initially sonicating varying concentrations of TiO2 NPs dispersion (0.01-0.1 wt%) in optimal aqueous PEI solution for 1 h. 10 mL of the resulting PEI-TiO2/GA solution was deposited on the MMMs substrate using vacuum filtration. Following, 10 mL of optimum GA concentration (0.05 wt%) was used to crosslink the PEI-TiO2/GA layers at 50 degC for 45 min. Finally, the generated PEI-TiO2/GA@PES/SPSf/ TiO2 composite membranes were rinsed and dried as previously described. A breakdown of PEI-TiO2/GA and GA concentrations used to coat the membranes is described in Table 2. From Table S1, MG0.05 was renamed to M1 (0 wt% TiO2) . The rest of the PEI-TiO2/GA hybrid coated membranes with different concentrations of TiO2 NPs (0.01-0.1 wt%) were labeled M2-M6, respectively, as displayed in Table 2.\n",

Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99%) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5%) that were used in the sol-gel process were also obtained from Mada Kimia, Indonesia. The HI3824-025 test kit for ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) content measurement was purchased from Hanna Instruments, Singapore. The HACH 183699 as the test kit reagent for phenol measurement, as well as the pure phenol (C6H5OH, 99%), were obtained from Meditek Sarta, Indonesia.

The specimen of petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) used in this study was collected from the refinery plant of PT. Pertamina (persero), Cilacap, Central Java, Indonesia, as the pollutant characteristics are listed in Table 1. Deionized (DI) water was used in all experiments and chemical solution preparation. The sol-gel method was applied with some modifications to synthesize the Co-TiO2 @SiO2 composite [40,41]. Firstly, 50 g of SiO2 was constantly mixed in a 250 mL NaOH 2 M for 2 h at a temperature of 150 degC. After the mixture cooled down, it was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman No. 42) to separate the undissolved SiO2 from the mixture. Then, 2.5 g of TiO2 and 2.5 g of CoCl2 were added to 50 mL of the filtrate solution, and it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed into an ultrasonic homogenizer at a frequency of 50 kHz for 60 min in order to get better particle dispersions. Dilute solution containing HCl 1 M was added dropwise into the mixture under constant stirring until the mixture turned into gels. The gels were left overnight for the compaction process. Subsequently, the spent solution was removed from the gels using a vacuum filter, and the damp gels were dried in an oven at 110 degC for 12 h. The dried gels were calcinated in a furnace at 500 degC for 5 h to remove the remaining organic substances and bonded water molecules, as well as for activating the photocatalysts. Then, it was crushed using a planetary ball mill machine, and the product was sieved to get finer powders. Similar steps were used in synthesizing TiO2 @SiO2 and Co-SiO2 composites. The composite membranes were fabricated by referring to the non-induced phase separation (NIPS) process [42]. Table 2 shows the variation of membrane compositions that were prepared in this study. In the beginning, a certain amount of PSf pellets were mixed into a 50 mL of NMP solvent until the PSf pellets wholly dissolved. Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife. Then, the casted solution was immersed in a DI water bath to form the membrane film, and it was left for 24 h to remove the spent solvent inside the membrane. Finally, membrane films were dried at an ambient condition.\n"

PSf (13.5w%), sPSf (4.5w%) and deionized water (1w%) were dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (99w%, Acros organics, Belgium) at 60 degC with 25w% polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw~1000 Da, Fluka, Belgium) as pore-forming agent (Zhao et al., 2020b, 2021). After degassing overnight, the solution was cast on a smooth glass plate with a wet thickness of 200 mm (measured from the valley point of the corrugation to the bottom of the polymer film, below referred to as base-layer) at a casting speed of 2.3 cm/s. Deionized water as non-solvent was sprayed on the cast film simultaneous with the move of the casting knife in order to rapidly initiate the phase inversion process and fix the patterns (Holda and Vankelecom, 2015; Marbelia et al., 2020). The cast film was immediately immersed into deionized water (20 degC) to complete the phase inversion (Holda and Vankelecom, 2015). Four different patterned membranes were referred to as Wave, Tri, Rec and Trap, respectively (Fig. 1). To investigate the effect of sPSf and s-NIPS on membrane performance and properties, three different non-patterned membranes were prepared with the same wet thickness using a conventional casting knife: (1) one prepared using the s-NIPS method and a casting solution with 13.5w% PSf, 4.5% sPSf (total polymer concentration of 18w%), 25w% PEG and 1w% deionized water; (2) one prepared using the conventional non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS, i.e. by directly immersing the cast film into the coagulation bath without any spraying) using a casting solution with 13.5w% PSf, 4.5% sPSf, 25w% PEG and 1w% deionized water; (3) one uncharged reference membrane prepared using the conventional NIPS method and a casting solution with 18w% PSf, 25w% PEG and 1w% deionized water. These three flat (F) membranes were referred as F-sNIPS, F-NIPS and F-PSf, respectively.\n",

Deionized water (DI water) was used throughout the experiment. PVDF flat sheet membranes (GVHP, Millipore, USA) were used as control samples. Firstly, 15 wt% PSf and 5 wt% PVP were dissolved in DMF to form the homogeneous casting solution with mechanical stirring for 12 h at 80 degC. The obtained solution was removed bubbles by storing at a constant temperature (80 degC) for at least 2 h. After degassing, the casting solution was poured onto a clean glass substrate with roughened surface, and was spread into a liquid membrane using a metal blade (200 mm). The primary membrane was immediately immersed in the first coagulation bath composed by mixed DI water and DMF in a volume ratio of 2 : 8 for 35 s, then immersed in the pure water bath for at least 30 min to completely finish the precipitation process. Afterwards, the membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h to remove residual solvent and then dried at room temperature for further use. The rough glass substrate was used in the present work for its effect to slow down the phase separation rate. If smooth glass was used, the coagulation bath could invade into the primary membrane from both top surface and bottom surface. For the rough glass case, the much closer interface joint between primary membrane and glass substrate will prevent the invasion of coagulation bath from the bottom surface. As a result, the prolonged phase separation period was helpful to create larger pores in bottom surface for the reason that the sufficient growth of polymer-rich phase and polymer-lean phase. Pristine PSf membranes with different pore structure sizes in bottom surface were also prepared and represented as PSf-PX.\n",

      "Paragraph: Polysulfone (PSF Mw ca. 80 k) was obtained from Shandong Horan Special Plastic (Weihai, China). Dichloromethane (DCM, 99.5%), chloroform (99.5%), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99.5%), ethyl alcohol (EtOH) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China). Chlorotrimethylsilane ((CH3)3SiCl), p-Toluene-sulfonyl azide (TsN3, 75% (EtOH) solution), copper (I) bromide (CuBr), propiolic acid, paraformaldehyde, tin (IV) chloride (SnCl4), trimethoxy-chlorosilane were applied by Aladdin Chemical (Shanghai, China). All reagents were used without further purification. The preparation of carboxyl polysulfone microspheres is shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSF) was synthesized by a mild reaction without chain scission (Scheme 1a). PSF (10.00 g, 22.5 mmol) was dissolved in 500 mL chloroform in a round bottom three-necked flask. Paraformaldehyde (13.40 g, 450 mmol), SnCl4 (0.54 mL, 4.5 mmol), and (CH3)3SiCl (57 mL, 450 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred under mechanical agitation for 12 h. At the end of this period, the solution was filtered with a sand core funnel to remove undissolved reactant, then precipitated in methanol and dried. The as-obtained product was named as chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSF). Secondly, as illustrated in Scheme 1b, CMPSF porous hollow microspheres were prepared via non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) methods. Typically, 1.00 g CMPSF and 0.80 g PEG1000 were dissolved in 50 mL NMP/DCM (1:5, vt %) mixed solvent and stirred for 30 min to obtain the precursor solution. Then, the precursor solution was slowly injected into the 500 mL coagulating bath (0.2% PVA aq). After the solvent dispersed in coagulation bath, a sustained stirring was applied at room temperature (25 degC) for 3 h. After washed with deionized water (DIW) and dried at 60 degC for 3 h, the obtained product was named as porous hollow chloromethylated polysulfone (PH-PSF) microspheres. Eventually, the PH-PSF microspheres were modified with TsN3 and propioic acid for further functionalization (Scheme 1c). The prepared PH-PSF microspheres were dispersed in 100 mL EtOH, and a suspension of PH-PSF was obtained with a concentration of 10 mg mL-1. Then, 0.50 g TsN3 was added into 100 mL PH-PSF/EtOH suspension and reacted for 6 h at 60 degC. Then, the product was washed three times with excess DIW and EtOH.

      "Paragraph: Polysulfone (PSf, Udel(r) P-3500, Solvay Comp) was dried at 120 degC under vacuum for 12 h. Sulfuryl chloride, N-butyllithium (2.5 M solution in hexane), piperazine (PIP, Reagent Plus), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) were purchased from sigma-aldrich. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried by calcium hydride for 24 h, and then was distilled and stored into SCHLENK under nitrogen. N-hexane, 2-methoxyethanol (EM), dimethyl formamide (DMF), hydrochloric acid (HCl), glycerol and NaOCl were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The preparation of SC-PSf referred to a previous literature as shown in (Fig. 1)[29]. Typically, PSf (6 g, 13.6 mmol) and 400 ml of THF were added into a four-necked round bottom flask, which was assembled by mechanical stirrer, argon inlet and thermometer. Subsequently, the PSf solution was cooled to -70 degC utilizing dry ice and acetone, and 2.1 equivalents (11.5 ml) of n-butyllithium was added into the flask at -70 degC. The solution was stirred for 1 h at -70 degC before 2.2 equivalents of sulfuryl chloride was added into the flask. Finally, 100 ml of deionized water was added into the solution for quenching active substances. The SC-PSf precipitate was obtained via pouring the polymer solution into i-propanol. The SC-PSf was washed by i-propanol for several times, and then was dried at 50 degC for 24 h under vacuum. Fig. 2 exhibits the hydrolysis of -SOCl2 SC-PSf (4 g) and 60 ml of THF were added into a flask, and the mixture was stirred by magnetic stirring until the solution was clear. Subsequently, 10 ml of deionized water was added into the solution at100 degC. The reaction hold for 2 h at100 degC. Thereafter, the solution was cooled to room temperature and was poured into i-propanol. The precipitate was collected and washed by i-propanol and deionized water for several times. Finally, the polymer was freeze-dried. The hydrolysis degree of SC-PSf could be adjusted by controlling the hydrolysed time. The obtained partially hydrolyzed polymer was labeled as SC(x)-S(y)-PSf, where x and y were the average numbers of sulfonyl chloride and sulphonic acid groups per repeating unit of prepared polymer, respectively. In order to calculate the amount of surplus SO2Cl groups, the THF solution of methylamine was utilized to react with SC-S-PSf (see Fig. 3). Concretely, 0.5 g of SC-S-PSf was dissolved into 10 ml of DMF, and then excessive methylamine was added into the solution. This reaction was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Subsequently, the polymer solution was slowly poured into 2 mol/L of HCl aqueous solution. Through a acidification of 24 h, the polymer was acquired by filtration, and then dialyzed by dialysis bag (MD34, MWCO 500 D) until the conductivity of dialyzate was lower than 10 ms. Finally, the polymer was dried at 80 degC under vacuum for 12 h. Thin film composite (TFC) was prepared by coating method as shown in Fig. 4. The PSf supporting layer was treated by 25% (v/v) glycerol aqueous solution before using. Then, SC-S-PSf and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) with various weight concentrations were dissolved in EM to form clear solution. The solution was filtrated by a 0.22 mm PTFE syringe filter before using. In a typical coating process, the solution was poured onto PSf supporting layer and then evenly shook for 2mins to ensure the uniformity of prepared membrane. Subsequently, the coated membrane was placed into an oven and dried at 60 degC for 4 min. This non-crosslinked membrane was recorded as Muc. After that, a PIP solution in n-hexane (the content of PIP was set at 5% of SC-S-PSf weight in solution) was poured onto membrane surface and kept for 3mins to react with SO2Cl group for preparing crosslinked membrane. Next, the membrane was dried in an oven at 60 degC for 5mins. This membrane crosslinked once was recorded as Mc-1. Repeating above operations twice, a denser membrane which was recorded as Mc-2 could be obtained.\n"

A glass plate was applied as the casting substrate to prepare the membranes. The synthesis of UV cured PSU based membranes was performed according to the scheme in Fig. 1. First, the casting solution was prepared, followed by membrane wet casting and finally UV irradiation to obtain a UV modified asymmetric PSU membrane. The detailed fabrication is described below. Asymmetric PSU based membranes were prepared via NIPS. A viscous solution containing 21wt% of PSU in DMF was stirred at 80degC for 3h. Subsequently, the solution was cooled down, and 5wt% of cross-linker, 3wt% of TPO, and THF (with a constant 85/15 DMF/THF ratio) were added and stirred. The compositions of the different casting solutions used are shown in Table 2. After obtaining a homogeneous solution, membranes with variable wet thicknesses of 50, 100, 150, or 200um were cast at a speed of 1.8mmin-1 using an automated casting knife (Braive Instruments, Belgium) [38]. Prior to an immersion into the coagulation bath containing deionized water, the membrane was exposed to air for 30s in order to evaporate the THF and thus create a thin selective layer at the surface of the film. During the casting, the air temperature was 20+-3degC, while the relative humidity was 40+-10%. The PSU membrane cross-linking was performed via UV curing. The UV curable membrane samples were transported through a UV curing unit (Fusion Systems, Inc., USA) at a line speed of 10mmin-1, which was equipped with a D-bulb located above the conveyor belt. The main irradiation light was UVA (320-390nm). The final dose of energy to cure the membranes was 12.3Jcm-2.\n"

Methyl orange (MO) (Mw = 327.3 Da), Acid fuchsin (AF) (Mw = 585.0 Da), Congo red (CR) (Mw = 696.7 Da), Coomassie brilliant blue (BBR) (Mw = 825.5 Da) and Evans blue (EB) (Mw = 960.8 Da) were used as model dyes in this study. Details of the model dyes are listed in Table S1. The composition of the polymer solution was presented in Table 1. The polymer concentration was 28 wt%. The additive (H2O) was added at 7 wt%, which calculated using an external method and obtained from our previous work [18]. As shown in Table 1, a certain amount of PES, SPSf and water were dissolved in DMAc to obtain a homogeneous polymer solution under continuous stirring at 70 +- 1 degC for 12 h. After deaeration, the polymer solution was cast onto a clean glass plate with a steel knife set at 300 mm film thickness and a relative humidity of 40 +- 1%, and then immersed in the water bath (25 +- 1 degC). The resultant membrane (M4) was washed with pure water, and kept in pure water.

      "Paragraph: A sequence spectra of ultrasonic wave pulses obtained from PES/DMAc polymer solution during the phase inversion process were described in Fig. S2. The ultrasonic signal time-shifting in time-domain obtained from the PES/DMAc and SPSf/DMAc casting solution during the phase inversion process correlated to the formation rate of membrane as illustrated in Fig. 4. The polymer concentration in the two kinds of casting solutions kept at the same (28 wt %). Time-shifting is described as the time differential between the initial immersion time of the polymer solution and a particular time during membrane formation. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that the ultrasonic signals time-shifting of PES/DMAc casting solution raised sharply at the initial time of 30 s, then progressively attained a steady value at 93 ns after 50 s in the membrane formation process. The quick ultrasonic signal time-shifting was related to the rapid diffusional exchange between water and DMAc. Obviously, the ultrasonic signal time-shifting decelerated for the SPSf/DMAc casting solution, which exhibited a steady value of 37 ns after 50 s. It demonstrated that the diffusional exchange rate achieved from SPSf/DMAc casting solution was slower than that obtained from PES/DMAc casting solution, which displayed a slower phase inversion rate. The ultrasonic measurements are in good consistence with the ternary phase diagram analysis and membrane formation mechanism.\n",

Potassium permanganate (KMnO4,99 %), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95 %), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, >= 95 %), toluene (>= 99.5 %) were procured from Fisher Scientific. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 %), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35-38%), phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 99 %), and, hexane (>= 98.5 %) were procured from BDH. Dodecylamine (DDA, > 97 %), polysulfone pellets (PSF, Mw ~ 35,000), Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, >= 96 %, Mw ~ 66 kDa), N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc, >= 99 %), 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, 99.5 %), ethanol (>= 99.8 %), and humic acid (HA) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, >= 99.8 %) and dodecane (>= 99 %) were purchased from Honeywell. All chemicals were used as purchased without further purification. GO nanoparticles were synthesized via a modified Hummers method that was previously reported [43]. In brief, a mixture of 24 mL of H2SO4 and 6 mL of H3PO4 was stirred in an ice bath for several minutes. 1 g of Gr flakes and 3 g of KMnO4 were then added into mixing solution under the same conditions. The reactants were then stirred at 95 +- 2 degC in an oil bath for 30 min followed by the addition of 50 mL deionized water (DI) and stirring for another 30 min at the same conditions. The reaction was then terminated by adding DI (150 mL) and H2O2 (20 mL). The mixture was then diluted with HCl (20 %) and centrifuged, followed by several washing/centrifugation cycles with DI until obtaining a neutral pH. GO nanoparticles were then obtained by drying the samples overnight at 80 degC. The dried GO nanoparticles were then aminated with DDA using the temperature-assisted solution interaction technique [23]. In brief, 100 mg of GO were dispersed in DI (50 mL) and 300 mg of DDA were dispersed in ethanol (50 mL) and both solutions were then ultrasonicated for 1 h. Both GO and DDA suspensions were mixed in a round bottom flask and stirred in an oil bath (60 degC, 48 h) under the reflux conditions. The aminated GO (rGO-DDA) nanoparticles were then obtained by the solvent evaporation technique followed by several washings with ethanol followed by vacuum drying at 85 degC overnight. A schematic representation of the GO synthesis, the amination reaction with DDA and the anticipated structure of rGO-DDA is presented in Fig. 1. Bare PSF, PSF/GO and PSF/rGO-DDA mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared using the well-known non-solvent induced phase separation method [44]. In brief, PSF (17 wt.%) in NMP was used as the main casting solution with 3 wt.% PVP as the pore former. For the preparation of PSF/GO and PSF/rGO-DDA casting solutions, two stock dispersions (0.5 mg/mL) of the pristine GO and rGO-DDA in NMP were prepared and sonicated for 2 h. Different loadings of GO and rGO-DDA were then added to NMP according to Table 1. PSF and PVP were then slowly added to the dispersions and stirred vigorously for 2 h followed by slow stirring overnight until homogenous solutions were obtained (Figure S1 in the supplementary information). The obtained solutions were then casted on a clean glass plate at a uniform speed using an automated casting machine equipped with a film applicator (Elcometer (r), UK). The casted solutions were then soaked into a coagulant bath (DI) where the phase inversion took place and the membrane detached freely from the glass plate. The obtained membranes were then washed and kept in DI for until testing. Fig. 2 illustrates the phase inversion technique for the fabrication of membranes studied in this work. The compositions and codes of the prepared membranes are presented in Table 1.\n"

      "Paragraph: Polysulfone (PSF, Solvay P3500 LCD) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3, Aladdin) were dried overnight in vacuum oven prior to use. Bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone (DCDPS, 98%, Aladdin) was recrystallized twice from hot toluene (DCDPS: toluene = 1:1.1 (weight ratio)) prior to use. Bisphenol-A (BPA, 99%, Aladdin) was recrystallized twice from hot toluene (BPA: toluene = 1:5.3 (weight ratio)). And the crystals were dried in vacuum oven at 125 degC all day. S-1-dodecyl-S'-(a,a'-dimethyl-a''-acetic acid) trithiocarbonate (DDMAT) was synthesized according to the literature (Lai et al., 2002). 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), dichloromethane (DCM), 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP), 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), toluene, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, >99.5%), palladium(II) chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, potassium hexachloroplatinate, copper(II) chloride and nickel (II) chloride were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). 4-vinylpyridine was distilled under reduced pressure or passed through basic alumina column to remove the inhibitor before being used, and AIBN was recrystallized from ethanol. Dihydroxy-terminated polysulfone (HO-PSF-OH) was prepared in a typical process that via nucleophilic condensation reaction between DCDPS and BPA based on the reported literatures (Xie et al., 2016). The synthesis is briefly summed up as follows: DCDPS (43.8 mmol), BPA (42.5 mmol) and K2CO3 (13.2 mmol) were dissolved into a NMP and toluene mixed solution (v/v = 3/1) of 60 mL, which was placed in a three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a Dean-Stark trap, a condenser, a gas inlet/outlet and a mechanical stirrer. After 30 min nitrogen charging, the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, and then gradually heated to 152 degC for 8 h under reflux. The water produced by the reaction was removed completely by azeotropic distillation with toluene. Then, the reaction mixture was heated to 175 degC, and started the polymerization for 8 h. After that, the reaction was exposed to air for stopping the reaction, and then cooled to room temperature. The reacted mixture was precipitated into a HCl/methanol aqueous solution (v/v = 2/1) with fully stirring, and then filtrated. Further, the obtained polymer was dissolved in THF, and subsequently re-precipitated into the HCl/methanol aqueous solution for three times. After filtration, the polymer was washed with water at 80 degC for 4 h. Finally, it was dried in a vacuum oven at 90 degC for 24 h to obtain the HO-PSF-OH. HO-PSF-OH (0.625 mmol), DDMAT (1.92 mmol), DMAP (0.18 mmol) and DCM (75 mL) were added into a 150 mL round bottom flask equipped with a condenser, a magnetic stirrer and a gas inlet/outlet. After purging with nitrogen for 3 h at 0 degC, DCC (1.92 mmol), which was dispersed in a small amount of DCM, was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. Then, the reaction mixture was raised to room temperature and started reaction for 72 h under stirring. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst DMAP and the dicyclohexylurea (from DCC), and concentrated by the rotary evaporation. Then, the mixture was precipitated into methanol and filtered. Further, the obtained polymer was dissolved in DCM and re-precipitated to methanol for three times. After filtration, the polymer was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 degC for 24 h to obtain the DDMAT-terminated polysulfone (DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT), and used as the macromolecular chain transfer agent. A dry Schlenk flask equipped with magnetic stirrer was charged with AIBN (0.02 mmol), DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT (0.1 mmol), 4-VP (40 mmol) and DMAc (10 mL). The Schlenk flask was degassed with three times of freeze-pump-thaw cycles, sealed off under nitrogencondition. The RAFT polymerization was performed in an oil bath at 80 degC for 24 h. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, it was precipitated into deionized water. The filtered polymer was re-dissolved to DMAc and re-precipitated into deionized water for twice. Finally, the polymer was washed with methanol, and then dried at 60 degC for 24 h to obtain the amphiphilic triblock copolymer poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-polysulfone-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP-PSF-P4VP) according to the mole ratio of [AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:2000. The polymers according to other two ratios ([AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:500/1000) were also synthesized in the same steps. The P4VP-PSF-P4VPs synthesized with [AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:500/1000/2000 were named as BCP1, BCP2 and BCP3, respectively, and their synthesis condition and characteristics are listed in Table 1. P4VP-PSF-P4VP/PSF blend membranes were prepared via the SNIPS process, and the schematic illustration for SNIPS process and the surface-segregation of P4VP-PSF-P4VP are shown in Scheme 1. The hydrophilic segment P4VP was segregated gradually towards the membrane surface and pore walls due to the interaction between water and the hydrophilic segment as the contact time increased in the coagulation bath. At the same time, the P4VP-PSF-PSF self-assembled in the bulk and the solvent. According to the ratio set in the Table 2, the casting solutions were prepared by blending polysulfone and P4VP-PSF-P4VP, which were dissolved in DMAc under mechanical stirring at room temperature for 24 h. In order to remove the bubbles, the casting solutions were stood at room temperature for 24 h until the bubbles were exhausted. All casting solutions were cast uniformly in a clean glass plate by a cast knife with a knife gap of 250 mm, and then immediately immersed into the deionized water at room temperature. The obtained membranes were transferred into a new deionized water bath for 24 h to complete the phase inversion and remove the residual solvent. The as-prepared membranes were stored in deionized water bath before use.\n"

In the slot die casting method, the slot gap is set at 90 mm, and the coating gap is set at 200 mm above the glass plate substrate, which is placed on top of the poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film. The PET film is the moving conveyor that is pulled at a speed of 1.3 mm/s from a feed roller to the take-up roller [30]. A syringe pump is used to set the flow rate of the dope solution dispensed from the slot die to fabricate defect free membranes. For each batch, approximately 80 mL of dope solution is filled in the syringe. A different 2D flow rate is used for each dope solution, for PSf/DMAc, 0.17 mm2/s is used; for PSf/PolarClean, 0.75 mm2/s is used, and 0.70 mm2/s is used for PSf/50%PolarClean-50%GVL. The different 2D flow rates are used due to the different properties of these dope solutions. All casting is performed at 25 degC and 48% humidity. The glass substrates are cleaned with DI water and are then rinsed using isopropyl alcohol to guarantee no residual water on the surface before casting. After casting, the liquid films are inversed into a solid film via the NIPS method. Membranes pieces are then cast in the shape of 305 x 100 mm x mm (length x width).\n",

      "Paragraph: Polysulfone (PSf) with Mw-35000 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Mw-400 were obtained from Solvay and Aladdin, respectively. N, N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.8%) were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Company. Cuprous iodide (CuI) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) were purchased from Sinooharm Chemical Reagent Co. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used as the only component of the nonsolvent in the coagulation bath and for all the aqueous solutions. The synthesis of CuI superstructure nanosheets followed a process similar to our previous report [26]. Commercial CuI powder was first dissolved in acetonitrile by ultrasonication until transparent solution was formed with a concentration of 20 g/L (CuI-acetonitrile adducts solution). Subsequently, 30 mL of PVP aqueous solution (30 g/L) was injected into 10 mL of CuI-acetonitrile adducts solution through a syringe under vigorous magnetic stirring (800 rpm). After stirring for 1 h, the gradually formed white precipitates were collected by the removal of supernatant, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at room temperature. Asymmetric PSf/CuI superstructure nanosheets membranes were prepared by the NIPS process. For preparing the casting solution, PSf (16 wt%) and PEG (8 wt%) were first dissolved in DMAc (76 wt%) by vigorously stirring at 300 rpm for 12 h under 70 degC. Then different amounts of the prepared CuI superstructure nanosheets (0, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 wt% based on the overall mass of the casting solution) were added into the polymer solution and mechanically stirred for 2 h to form a homogeneous solution. Finally, the solution was degassed under vacuum at 50 degC for 2 h. The resultant solution was cast onto a nonwoven fabric with a casting knife to obtain a casting film. Then the supported film was coagulated in deionized water at room temperature. The solidified PSf/CuI superstructure nanosheets membranes were thoroughly washed with water to remove the residual DMAc. The prepared MMMs with different loading contents of the CuI superstructure nanosheets (0, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 wt% based on the casting solution) are denoted as PSf, PSf/s-CuI 0.5%, PSf/s-CuI 0.8% and PSf/s-CuI 1.0%, respectively. In addition, we annealed CuI superstructure nanosheets in air in a muffle furnace for 1 h at 280 degC and 350 degC, respectively, for partly and completely converting CuI to CuO. The resulting products were also used as fillers (0.8 wt% based on the casting solution) for preparing the MMMs according to the same method mentioned above. These two samples are denoted as PSf/s-CuI-280 0.8% and PSf/s-CuI-350 0.8%, respectively.\n"

The pristine detonation ND nanoparticles with a phase purity higher than 95% were procured from Nabond technology Co., Ltd., China. The average diameter and specific surface area of ND nanoparticles were about 5 nm and 282.8 m2 g-1, respectively. Vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTS) with the purity of 97% from Merck was used for silane functionalization of ND nanoparticles. The following materials were used with no other purification: ethanol (99.8%, Sigma), acetone (99%, Merck) and acetic acid (99.85%, Sigma). Influent wastewater and adapted activated sludge were supplied by the wastewater treatment plat of Dana pharmaceutical company, Iran, and used as MBR feed. At first, carboxylation of NDs was carried out by thermal oxidation, 0.6 g of ND nanoparticles were thermally oxidized at 425 degC for 4 h. Carboxylated ND (ND-COOH) was then reacted with hydrolyzed VTS by esterification method leading to SND nanoparticles [31]. The silanization process was performed by preparing 80 ml solution of distilled water/ethanol (20:80 v/v) and its pH was adjusted to 3.5-4.5 by adding acetic acid. The desired amount of VTS was then added to the solution followed by stirring at ambient temperature for 30 min which leads to hydrolysis of the silane. According to the literature, the best weight ratio of (VTS/ND-COOH, w/w) is 5:1; so 0.3 g of ND-COOH was then added to the solution and dispersed by ultrasonic bath (120 W, 28 kHz) for an hour. Then, it was stirred at 65 degC for 4 h. Afterwards, the suspension was placed in an oven at 120 degC for 4 h.

      "Paragraph: A series of allyl polysulfone-graft-poly(dopamine methacrylamide) membranes (AP-DM# membranes, where # is the weight ratio of DMA to APSf) were prepared by an in situ process composed of grafting-through polymerization followed by a non-solvent induced phase separation method [28,29]. For the preparation of AP-DM1 membrane, APSf (1.00 g), AIBN (0.10 g), PSf (1.00 g), and DMA (1.00 g) were dissolved in 10.3 mL of NMP in a 100 mL dried Schlenk flask containing a magnetic stir bar. PSf is the commercial polysulfone, and it was intentionally used to increase the stability of the membrane. The flask was sealed with a septum and deoxygenated with nitrogen for 1 h. The flask was then placed in an 80 degC oil bath, and stirred with a magnetic stir bar for 6 h for the polymerization of the vinyl groups in APSf and DMA resulting in a clear brown solution. After the polymerization, the resulting solution was left in sonication at degassing mode for 2 h to remove the air bubbles trapped within the solution, followed by casting on a non-woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric using a doctor blade at a thickness of 200 mm, and then immersed into DI water bath at room temperature. After 24 h, the resulting membrane was rinsed thoroughly for 24 h with 0.25 M of NaOH solution to remove the solvent and any remaining DMA and poly(dopamine methacrylamide) (PDMA) produced by homo-polymerization. The resulting membrane was designated as AP-DM1 membrane, where the number 1 indicates the weight ratio of DMA to APSf. Other AP-DM# membranes such as AP-DM0.6 and AP-DM0.8 membranes were prepared using the same procedure except the amount of DMA as listed in Table 1. An antimicrobial peptide, nisin, was immobilized onto the surface of AP-DM# membranes by the reaction between N-terminal NH2 group of nisin and catechol group of DMA moiety in the membrane. 1.0 and 5.0 g/L of nisin solutions were prepared using 40 and 200 g of nisin powder, respectively, and 1L of phosphate buffer solutions with pH value of 7.4 [20]. Since the content of active ingredient in nisin is about 2.5%, 40 and 200 g of nisin powder were used to prepare the 1.0 and 5.0 g/L solutions, respectively, and any insoluble components in the solutions were removed by vacuum filtration. In order to immobilize the nisin, the AP-DM# membranes were immersed in the nisin solution for 6 h at room temperature, and then they were rinsed with the phosphate buffer. The rinsed membranes were finally immersed in DI water bath at room temperature for 24 h, and then stored in DI water in the refrigerator. The membranes were named as AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes, in accordance with the concentrations of nisin active ingredient of 1.0 and 5.0 g/L, respectively (Table 1). The content of nisin in the AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes was estimated by calculating the bonding density using Eq. (1), as follows:(1)Bondingdensity(%)=Wmemb,t-Wmemb,t0Amembx100\n"

      "Paragraph: Polysulfone (PSf, S6010) was bought from BASF SE. Vinyltriethoxysilane (VTEOS), N-vinyl pyrrolidone (VP), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (Lyz) were purchased from Aladdin, China. VTEOS and VP were purified with basic alumina and activated carbon before use, respectively. AIBN was recrystallized from ethanol. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were supplied by the Blood Center of Ningbo, China. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), Prothrombin time (PT) and The content of fibrinogen (FIB) transferring to fibrin reagent kits were purchased from Shanghai Sun Biotech Co., Ltd., China. All other regents, such as N,N'-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and ethanol, were brought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. The PSf membranes were prepared via the in situ cross-linked polymerization and the classical non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique. In a typical procedure, PSf (16g), VP, VTEOS and AIBN (2mol% with respect to VP and VTEOS) were dissolved in DMAc under mechanical stirring and N2 protection to get a transparent reaction solution. The total weigh of the reaction solution was 99g, and the malar ration of VP to VTEOS was locked at 2.5. Then the polymerization was carried out at 80degC for 12h with stirring and N2 atmosphere, and stopped by quenching in ice water. Subsequently, acetic acid solution (1mL) was added into the obtained solution under stirring for 2h to improve the hydrolysis of the ethoxysilyl groups (SiOC2H5) and subsequent condensation of the silanol groups (SiOH). After being vacuum degassed, the casting solution was spread onto a glass plate and immersed into a water bath at 30degC for liquid-liquid phase separation. Then the solid membrane was immersed in distilled water at 80degC for 24h to thoroughly remove unreacted monomers and solvent, and further improve the cross-linking polymerization. The fabricated PSf microporous membranes with a thickness of 68+-5mm were dried via freeze drying and designated as M0, M1.5, M3, M4.5, M6 and M7, respectively. The numbers denoted the corresponding weight percentages of monomers of VP and VTEOS in the casting solution. The in situ cross-linked polymerization of VP and VTEOS in PSf solution was presented in Scheme 1.\n",

Polysulfone (PSF, S6010) was purchased from Dongguan Haosheng Plastic Material Company and dried under vacuum at 60 degC for 12 h before use. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, >98%)) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM, Analytical Grade) were purchased from Aladdin, Shanghai. Zn (NO3) 2*6H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Congo Red (CR), Methyl Orange (MO) and Methylene Blue (MBe) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai) Reagent Company, Shanghai Maclean Biochemical Technology Company and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent company respectively. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWF were cut into 16cm x 16 cm piece and then were poured and completely wet by a 30 g/L Zn (NO3) 2*6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF were then dried in oven at 30 degC for 0.5 h before use. The fully de-foamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 mm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters of 14cm x 14 cm, and then immersed into a 50 degC de-ionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30 degC in an oven for 40 min and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 18 g of polysulfone (PSF), 6 g of ZIF-8 particles, and 2 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), with a total mass of 100 g. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50 degC (200 rpm), a casting suspension was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The fully de-foamed suspension was then cast onto the pristine PET NWF at a thickness of 250 mm using a coating machine.

PAA concentrations in the coagulation bath and corresponding membrane abbreviations are presented in Table 2. Membranes were kept in distilled water at least for 24 h to remove the residual solvent. The time of membrane formation in NIPS was determined as the time from the moment of immersion of a nascent polymer film into the coagulation bath to the moment, when the precipitated membrane completely separates from the glass plate.
