       "                  The non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process applied to polysulfone (PSf) casting solutions traditionally leads to the formation of membranes decorated with large macrovoids in their cross-section on top of which lies a dense skin offering a significant resistance to flow. Macrovoids, are considered weak points. They are prone to compaction leading to poor filtration performance over time. Here, we used 2-pyrrolidone (2P) to prepare skin-free PSf membranes by NIPS, and studied the effect of water as an additive to help suppress the formation of macrovoids. The surface images showed the presence of multiple pores while the cross-section images exhibited the successful suppression of macrovoids. The latter was attributed to the enhancement of the solution viscosity causing the mass transfer kinetics to be slowed down, consequently affecting the demixing rates. Moreover, the rheological behavior of the casting solutions revealed that high degree of chain entanglement helped mitigate macrovoid formation. Using 2P as the solvent for PSf permitted the retention of interconnected pores from the top surface, due to the high viscosity of the solution which prevented coarsening. The high porosity (&gt;75%) and large pores (&gt;0.3 μm) of the PSf membranes were still maintained. The permeability of membranes was maintained after suppressing the macrovoids but their mechanical attributes were improved. The feasibility of utilizing water to eliminate macrovoid growth was further validated when applied to other PSf/solvent systems which showed similar trends in the SEM images. These results imply that water as a casting solution additive can provide a highly cost-effective and simple strategy to obtain macrovoid-free p olysulfone membranes.\n",

       "<ce:simple-para id=\"abspara0010\" view=\"all\">The non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process applied to polysulfone (PSf) casting solutions traditionally leads to the formation of membranes decorated with large macrovoids in their cross-section on top of which lies a dense skin offering a significant resistance to flow. Macrovoids, are considered weak points. They are prone to compaction leading to poor filtration performance over time. Here, we used 2-pyrrolidone (2P) to prepare skin-free PSf membranes by NIPS, and studied the effect of water as an additive to help suppress the formation of macrovoids. The surface images showed the presence of multiple pores while the cross-section images exhibited the successful suppression of macrovoids. The latter was attributed to the enhancement of the solution viscosity causing the mass transfer kinetics to be slowed down, consequently affecting the demixing rates. Moreover, the rheological behavior of the casting solutions revealed that high degree of chain entanglement helped mitigate macrovoid formation. Using 2P as the solvent for PSf permitted the retention of interconnected pores from the top surface, due to the high viscosity of the solution which prevented coarsening. The high porosity (&gt;75%) and large pores (&gt;0.3 μm) of the PSf membranes were still maintained. The permeability of membranes was maintained after suppressing the macrovoids but their mechanical attributes were improved. The feasibility of utilizing water to eliminate macrovoid growth was further validated when applied to other PSf/solvent systems which showed similar trends in the SEM images. These results imply that water as a casting solution additive can provide a highly cost-effective and simple strategy to obtain macrovoid-free p olysulfone membranes.</ce:simple-para>\n",

Due to these, NIPS process has been regarded as the most widely-used approach in fabricating flat sheet membranes from a variety of polymers [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0075\" refid=\"bib4\">4</ce:cross-ref>]. In addition, NIPS can provide a wide-range of pore size: from microfiltration to nanofiltration [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0080\" refid=\"bib5\">5</ce:cross-ref>]. In this process, a polymer of choice is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Once homogeneous, the polymeric solution is cast onto a support and phase-inversion is prompted through direct immersion in a coagulation bath/non-solvent bath (typically water), generating a polymer rich phase that transforms into the membrane matrix after polymer precipitation, and a polymer lean phase which develops into pores after demixing [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0085\" refid=\"bib6\">6</ce:cross-ref>].</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0040\" view=\"all\">Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is amongst the most extensively used commercial membranes due to its favorable attributes such as high glass transition temperature (T<ce:inf loc=\"post\">g</ce:inf> = 190 °C), high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance over a wide-range of pH, good thermal resistance, exceptional biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0015\" refid=\"bib7 bib8 bib9\">7–9</ce:cross-refs>]. PSf membranes are commonly used in wastewater treatment [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0020\" refid=\"bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14\">10–14</ce:cross-refs>], hemodialysis [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0025\" refid=\"bib15 bib16 bib17\">15–17</ce:cross-refs>], protein purification [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0030\" refid=\"bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22\">18–22</ce:cross-refs>], food processing [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0090\" refid=\"bib23\">23</ce:cross-ref>], and so on. Polar solvents like <ce:italic>N</ce:italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0095\" refid=\"bib1\">1</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0035\" refid=\"bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27\">24–27</ce:cross-refs>], <ce:italic>N,N</ce:italic>-dimethylformamide (DMF) [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0100\" refid=\"bib9\">9</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0040\" refid=\"bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31\">28–31</ce:cross-refs>], and <ce:italic>N,N</ce:italic>-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0045\" refid=\"bib32 bib33 bib34 bib35\">32–35</ce:cross-refs>] are usually used to dissolved PSf polymers. Utilizing these solvents to prepare PSf membranes via NIPS process generally leads to formation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with relatively dense surface structure and porous sub-structure. Meanwhile, the cross-section of these membranes is composed of large macrovoids with walls having cellular-like structure [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0105\" refid=\"bib36\">36</ce:cross-ref>] which could generate low flux due to the closed-pore structure (the pores are not interconnected with each other) that could potentially slow down the flow of water across the membrane. Additionally, concerns have been expressed on the use of such solvents to prepare polymeric membranes due to their toxicity which can cause adverse effects to our health. Besides, during NIPS process, these solvents are released into the coagulation bath during the membrane formation, and residual solvents are further extracted in the washing bath. These constitute to the release of 20–50 billion liters of contaminated water annually [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0110\" refid=\"bib1\">1</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0115\" refid=\"bib37\">37</ce:cross-ref>], and if not properly treated, can create immense damages to the environment. Hence, the use of these solvents in industries are now strictly regulated. In May 2020, the European Union has imposed a mandate on the use of NMP which has led researchers to find “greener” and more sustainable solvents [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0120\" refid=\"bib24\">24</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0125\" refid=\"bib37\">37</ce:cross-ref>] that have high affinity towards the PSf polymer.

       "<ce:para id=\"p0045\" view=\"all\">As a result of the raising interest to improve the sustainability of PSf membrane production, several different solvents have been investigated in the past with respect to their suitability for replacing harmful solvents. In recent studies conducted by Kahrs and Schwellenbach [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0130\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>], Wang et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0135\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0140\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>], Mousavi and Zadhoush [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0145\" refid=\"bib41\">41</ce:cross-ref>], and Mousavi et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0150\" refid=\"bib42\">42</ce:cross-ref>] the use of utilizing 2-pyrrolidone (2P) solvent as a substitute for NMP was explored. 2P is an organic compound derived from γ-butyrolactone with considerable similarities with NMP as shown in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0155\" refid=\"tbl1\">Table 1</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"tbl1\"/>. To date, there are no known life-threatening risks accompanied by using 2P, making it a potential alternative for NMP.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0050\" view=\"all\">Standard NIPS process yield skinned asymmetric membranes with large macrovoids that could either have closed pore (cellular) structure or interconnected open pore (bi-continuous structure) [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0160\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0165\" refid=\"bib43\">43</ce:cross-ref>]. Macrovoids are defects that grow perpendicular or near perpendicular to the skin or top layer [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0170\" refid=\"bib44\">44</ce:cross-ref>]. They are large in size, and have elongated or teardrop-shaped pores ranging from 10 to 50 μm [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0175\" refid=\"bib45\">45</ce:cross-ref>]. The presence of these large macrovoids can weaken the structural integrity of the membranes which can lead to breakage and total failure during operation [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0180\" refid=\"bib46\">46</ce:cross-ref>]. Since the first development of phase-inversion process by Leob and Sourirajan in the 1960's [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0185\" refid=\"bib47\">47</ce:cross-ref>], macrovoid formation have confounded researchers which has led to the development of different studies to understand macrovoid formation [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0190\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0195\" refid=\"bib44\">44</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0200\" refid=\"bib48\">48</ce:cross-ref>]. Numerous models were proposed for the formation of macrovoids. Early on, Reuvers and Smolders suggested that macrovoids were formed as the result of the nucleation of the polymer poor phase [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0205\" refid=\"bib49\">49</ce:cross-ref>]. Strathmann et al. explained that the macrovoid was initiated by the rupture of the polymeric skin caused by shrinkage stress-induced-syneresis [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0210\" refid=\"bib50\">50</ce:cross-ref>]. Other researchers considered that macrovoid formation stemmed from the thermodynamics aspects of chemical potential gradient [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0215\" refid=\"bib43\">43</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0050\" refid=\"bib51 bib52 bib53\">51–53</ce:cross-refs>]. Additional theories include Marangoni effects [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0220\" refid=\"bib54\">54</ce:cross-ref>], solutocapillary convection mechanism [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0055\" refid=\"bib55 bib56 bib57\">55–57</ce:cross-refs>], osmotic pressure [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0225\" refid=\"bib58\">58</ce:cross-ref>] and combination of different mechanisms [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0230\" refid=\"bib59\">59</ce:cross-ref>]. Nonetheless, several methods have been investigated to reduce macrovoid formation during immersion precipitation due to their weak mechanical strength. These include (i) choosing a solvent and non-solvent pair with low affinity towards each other; (ii) increasing the viscosity of the casting solution by increasing the polymer concentration or adding additives; and (iii) adding solvent to the coagulation bath [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0235\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0240\" refid=\"bib43\">43</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0060\" refid=\"bib60 bib61 bib62\">60–62</ce:cross-refs>].</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0055\" view=\"all\">Although adding solvent to the coagulation bath seem to be the easiest option however, this could lead to increased production costs and pollution. The addition of additives has been the most explored strategies to mitigate the growth of macrovoids, and adding amounts of hydrophilic polymers such polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most predominant [<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0065\" refid=\"bib63 bib64 bib65\">63–65</ce:cross-refs>]. Some studies revealed that the addition of these hydrophilic polymers can enlarge the size of the macrovoids, while other studies reported the opposite as highlighted in the study by Sadrzadeh and Bhattacharjee [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0245\" refid=\"bib64\">64</ce:cross-ref>]. These inconsistencies could be due to the fact that PVP and PEG are originally utilized as pore formers for polymeric membranes. They form pores as they leach out of the cast film upon immersion in the coagulation bath. However, depending on the molecular weights of the PVP and PEG [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0250\" refid=\"bib64\">64</ce:cross-ref>], some can get trapped in the polymeric matrix. Therefore, the molecular weights of these materials have to be taken into great considerations before being used to suppress macrovoids. On the other hand, other researchers have used non-solvents such as water [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0255\" refid=\"bib24\">24</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0260\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0265\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0270\" refid=\"bib66\">66</ce:cross-ref>], ethanol [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0275\" refid=\"bib65\">65</ce:cross-ref>] and other organic solvents [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0280\" refid=\"bib66\">66</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0285\" refid=\"bib67\">67</ce:cross-ref>] to control the exchange rates of the solvent and coagulant. Among these, water appear to be the most logical option due to its accessibility, abundancy, low-cost, and non-toxicity.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0060\" view=\"all\">As of this writing, there are only 4 published works on PSf/2P system. Mousavi and colleagues intensively worked on the dynamics of using 2P as a sole solvent for PSf, and a co-solvent, and how the rheology of these conditions contributed to the resulting cross-section structure of PSf membranes [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0290\" refid=\"bib41\">41</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0295\" refid=\"bib42\">42</ce:cross-ref>]. Since standard NIPS process produce ultrafiltration PSf membrane, Wang et al. in their earlier work [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0300\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>], explored the use of vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process to obtain PSf membranes with highly porous surface and cross-section. Recently, Wang and colleagues observed the macrovoid initiation position in PSf/2P system prepared by NIPS process [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0305\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>]. These previous works have provided initial understanding on the solvency of PSf in 2P, and on how the viscoelasticity of the casting solution affects the cross-section of PSf membranes. It is important to note that, except for the work on PSf/2P using VIPS process, the other studies only focused on the morphology of the cross-section of PSf membranes, specifically on the growth of macrovoids.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0065\" view=\"all\">This study encompasses two major objectives: (i) fabrication of highly porous PSf membranes through NIPS process using 2P as the solvent, and (ii) the suppression of macrovoid growth by using water as a non-solvent additive in the PSf/2P casting solution. Although, other studies [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0310\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0315\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>] have previously explored the feasibility of this concept, they have not fully determined the amount of water that can be added to achieve macrovoid-free PSf membranes. Moreover, in this study, in-depth evaluations of the physical properties such morphology, porosity, pore size, permeability, and mechanical property of the PSf membranes with respect to the concentration of the additive are thoroughly carried out. <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0320\" refid=\"fig1\">Fig. 1</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig1\"/> shows the three major parts of this study. The first part, heavily revolves on trying to understand how the nature of solvency of 2P affects the morphology of the PSf membranes, and its viability as a replacement for NMP solvent. Next, once the fundamental concepts of 2P/PSf system are established, the use of water as an additive in the casting solution to suppress macrovoids is examined. Herein, we shall probe into the viscosity of the solution, study the ternary diagram, and investigate the kinetics that took place during phase-inversion. In addition, comprehensive analysis of the physical properties of the membranes such as porosity, pore size, morphology, permeability, and mechanical properties will be examined. Lastly, the potential application of this concept will also be extended to other systems such as PSf/NMP, PSf/DMAc, and PSf/DMF to test the practicality of using water to suppress macrovoids.</ce:para>\n",

As shown in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0425\" refid=\"tbl2\">Tables 2</ce:cross-ref> and 2P is a poorer solvent than NMP therefore, the homogeneous region of PSf/2P/water phase diagram is narrower than PSf/NMP/water. This indicates that it would take less amount of non-solvent (water) to induce demixing in PSf/2P system. The cloud points in <ce:cross-ref id=\"opttY2c98rcbu\" refid=\"fig2\">Fig. 2</ce:cross-ref> denoted the amount of water needed to demix the system. For PSf/2P system, it takes about 2 wt% of water to phase separate the solution, and as the amount of PSf in the solution is increased, it takes a lesser amount of non-solvent to induce phase-inversion. With this knowledge, we can identify how much non-solvent additive we can add into the casting solution without causing phase-inversion. Another key parameter that must be considered is the relative energy difference (RED) which provides information on whether the parameters of the two molecules (usually a polymer and solvent) are within range. This can be measured according to the following equations [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0430\" refid=\"bib2\">2</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0435\" refid=\"bib77\">77</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0440\" refid=\"bib78\">78</ce:cross-ref>]:<ce:display>\n",

Left-hand figure displays the surface and cross-section morphology of the PSf membrane when NMP was used as a solvent, while the right-hand figure represents the PSf/2P system. Starting with the PSf/NMP system, a dense surface structure was obtained which is consistent with other published works [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0455\" refid=\"bib1\">1</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0070\" refid=\"bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27\">24–27</ce:cross-refs>] while, a skinned asymmetric membrane with large finger-like macrovoids extending from the top part to the bottom part of the membranes with walls having cellular-like structure was obtained.

Meanwhile, it appears that the macrovoids were found at the deeper part of the membrane. Zoomed-in images of the membrane reveal that instead of cellular-like structure, 2P solvent generated interconnected pores or bi-continuous structure which is in agreement with the previous studies by Wang et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0460\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0465\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>] when 2P is used as a solvent.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0200\" view=\"all\">Although there are numerous studies tackling phase-inversion of casting solution to form membranes, the concept governing demixing is still tricky to understand. Many studies have suggested that if a solvent has a high affinity or high miscibility with the non-solvent, instantaneous demixing would occur. In other words, the fast exchange between the solvent and non-solvent induces the rapid precipitation of the polymer and formation of the film, within seconds of immersion in the coagulation or non-solvent bath. With this type of demixing, a highly porous cross-section (finger-like macrovoids) is obtained. On the other hand, if the solvent has a low affinity towards the non-solvent, a slow exchange occurs, which decelerates the formation of the film. Membranes with relatively dense top layer and sponge-like substructure are achieved during delayed demixing [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0470\" refid=\"bib4\">4</ce:cross-ref>]. However, other studies suggest that instantaneous demixing can help mitigate the formation of macrovoids [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0475\" refid=\"bib79\">79</ce:cross-ref>]. With these ambiguities in membrane formation, Hong et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0480\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>] studied the demixing that transpires during phase separation process.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0205\" view=\"all\">A homogeneous casting solution can be demixed through nucleation and growth (NG) or spinodal decomposition (SD) depending on the solution composition at which the phase separation occurs [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0485\" refid=\"bib80\">80</ce:cross-ref>]. For the demixing to occur via NG, the phase separation composition must lie on the meta-stable or binodal region. Conversely, for SD to happen, the composition path must be found in the unstable or spinodal region. When phase-inversion happens via NG, the resulting morphology consists of nuclei of polymer-poor phase that can grow into macrovoids. Meanwhile, when phase-inversion occurs via SD, the subsequent morphology contains continuous polymer-poor phase but not nuclei type. If the demixing is accompanied by fast solvent and non-solvent exchange, the phase-inversion would typically be via SD, as evidenced by the formation of bi-continuous structure [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0490\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>].</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0210\" view=\"all\">It was previously stated that NMP has a high affinity towards water hence, one would assume that the exchange of solvent and non-solvent is fast enough to cause SD demixing. However, this claim contradicts our observations in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0495\" refid=\"fig3\">Fig. 3</ce:cross-ref>, as cellular-like structures are observed instead of bi-continuous morphology. Meanwhile, 2P has a low miscibility towards water (possible cyclic dimer), so it is expected that phase-inversion would transpire via NG, and poorly interconnected pores on the walls of the macrovoids are to be anticipated. However, the opposite was found on both membranes. To find out why such phenomena were observed, we evaluated the viscosity of both systems as illustrated at the bottom images of <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0500\" refid=\"fig3\">Fig. 3</ce:cross-ref>. Due to the poorer solvency of PSf in 2P, higher viscosity is attained. For the same concentration (15 wt%), PSf/2P system has 41% higher viscosity than PSf/NMP system. This suggest that the high viscosity of PSf/2P system slowed down the solvent and non-solvent exchange which helped maintain the open porous structure and interconnected pores by mitigating the coarsening process. Conversely, NMP is a good solvent for PSf. Its high affinity for water permitted fast solvent and non-solvent exchanges, while the low viscosity (553 cP) of the system could not prevent coarsening during the phase-inversion process. So, phase-inversion may occur by SD, but the structure is not fixed and can still evolve after phase-separation. As a result, large macrovoids were observed across the membrane with cellular-like structure.</ce:para>\n",

       "<ce:para id=\"p0215\" view=\"all\">As stated previously, earlier works did not explore the effect of 2P on the surface morphology of PSf membranes via NIPS process. In this study, we found out that by using 2P as solvent, we could easily obtain PSf membranes in the MF range. Normally, NIPS process generates ultrafiltration membranes as a result of the fast solvent and non-solvent exchange that transpires in the coagulation bath which typically results in the formation of a relatively dense top surface also known as skin layer [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0505\" refid=\"bib49\">49</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-refs id=\"crosrefs0075\" refid=\"bib81 bib82 bib83 bib84\">81–84</ce:cross-refs>]. Based on the study conducted by Strathmann, asymmetric morphology arises from the steep concentration, and activity gradient of the polymer, solvent and non-solvent. If the affinity of the solvent and non-solvent towards each other is high, as soon as the water is introduced on the surface of the film, the resulting chemical composition at the interface reaches in a short time a value indicating a phase separation has occurred, due to the fast mass transfer kinetics between the solvent and non-solvent. Where in fact, the internal of the film is still very far below the binodal point [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0510\" refid=\"bib85\">85</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0515\" refid=\"bib86\">86</ce:cross-ref>]. In order to slow down the exchange at the interface, additives can be introduced into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. That is why researchers commonly incorporate additives such as PEG or PVP to obtain PSf MF. To obtain PSf MF membranes, additives such PEG or PVP are added into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. However, even without additives, PSf/2P system is viscous enough (compared to PSf/NMP) to allow slower mass transfer kinetics during phase-inversion which permitted the formation of porous surface structure as shown in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0520\" refid=\"fig4\">Fig. 4</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig4\"/>. But it is important to note that the amount of solid content would also influence the viscosity of the solution which could decrease the porosity of the membrane. Hence, it is evident in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0525\" refid=\"fig4\">Fig. 4</ce:cross-ref> that the surface porosity decreases with the polysulfone content (which will be verified later by dedicated measurements).</ce:para>\n",

       "<ce:para id=\"p0225\" view=\"all\">In the introduction, we have stated the different ways to suppress macrovoid growth in polymeric membranes. Among these different approaches, adding additives into the casting solution seem to be the easiest and most economical. PVP, PEG, non-solvent, etc., are some of the most used additives to mitigate macrovoid growth. In this study, we chose water as the additive because of its abundancy and availability, cost-effectiveness, and it will not be trapped in the polymer domain (unlike polymeric additives) during the phase-inversion process. <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0530\" refid=\"fig5\">Fig. 5</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig5\"/> shows the entire cross-section of the different membranes prepared: P8, P10, P12, and P15 which consist of 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf in 2P, respectively. The amount of water added into the casting solution was dependent on the cloud point evaluation from <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0535\" refid=\"fig2\">Fig. 2</ce:cross-ref>, that is to avoid phase-separation of the casting solution. For P8, the amount of DI water was varied from 0 to 1.5 wt%. Meanwhile, for P10 and P12, 0–1.0 wt% of water was added. Lastly, for P12, the concentration of DI water was from 0 to 0.8 wt%. As can be seen below, it is evident that as the concentration of PSf in the casting solution is increased (from P8 to P15), the initiation position of the macrovoid could be found deeper in the cross-section of the membranes. This can be explained by the increase in viscosity of the casting solution, which slowed down the mass transfer kinetics (this will be proven in the next section). After water was added into the casting solution of P8, it was found that the initial position of macrovoid formation appeared deeper in the cross-section of the membrane. Consequently, when more water was added (P8-D1.5), all the macrovoids were suppressed. Similar trends were observed in P8, P12 and P15, as more non-solvent is introduced in the casting solution, complete macrovoid suppression was achieved. In addition, the bi-continuous structure was well maintained in all conditions as evidenced in the SEM images in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0540\" refid=\"fig6\">Fig. 6</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig6\"/> which displays the higher magnification of the middle part of the cross-section. Moreover, no skin layer is observable in all PSf membranes as illustrated in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0545\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S1</ce:cross-ref>. In contrast, it seems that the amount of additive did not directly affect the surface morphology of the membranes (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0550\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S2</ce:cross-ref>), which all remained highly porous.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0230\" view=\"all\">It is a known fact that as the amount of solid content in the casting solution is increased, the porosity and pore size of the membranes would decrease. Therefore, a decline in the porosity and pore size of the membranes (P8 &gt; P10 &gt; P12 &gt; P15) is expected, and is proven in <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0555\" refid=\"fig7\">Fig. 7</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig7\"/>. Based on this illustration, the porosity of the pristine membranes gradually decreased from 88% to 76% when the PSf concentration was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%. Likewise, the pore size was reduced from 0.65 μm to 0.30 μm. It was also apparent that the incorporation of non-solvent also resulted in a decrease in porosity and pore size of the membranes (in the same PSf concentration). The decrease in porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the disappearance of the large voids across the membranes. However, it is important to note that as the solid content is the same with and without water, we should acknowledge that porosity difference could only be due to the membrane thickness differences (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0560\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S3</ce:cross-ref>). For a same solid content and a same thickness, the porosity should be the same, regardless of the presence of macrovoids.</ce:para>\n",

With this, we measured the viscosity of PSf/2P casting solutions and of PSf/2P/water solutions. Since the viscosity of the polymer solution is shear-rate dependent, we report in the following zero-shear viscosity. The solution viscosity logically increased with increasing polymer concentration (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0570\" refid=\"fig8\">Fig. 8</ce:cross-ref>\n",
       "<ce:float-anchor refid=\"fig8\"/>). Moreover, the viscosity tended to be low and constant below a certain concentration threshold and then drastically increased. According to polymer solution theory, there is a critical overlap concentration (<ce:italic>C*</ce:italic>) of polymer coils, which is the crossover concentration between the dilute and the semi-dilute concentration region. If the concentration of the polymer is below <ce:italic>C*</ce:italic>, the polymer clusters are segregated from each other, and it is commonly referred to as dilute regime. On the other hand, if the concentration is above <ce:italic>C*,</ce:italic> the solution becomes entangled as a result of the overlap between adjacent macromolecular coils. The concentration of the polymer at which the onset of significant entanglement occurs is pertained to as critical entanglement concentration (<ce:italic>C</ce:italic>\n",
       "<ce:inf loc=\"post\">\n",

PSf is predominantly hydrophobic due to the large presence of aryl groups. When water is added into the system, the PSf chains will be oriented in a way that the hydrophilic segments, sulfonyl and ether groups, are exposed which was induced by hydrophobic hydration [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0585\" refid=\"bib89\">89</ce:cross-ref>]. This phenomenon triggers the aryl groups to be “coiled up or hidden” to decrease the enthalpy of the system creating spots of cohesion entanglement among the PSf chains (as shown in the insets of <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0590\" refid=\"fig8\">Fig. 8</ce:cross-ref>). Moreover, as stated in the previous studies of Kahrs and Schellenbach [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0595\" refid=\"bib38\">38</ce:cross-ref>], Wang et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0600\" refid=\"bib39\">39</ce:cross-ref>,<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0605\" refid=\"bib40\">40</ce:cross-ref>], Mousavi and Zadhoush [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0610\" refid=\"bib41\">41</ce:cross-ref>], and Mousavi et al. [<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0615\" refid=\"bib42\">42</ce:cross-ref>], the addition of water into the casting solution could lead to interchain hydrogen bonding which can result in increased which can result in decreased solvent power and aggregation of the macromolecules which then induces the viscosity of the system to be enhanced. Therefore, as more water is added into the casting solution, more points of entanglement among the polymer chains are created causing the viscosity to be enhanced.</ce:para>\n",

Correlating these values with the SEM from <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0630\" refid=\"fig5\">Fig. 5</ce:cross-ref>, we can infer that the addition of water has caused the onset of chain entanglement which evidently increased the viscosity which aided in the mitigation of macrovoid growth. Also, when the polymer concentration in the casting solution is higher than the critical chain entanglement, the initiation position of macrovoids shifted to somewhere below the membrane surface. Conversely, when there is no chain entanglement (PSf-D0), macrovoids are present along the cross-section of the membrane. In addition, when more non-solvent additive is added into the casting solution, the entanglement concentration was found to decrease (increased chain entanglement), suggesting that for a much lower polymer concentration, we can fine-tune the substructure of the membrane. This can provide positive impacts in terms of fabricating membranes at a more cost-effective approach.</ce:para>\n",

At the outset, it is important to note that the mechanical strength of the membrane is in correlation to the concentration of the polymer. Therefore, it is obvious that as the concentration of PSf is increased, the modulus of elasticity also increased from 40 to 130 MPa. Besides, as we increased the PSf concentration in 2P, we were also able to prevent the initiation of macrovoid growth near the top part of the membrane and then the formation of the macrovoids across the entire cross-section of the membranes. This has led to the increase in the modulus of elasticity of the modified membranes. Additionally, we compared the mechanical strength of PSf membrane prepared with 2P to that of prepared using NMP (<ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0715\" refid=\"appsec1\">Fig. S6</ce:cross-ref>). As expected, the large macrovoids found in PSf/NMP membranes acted as weak spots which contributed to it having lower tensile strength.</ce:para>\n",
       "<ce:para id=\"p0300\" view=\"all\">To summarize, using 2P as a solvent allowed the easy fabrication of PSf MF (skin-free) membranes through NIPS process, which is deemed difficult to achieve using other solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc without the addition of additives. However, macrovoids are still present along its cross-section. The addition of a sufficient amount of water (which content is dependent upon the phase diagram) permits to totally suppress the macrovoids without sacrificing the pore size and porosity of the membranes. So, skin-free and macrovoids-free PSf membranes can be prepared using 2P as the solvent and water as a non-solvent additive. As the pore connectivity is maintained, so is the membrane permeability. But as the morphology of the cross-section is no longer asymmetric with large macrovoids, instead replaced with symmetric with continuous connected domains, the mechanical strength of the membranes was enhanced without waiving the permeability. These findings could help provide an easy and economical approach to suppress macrovoids without using expensive organic or inorganic additives, or using intricate methods to fabricate macrovoid-free membranes. <ce:cross-ref id=\"crosref0720\" refid=\"fig16\">Fig. 16</ce:cross-ref>\n",

       "['Versatile, facile, easy, and economical, these are the advantages that immersion precipitation or non-solvent phase separation (NIPS) offers [1-3]. Due to these, NIPS process has been regarded as the most widely-used approach in fabricating flat sheet membranes from a variety of polymers [4]. In addition, NIPS can provide a wide-range of pore size: from microfiltration to nanofiltration [5]. In this process, a polymer of choice is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Once homogeneous, the polymeric solution is cast onto a support and phase-inversion is prompted through direct immersion in a coagulation bath/non-solvent bath (typically water), generating a polymer rich phase that transforms into the membrane matrix after polymer precipitation, and a polymer lean phase which develops into pores after demixing [6].',\n",
       " 'Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is amongst the most extensively used commercial membranes due to its favorable attributes such as high glass transition temperature (Tg = 190 degC), high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance over a wide-range of pH, good thermal resistance, exceptional biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication [7-9]. PSf membranes are commonly used in wastewater treatment [10-14], hemodialysis [15-17], protein purification [18-22], food processing [23], and so on. Polar solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [1,24-27], N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [9,28-31], and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) [32-35] are usually used to dissolved PSf polymers. Utilizing these solvents to prepare PSf membranes via NIPS process generally leads to formation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with relatively dense surface structure and porous sub-structure. Meanwhile, the cross-section of these membranes is composed of large macrovoids with walls having cellular-like structure [36] which could generate low flux due to the closed-pore structure (the pores are not interconnected with each other) that could potentially slow down the flow of water across the membrane. Additionally, concerns have been expressed on the use of such solvents to prepare polymeric membranes due to their toxicity which can cause adverse effects to our health. Besides, during NIPS process, these solvents are released into the coagulation bath during the membrane formation, and residual solvents are further extracted in the washing bath. These constitute to the release of 20-50 billion liters of contaminated water annually [1,37], and if not properly treated, can create immense damages to the environment. Hence, the use of these solvents in industries are now strictly regulated. In May 2020, the European Union has imposed a mandate on the use of NMP which has led researchers to find \"greener\" and more sustainable solvents [24,37] that have high affinity towards the PSf polymer. Alongside the prospect of tuning the morphology and suppressing macrovoids using alternative solvents.',\n",
       " 'As a result of the raising interest to improve the sustainability of PSf membrane production, several different solvents have been investigated in the past with respect to their suitability for replacing harmful solvents. In recent studies conducted by Kahrs and Schwellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42] the use of utilizing 2-pyrrolidone (2P) solvent as a substitute for NMP was explored. 2P is an organic compound derived from g-butyrolactone with considerable similarities with NMP as shown in Table 1. To date, there are no known life-threatening risks accompanied by using 2P, making it a potential alternative for NMP.',\n",
       " \"Standard NIPS process yield skinned asymmetric membranes with large macrovoids that could either have closed pore (cellular) structure or interconnected open pore (bi-continuous structure) [39,43]. Macrovoids are defects that grow perpendicular or near perpendicular to the skin or top layer [44]. They are large in size, and have elongated or teardrop-shaped pores ranging from 10 to 50 mm [45]. The presence of these large macrovoids can weaken the structural integrity of the membranes which can lead to breakage and total failure during operation [46]. Since the first development of phase-inversion process by Leob and Sourirajan in the 1960's [47], macrovoid formation have confounded researchers which has led to the development of different studies to understand macrovoid formation [39,44,48]. Numerous models were proposed for the formation of macrovoids. Early on, Reuvers and Smolders suggested that macrovoids were formed as the result of the nucleation of the polymer poor phase [49]. Strathmann et al. explained that the macrovoid was initiated by the rupture of the polymeric skin caused by shrinkage stress-induced-syneresis [50]. Other researchers considered that macrovoid formation stemmed from the thermodynamics aspects of chemical potential gradient [43,51-53]. Additional theories include Marangoni effects [54], solutocapillary convection mechanism [55-57], osmotic pressure [58] and combination of different mechanisms [59]. Nonetheless, several methods have been investigated to reduce macrovoid formation during immersion precipitation due to their weak mechanical strength. These include (i) choosing a solvent and non-solvent pair with low affinity towards each other; (ii) increasing the viscosity of the casting solution by increasing the polymer concentration or adding additives; and (iii) adding solvent to the coagulation bath [39,43,60-62].\",\n",
       " 'Although adding solvent to the coagulation bath seem to be the easiest option however, this could lead to increased production costs and pollution. The addition of additives has been the most explored strategies to mitigate the growth of macrovoids, and adding amounts of hydrophilic polymers such polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most predominant [63-65]. Some studies revealed that the addition of these hydrophilic polymers can enlarge the size of the macrovoids, while other studies reported the opposite as highlighted in the study by Sadrzadeh and Bhattacharjee [64]. These inconsistencies could be due to the fact that PVP and PEG are originally utilized as pore formers for polymeric membranes. They form pores as they leach out of the cast film upon immersion in the coagulation bath. However, depending on the molecular weights of the PVP and PEG [64], some can get trapped in the polymeric matrix. Therefore, the molecular weights of these materials have to be taken into great considerations before being used to suppress macrovoids. On the other hand, other researchers have used non-solvents such as water [24,38,39,66], ethanol [65] and other organic solvents [66,67] to control the exchange rates of the solvent and coagulant. Among these, water appear to be the most logical option due to its accessibility, abundancy, low-cost, and non-toxicity.',\n",
       " 'As of this writing, there are only 4 published works on PSf/2P system. Mousavi and colleagues intensively worked on the dynamics of using 2P as a sole solvent for PSf, and a co-solvent, and how the rheology of these conditions contributed to the resulting cross-section structure of PSf membranes [41,42]. Since standard NIPS process produce ultrafiltration PSf membrane, Wang et al. in their earlier work [40], explored the use of vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process to obtain PSf membranes with highly porous surface and cross-section. Recently, Wang and colleagues observed the macrovoid initiation position in PSf/2P system prepared by NIPS process [39]. These previous works have provided initial understanding on the solvency of PSf in 2P, and on how the viscoelasticity of the casting solution affects the cross-section of PSf membranes. It is important to note that, except for the work on PSf/2P using VIPS process, the other studies only focused on the morphology of the cross-section of PSf membranes, specifically on the growth of macrovoids.',\n",
       " 'This study encompasses two major objectives: (i) fabrication of highly porous PSf membranes through NIPS process using 2P as the solvent, and (ii) the suppression of macrovoid growth by using water as a non-solvent additive in the PSf/2P casting solution. Although, other studies [38,39] have previously explored the feasibility of this concept, they have not fully determined the amount of water that can be added to achieve macrovoid-free PSf membranes. Moreover, in this study, in-depth evaluations of the physical properties such morphology, porosity, pore size, permeability, and mechanical property of the PSf membranes with respect to the concentration of the additive are thoroughly carried out. Fig. 1 shows the three major parts of this study. The first part, heavily revolves on trying to understand how the nature of solvency of 2P affects the morphology of the PSf membranes, and its viability as a replacement for NMP solvent. Next, once the fundamental concepts of 2P/PSf system are established, the use of water as an additive in the casting solution to suppress macrovoids is examined. Herein, we shall probe into the viscosity of the solution, study the ternary diagram, and investigate the kinetics that took place during phase-inversion. In addition, comprehensive analysis of the physical properties of the membranes such as porosity, pore size, morphology, permeability, and mechanical properties will be examined. Lastly, the potential application of this concept will also be extended to other systems such as PSf/NMP, PSf/DMAc, and PSf/DMF to test the practicality of using water to suppress macrovoids.',\n",

       " \"The nature of the solvent plays a pertinent role in the morphology of the membranes [71]. For many years, Hansen's solubility parameters have been used as a guide in understanding the solubility of the polymer in a particular solvent. In this study, we have used equation (2a) to determine the solubility of PSf polymer in different solvents:(2a)dS-P= [(dD,S- dD,P)2 + (dP,S- dP,P)2 + (dH,S- dH,P)2]0.5Where dD, dP, and dH pertain to the van der Waals or dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding forces, respectively. The suffix S and P refer to solvent and polymer. Parameters for different PSf/solvent systems are provided in Table 2. From this, it can be inferred that out of the 3 solvents, PSf has the highest affinity towards DMF, followed by NMP, DMAc and 2P.\",\n",
       " 'Among the different mathematical models used to describe the thermodynamics of ternary systems, Flory-Huggins theory is the most sought after due to its relatively simple mathematical model and good accuracy of the phase behavior [72,73]. It is important to note that by constructing the ternary thermodynamics phase diagram of the phase-inversion process, we can get an insight into the composition paths of the demixed system. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (Table 3) of the systems can be estimated using the solubility parameters from Table 2, and their relationship can be transcribed to equation (3a) [73]:(3a)khi3=V1RT(d1-d2)2i=1,2where khi3 is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, V1 is the pure molar volume for component 1, and d1 is the solubility parameter for component i. Later, Hansen introduced a correction factor, a:(4)khi3=aV1RT[(d1,d-d2,d)2+0.25(d1,p-d2,p)2+0.25(d1,h-d2,h)2i=1,2',\n",
       " \"Fig. 2 illustrates the ternary diagrams of (a) PSf/NMP//water and (b) PSf/2P/water. The binary interaction parameters (kh) such as PSf-2P, PSf-water, and 2P-water used in this study were similar to that of Wang's group [40]. In their work, they used the same values of khNMP-water for kh2P-water. According to their calculations (with the data of excess Gibbs free energy reported from Ref. [75]), the values of khNMP-water and kh2P-water at 40 degC are close hence, they assumed that they are also close at 25 degC. They further verified this by measuring the water compositions in the 2P/water and NMP/water when they are in equilibrium with water vapor in the humid air (25 degC, 70% relative humidity) which showed similar values of both binary interactions. Although the similarity between NMP and 2P (Table 1) is quite intriguing in spite of the increased hydrogen bonding of 2P, it was indicated by Aparicio et al. [76], that 2P supposedly favors forming cyclic dimer due to the inter-molecule hydrogen bonding. Instead of forming hydrogen bond with water, it forms a cyclic dimer that weakens its affinity towards water.\",\n",
       " 'In addition, the solvent-polymer interaction (khPSf-2P and khPSf-NMP) also provides a quantitative information on the degree of interaction of polymer and solvent. According to literature [72], if khpolymer-solvent is less than 0.5, the solvent has high affinity towards the polymer, and is considered a good solvent. Conversely, if it is higher than 0.5, it is regarded as a poor solvent. As shown in Tables 2 and 2P is a poorer solvent than NMP therefore, the homogeneous region of PSf/2P/water phase diagram is narrower than PSf/NMP/water. This indicates that it would take less amount of non-solvent (water) to induce demixing in PSf/2P system. The cloud points in Fig. 2 denoted the amount of water needed to demix the system. For PSf/2P system, it takes about 2 wt% of water to phase separate the solution, and as the amount of PSf in the solution is increased, it takes a lesser amount of non-solvent to induce phase-inversion. With this knowledge, we can identify how much non-solvent additive we can add into the casting solution without causing phase-inversion. Another key parameter that must be considered is the relative energy difference (RED) which provides information on whether the parameters of the two molecules (usually a polymer and solvent) are within range. This can be measured according to the following equations [2,77,78]:(5)Ro=(dD2+dP2)0.5-dH(6)Ra2=4(dD,P-dD,S)2+(dP,P-dP,S)2+(dH,P-dH,S)2(7)RED=RaRo',\n",
       " 'Ro denotes the interaction radius of the polymer, and Ra refers to the solubility parameter distance. The ratio of Ra and Ro tells us that if it is < 1, the polymer is soluble in the chosen solvent, while the opposite transpires if it is > 1, and if the ratio is 1, the polymer can only be partially dissolved in the solvent. The calculated RED of the systems are 0.72, and 0.69 for PSf/2P and PSf/NMP, respectively. Hence, we can confirm that PSf polymer is soluble in 2P, and be can be used as a \"greener\" solvent replacement for NMP.',\n",
       " 'Fig. 3 shows the comparison of two PSf membranes (having the same concentration) fabricated via NIPS using 2 different solvents. Left-hand figure displays the surface and cross-section morphology of the PSf membrane when NMP was used as a solvent, while the right-hand figure represents the PSf/2P system. Starting with the PSf/NMP system, a dense surface structure was obtained which is consistent with other published works [1,24-27] while, a skinned asymmetric membrane with large finger-like macrovoids extending from the top part to the bottom part of the membranes with walls having cellular-like structure was obtained. In contrast, when 2P was used as a solvent, the surface structure of the PSf membranes have obvious large pores in the microfiltration (MF) range (to be confirmed in sections 3.2 and 3.3). Meanwhile, it appears that the macrovoids were found at the deeper part of the membrane. Zoomed-in images of the membrane reveal that instead of cellular-like structure, 2P solvent generated interconnected pores or bi-continuous structure which is in agreement with the previous studies by Wang et al. [39,40] when 2P is used as a solvent.',\n",
       " 'Although there are numerous studies tackling phase-inversion of casting solution to form membranes, the concept governing demixing is still tricky to understand. Many studies have suggested that if a solvent has a high affinity or high miscibility with the non-solvent, instantaneous demixing would occur. In other words, the fast exchange between the solvent and non-solvent induces the rapid precipitation of the polymer and formation of the film, within seconds of immersion in the coagulation or non-solvent bath. With this type of demixing, a highly porous cross-section (finger-like macrovoids) is obtained. On the other hand, if the solvent has a low affinity towards the non-solvent, a slow exchange occurs, which decelerates the formation of the film. Membranes with relatively dense top layer and sponge-like substructure are achieved during delayed demixing [4]. However, other studies suggest that instantaneous demixing can help mitigate the formation of macrovoids [79]. With these ambiguities in membrane formation, Hong et al. [39] studied the demixing that transpires during phase separation process.',\n",
       " 'A homogeneous casting solution can be demixed through nucleation and growth (NG) or spinodal decomposition (SD) depending on the solution composition at which the phase separation occurs [80]. For the demixing to occur via NG, the phase separation composition must lie on the meta-stable or binodal region. Conversely, for SD to happen, the composition path must be found in the unstable or spinodal region. When phase-inversion happens via NG, the resulting morphology consists of nuclei of polymer-poor phase that can grow into macrovoids. Meanwhile, when phase-inversion occurs via SD, the subsequent morphology contains continuous polymer-poor phase but not nuclei type. If the demixing is accompanied by fast solvent and non-solvent exchange, the phase-inversion would typically be via SD, as evidenced by the formation of bi-continuous structure [39].',\n",
       " 'It was previously stated that NMP has a high affinity towards water hence, one would assume that the exchange of solvent and non-solvent is fast enough to cause SD demixing. However, this claim contradicts our observations in Fig. 3, as cellular-like structures are observed instead of bi-continuous morphology. Meanwhile, 2P has a low miscibility towards water (possible cyclic dimer), so it is expected that phase-inversion would transpire via NG, and poorly interconnected pores on the walls of the macrovoids are to be anticipated. However, the opposite was found on both membranes. To find out why such phenomena were observed, we evaluated the viscosity of both systems as illustrated at the bottom images of Fig. 3. Due to the poorer solvency of PSf in 2P, higher viscosity is attained. For the same concentration (15 wt%), PSf/2P system has 41% higher viscosity than PSf/NMP system. This suggest that the high viscosity of PSf/2P system slowed down the solvent and non-solvent exchange which helped maintain the open porous structure and interconnected pores by mitigating the coarsening process. Conversely, NMP is a good solvent for PSf. Its high affinity for water permitted fast solvent and non-solvent exchanges, while the low viscosity (553 cP) of the system could not prevent coarsening during the phase-inversion process. So, phase-inversion may occur by SD, but the structure is not fixed and can still evolve after phase-separation. As a result, large macrovoids were observed across the membrane with cellular-like structure.',\n",
       " 'As stated previously, earlier works did not explore the effect of 2P on the surface morphology of PSf membranes via NIPS process. In this study, we found out that by using 2P as solvent, we could easily obtain PSf membranes in the MF range. Normally, NIPS process generates ultrafiltration membranes as a result of the fast solvent and non-solvent exchange that transpires in the coagulation bath which typically results in the formation of a relatively dense top surface also known as skin layer [49,81-84]. Based on the study conducted by Strathmann, asymmetric morphology arises from the steep concentration, and activity gradient of the polymer, solvent and non-solvent. If the affinity of the solvent and non-solvent towards each other is high, as soon as the water is introduced on the surface of the film, the resulting chemical composition at the interface reaches in a short time a value indicating a phase separation has occurred, due to the fast mass transfer kinetics between the solvent and non-solvent. Where in fact, the internal of the film is still very far below the binodal point [85,86]. In order to slow down the exchange at the interface, additives can be introduced into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. That is why researchers commonly incorporate additives such as PEG or PVP to obtain PSf MF. To obtain PSf MF membranes, additives such PEG or PVP are added into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. However, even without additives, PSf/2P system is viscous enough (compared to PSf/NMP) to allow slower mass transfer kinetics during phase-inversion which permitted the formation of porous surface structure as shown in Fig. 4. But it is important to note that the amount of solid content would also influence the viscosity of the solution which could decrease the porosity of the membrane. Hence, it is evident in Fig. 4 that the surface porosity decreases with the polysulfone content (which will be verified later by dedicated measurements).',\n",
       " 'The preceding results show that by using 2P as a solvent for PSf polymers, membrane with bi-continuous morphology in the entire cross-section can obtained. Having bi-continuous structure would be beneficial for faster permeation unlike cellular-like structure which are closed pores (not interconnected).',\n",
       " 'In the introduction, we have stated the different ways to suppress macrovoid growth in polymeric membranes. Among these different approaches, adding additives into the casting solution seem to be the easiest and most economical. PVP, PEG, non-solvent, etc., are some of the most used additives to mitigate macrovoid growth. In this study, we chose water as the additive because of its abundancy and availability, cost-effectiveness, and it will not be trapped in the polymer domain (unlike polymeric additives) during the phase-inversion process. Fig. 5 shows the entire cross-section of the different membranes prepared: P8, P10, P12, and P15 which consist of 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf in 2P, respectively. The amount of water added into the casting solution was dependent on the cloud point evaluation from Fig. 2, that is to avoid phase-separation of the casting solution. For P8, the amount of DI water was varied from 0 to 1.5 wt%. Meanwhile, for P10 and P12, 0-1.0 wt% of water was added. Lastly, for P12, the concentration of DI water was from 0 to 0.8 wt%. As can be seen below, it is evident that as the concentration of PSf in the casting solution is increased (from P8 to P15), the initiation position of the macrovoid could be found deeper in the cross-section of the membranes. This can be explained by the increase in viscosity of the casting solution, which slowed down the mass transfer kinetics (this will be proven in the next section). After water was added into the casting solution of P8, it was found that the initial position of macrovoid formation appeared deeper in the cross-section of the membrane. Consequently, when more water was added (P8-D1.5), all the macrovoids were suppressed. Similar trends were observed in P8, P12 and P15, as more non-solvent is introduced in the casting solution, complete macrovoid suppression was achieved. In addition, the bi-continuous structure was well maintained in all conditions as evidenced in the SEM images in Fig. 6 which displays the higher magnification of the middle part of the cross-section. Moreover, no skin layer is observable in all PSf membranes as illustrated in Fig. S1. In contrast, it seems that the amount of additive did not directly affect the surface morphology of the membranes (Fig. S2), which all remained highly porous.',\n",
       " 'It is a known fact that as the amount of solid content in the casting solution is increased, the porosity and pore size of the membranes would decrease. Therefore, a decline in the porosity and pore size of the membranes (P8 > P10 > P12 > P15) is expected, and is proven in Fig. 7. Based on this illustration, the porosity of the pristine membranes gradually decreased from 88% to 76% when the PSf concentration was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%. Likewise, the pore size was reduced from 0.65 mm to 0.30 mm. It was also apparent that the incorporation of non-solvent also resulted in a decrease in porosity and pore size of the membranes (in the same PSf concentration). The decrease in porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the disappearance of the large voids across the membranes. However, it is important to note that as the solid content is the same with and without water, we should acknowledge that porosity difference could only be due to the membrane thickness differences (Fig. S3). For a same solid content and a same thickness, the porosity should be the same, regardless of the presence of macrovoids.',\n",
       " 'The viscosity of the casting solutions holds a vital role in determining the morphology of the membranes [40]. With this, we measured the viscosity of PSf/2P casting solutions and of PSf/2P/water solutions. Since the viscosity of the polymer solution is shear-rate dependent, we report in the following zero-shear viscosity. The solution viscosity logically increased with increasing polymer concentration (Fig. 8). Moreover, the viscosity tended to be low and constant below a certain concentration threshold and then drastically increased. According to polymer solution theory, there is a critical overlap concentration (C*) of polymer coils, which is the crossover concentration between the dilute and the semi-dilute concentration region. If the concentration of the polymer is below C*, the polymer clusters are segregated from each other, and it is commonly referred to as dilute regime. On the other hand, if the concentration is above C*, the solution becomes entangled as a result of the overlap between adjacent macromolecular coils. The concentration of the polymer at which the onset of significant entanglement occurs is pertained to as critical entanglement concentration (Ce), and it is within the semi-dilute entangled regime [87,88]. PSf is predominantly hydrophobic due to the large presence of aryl groups. When water is added into the system, the PSf chains will be oriented in a way that the hydrophilic segments, sulfonyl and ether groups, are exposed which was induced by hydrophobic hydration [89]. This phenomenon triggers the aryl groups to be \"coiled up or hidden\" to decrease the enthalpy of the system creating spots of cohesion entanglement among the PSf chains (as shown in the insets of Fig. 8). Moreover, as stated in the previous studies of Kahrs and Schellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42], the addition of water into the casting solution could lead to interchain hydrogen bonding which can result in increased which can result in decreased solvent power and aggregation of the macromolecules which then induces the viscosity of the system to be enhanced. Therefore, as more water is added into the casting solution, more points of entanglement among the polymer chains are created causing the viscosity to be enhanced.',\n",
       " 'By taking the straight lines used to fit the curves of the log-log plot of the zero-shear viscosity and PSf concentration (Fig. 9), we were able to determine the critical overlap concentration and the critical entanglement concentration of the casting solutions without additive, and with 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% water. In Fig. 9a, in which no additive was additive into the casting solutions, we determined that the C* is 9.7 wt%, and no onset of entanglement occurred from 2 wt% to 18 wt% (it is probable that Ce would occur at higher concentrations). However, when 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% of water were added into the casting solution, 2 things could be observed: (1) critical chain entanglement ensued; and (2) both values of C* and Ce decreased with increasing amount of additive added. Correlating these values with the SEM from Fig. 5, we can infer that the addition of water has caused the onset of chain entanglement which evidently increased the viscosity which aided in the mitigation of macrovoid growth. Also, when the polymer concentration in the casting solution is higher than the critical chain entanglement, the initiation position of macrovoids shifted to somewhere below the membrane surface. Conversely, when there is no chain entanglement (PSf-D0), macrovoids are present along the cross-section of the membrane. In addition, when more non-solvent additive is added into the casting solution, the entanglement concentration was found to decrease (increased chain entanglement), suggesting that for a much lower polymer concentration, we can fine-tune the substructure of the membrane. This can provide positive impacts in terms of fabricating membranes at a more cost-effective approach.',\n",
       " \"Aside from this, we have also analyzed the viscoelastic properties of the casting solution and how it is being influenced by the addition of water. Fig. S4 presents the graph of the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G'') as a function of angular frequency. The storage modulus is a measure of the elasticity of the solution and pertains to its ability to store energy. On the other hand, the loss modulus is a measure of the viscosity of the solution and pertains to its ability to dissipate. If G'' > G' the system behaves like a liquid while if the G'' < G' behaves like a gel [87]. Based on Fig. S4, all the systems exhibit a viscous behavior. When water is added, both G' and G'' visibly increased which can be attributed to the enhanced viscosity induced by the hydrogen bonding and subsequent chain entanglement [41].\",\n",
       " 'Aside from probing into the thermodynamics and viscosity of the PSf/2P/water system, it is also essential to investigate the kinetics of the phase-inversion process. We observed the movement of the phase separation front of the casting solutions with varying concentrations of polysulfone under an optical microscope as depicted in Fig. 10. As it was pointed out in the previous sections of this work, higher viscosity could slow down the kinetics of the mass transfer hence, when the concentration of PSf was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%, it was clear that it took the non-solvent a longer time to traverse the P15 system.',\n",
       " 'In fact, when comparing the position of the diffusion front as a function of time for different concentration of PSf in 2P without additives as illustrated in Fig. 11a, after 120 s of phase inversion, the non-solvent travelled a distance of 0.45 mm, 0.32 mm, 0.30 mm, 0.25 mm for P8, P10, P12 and P15, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 11b presents the related diffusion distance vs. square root of time plot.',\n",
       " 'Assuming that the dark ridges found after the interface corresponds to the initial diffusion position of water, then the diffusivity of water in the system (Dw/s) can be determined based on the equation proposed by Strathmann et al. [61].(2b)d2=4(Dw/set)(1-CW1+CW)twhere d denotes the diffusion distance, e/t represents a geometrical factor for the porosity and tortuosity of the membrane being formed, CW is the water concentration at the interface between the non-solvent and the polymeric system, t pertains to time.',\n",
       " 'Under the supposition that the concentration of water in the solution at the point of precipitation is small relative to unity so, equation (2b) can be simplified to the following expression (equation (3b)) to determine the effective diffusivity De. This De contains the geometrical correction factor e/t.(3b)d=2(Det)0.5',\n",
       " 'With the above expression, the calculated effective diffusivity of water in P8, P10, P12 and P15 are 3.23 x 10-4, 2.60 x 10-4, 2.51 x 10-4 and 2.08 x 10-4 mm2/s, respectively. Thus, verifying our previous claim that with higher viscosity, kinetics of mass transfer was evidently slowed down.',\n",
       " 'Next, the kinetics of non-solvent (water) in the PSf/2P/water casting solutions were examined and presented in Fig. 12. In P8 system, no significant trend was seen which could be attributed to the considerably lower viscosity of the system. Moreover, due to the low polymer concentration (8 wt%), the position of the system lies close to the binodal line, which makes it easier to become thermodynamically unstable. On the other hand, in P10 - P15 systems, it was evident that there is an increasing trend in the non-solvent kinetics when the amount of additive was increased. This was then further verified by calculating the diffusion rates of the non-solvent as presented in Fig. 13.',\n",
       " 'In 2010, Hong et al. proposed a model for the initiation of macrovoids based on the relationship of the initial position of the macrovoid (L) and effective diffusivity (De, which is similar to diffusion coefficient) versus the normalized polymer concentration(C/Ce) [39]. According to their study, the PSf/2P, PSf/2P/water (0.5 wt%), and PSf/NMP systems can be fitted into an exponential growth curve. Similar relationship is also observed in our PSf/2P/water system as presented in Fig. S5.',\n",
       " 'Although macrovoids permits fast permeability due to their high porosity, they are considered weak points in the membrane because they are prone to compaction under high pressure operation, which eventually leads to poor flux performance over time. From the previous sections, we have provided data that shows the by adding water into the casting solution, we are able to successfully mitigate the growth of these unwanted macrovoids. Moreover, we have offered in-depth analysis as to how the thermodynamics of the ternary system, kinetics and viscosity affect the morphology of the membranes. To further our study, we have investigated the effects of incorporating additives into the casting solution to help suppress macrovoids to the permeability properties and mechanical strengths of the membranes as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Since Figs. 4 and 5 prove that all of the fabricated membranes are suitable for microfiltration, we decided to investigate the pure water flux of the pristine and modified PSf membranes under a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar. Fig. 14 shows that even though the macrovoids disappeared, similar permeabilities are still maintained which could be due to two possible reasons: First, the additive concentration did not directly influence the surface porosity of the membranes having the same polymeric content. Second, although the huge macrovoids were suppressed, the interconnected pores along the cross-section still permitted fast permeation.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, Fig. 15 displays the measured modulus of elasticity of the membranes obtained from tensile stress/strain plots. At the outset, it is important to note that the mechanical strength of the membrane is in correlation to the concentration of the polymer. Therefore, it is obvious that as the concentration of PSf is increased, the modulus of elasticity also increased from 40 to 130 MPa. Besides, as we increased the PSf concentration in 2P, we were also able to prevent the initiation of macrovoid growth near the top part of the membrane and then the formation of the macrovoids across the entire cross-section of the membranes. This has led to the increase in the modulus of elasticity of the modified membranes. Additionally, we compared the mechanical strength of PSf membrane prepared with 2P to that of prepared using NMP (Fig. S6). As expected, the large macrovoids found in PSf/NMP membranes acted as weak spots which contributed to it having lower tensile strength.',\n",
       " 'To summarize, using 2P as a solvent allowed the easy fabrication of PSf MF (skin-free) membranes through NIPS process, which is deemed difficult to achieve using other solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc without the addition of additives. However, macrovoids are still present along its cross-section. The addition of a sufficient amount of water (which content is dependent upon the phase diagram) permits to totally suppress the macrovoids without sacrificing the pore size and porosity of the membranes. So, skin-free and macrovoids-free PSf membranes can be prepared using 2P as the solvent and water as a non-solvent additive. As the pore connectivity is maintained, so is the membrane permeability. But as the morphology of the cross-section is no longer asymmetric with large macrovoids, instead replaced with symmetric with continuous connected domains, the mechanical strength of the membranes was enhanced without waiving the permeability. These findings could help provide an easy and economical approach to suppress macrovoids without using expensive organic or inorganic additives, or using intricate methods to fabricate macrovoid-free membranes. Fig. 16 illustrates the short summary of these results.',\n",
       " 'To evaluate the viability of using non-solvent as an additive to suppress macrovoids, we have utilized other solvents such NMP DMAc and DMF to prepare polysulfone membranes. We initially established their respective ternary diagrams (Fig. 2 for PSf/NMP/water and Fig. 17 for PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water) to first identify up to how much water could be added into the casting solution before phase separation occurs. Based on the solubility parameters from Table 1, DMF and DMAc solvents are also considered good solvents to PSf polymer. This is also evidenced by the large homogeneous area of PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water ternary systems illustrated in Fig. 17. Moreover, the cloud points also revealed that it would take more coagulant (water) to induce demixing of the system.',\n",
       " 'In order to find out the versatility of the water as a means to prevent macrovoid formation, we have prepared 25% of PSf in NMP, 20% of PSf in DMAc, and 15% of PSf in DMF via the NIPS process. We have varied the concentrations of the additive from 0 to 3 wt% for PSf/NMP, 0-2 wt% for PSf/DMAc and 0-1 wt% for PSf/DMF casting solutions. The SEM cross-section images in Fig. 18 reveal that when water was added into the casting solution of PSf/NMP, the macrovoids were effectively suppressed. Similar phenomena were observed in PSf membranes prepared using DMAc (Fig. 19a) and DMF (Fig. 19b) solvents. These results prove that using water as an additive in the casting solution provides a practical and cost-effective approach to tune the morphology of polysulfone membranes from controlling the growth of macrovoids to its overall suppression.',\n",
       " 'In this study we first investigated the use of 2P solvent to prepare polysulfone membranes in replace of the more commonly used NMP solvent. Being a poorer solvent than NMP, the nature of solvency of 2P greatly influenced the kinetics, viscosity, and thermodynamics stability of the system. The following major conclusions can be made:*The fabricated membranes are skin-free and fall in the microfiltration range.*The lower affinity of 2P towards polysulfone (compared to NMP) greatly increased the viscosity of the casting solution which prevented coarsening. As a result, bi-continuous substructures were formed.

Meanwhile, to prepare the modified casting solutions, respective amount (wt%) of non-solvent additive (water) was added into the bottle containing 2P, and mixed well for a couple of minutes. Followed by the addition of PSf polymer. The amount of water added was determined based on the cloud point experiment (section 2.2.3). All the casting solutions were dissolved at 60 degC in an oil bath for 1-2 days. Both the casting solutions and membranes are named as Px-Dy in which x and y denote the concentrations of PSf and additive in wt%, respectively. For instance, P8-D1.5 indicates 8 wt% of PSf and 1.5 wt% of DI water.

Next, the purified basil seeds were soaked in DI water at 25 degC for 40 min, leading to swelling their outer layer as a gelatinous layer around the seeds. After that, in order to improve the extraction efficiency, NaOH solution (2%wt.) was added drop-wise into the BSM mixture solution under stirring until adjusting pH to 8, which was conducted for 9 h at 70 degC, after which the extracted BSM and the seeds were completely separated from each other.

Accordingly, in the first step, Al(NO3)3*9H2O, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and DI water were mixed together with a molar ratio of 2:1:160. Subsequently, the as-prepared mixture was placed into a Teflon lined steel autoclave at the temperature of 220 degC for 72 h. After the accomplishment of the reaction, the steel autoclave was gradually cooled down to room temperature (RT). In the next step, a white product with the yield of 97%, based on the organic ligand, was achieved by centrifugation, followed via washing with DI water and drying in a vacuum oven at RT. Finally, the elimination of the excessive 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid which had been adsorbed in the pores was done by using heat treatment at 320 degC for 72 h in air.\n",

      "The PSf membranes were prepared by using vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) method coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) technique (VIPS-NIPS). It is well-known that the addition of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer solution along with applying an evaporation step before immersing the as-cast films into a coagulation bath have been reported for the successfully formation of integrally skinned asymmetric membranes [30]. Hence, a mixture of DMF, as the solvent, and 1,4-dioxane, as the volatile co-solvent, at a 3:1 wt ratio was utilized in this study for the fabrication of dope solutions. Accordingly, precise amounts of MIL-53(Al) were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed by sonication for 180 min in order to prepare homogeneous dispersions. In the next step, PSf with a concentration of 18 wt% was added into the as-prepared dispersions, and completely dissolved after continuously stirring at RT for 2 days. The MIL-53(Al) loading in the final dopes varied from 0 to 7 mg/g of MIL-53(Al) (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 mg/g). The homogenous polymer solution was de-aerated by using a vacuum process for 120 min and cast on a glass plate in a climatic box (relative humidity of 65 +- 5% and temperature 40 degC) by using a Doctor Blade device with a gap of 200 um. Only the MNIPS sample was formed by the NIPS process, and the other membranes were formed by the VIPS-NIPS method. By the coagulation step, the fabricated PSf membranes were separated from the glass plate. The fabricated membranes were stored in a soaking bath containing DI water for 1 day for the complete elimination of the residual solvent, followed by drying at RT. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4, according to the weight percentage of MIL-53(Al). The neat PSf membrane with 0 wt% of MIL-53(Al) was fabricated as the neat membrane and was labelled as M0. Furthermore, to draw a comparison, a membrane was also fabricated by the NIPS method, labelled as MNIPS. The compositions of the casting solutions are exhibited in Table 1.\n",

Deionized (DI) water was obtained using a Merck Mili-Q purification system among the whole experiment. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mw = 67,000 g/mol, Macklin, China) dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0-7.2) was used to evaluate membrane rejection. The concentration of BSA in the solution was 1000 ppm. All reagents were utilized directly without further treatment.\n",

      "The sol-gel method was applied with some modifications to synthesize the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite [40,41]. Firstly, 25 g of SiO2 was constantly mixed in a 125 mL NaOH 2 M for 2 h at 150 degC. After the mixture cooled down, it was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman No. 42) to separate the undissolved SiO2 from the mixture. Then, 1.25 g of ZnO and 1.25 g of MnO2 were added to 25 mL of the filtrate solution, and it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed into an ultrasonic homogenizer at a frequency of 50 kHz for 60 min in order to get better particle dispersions. Dilute solution containing HCl 1 M was added dropwise into the mixture under constant stirring until the mixture turned into gels. The gels were left overnight for the compaction process. Subsequently, the spent solution was removed from the gels using a vacuum filter, and the damp gels were dried in an oven at 110 degC for 12 h. The dried gels were calcinated in a furnace at 500 degC for 5 h to remove the remaining organic substances and bonded water molecules and activate the photocatalysts. Then, it was crushed using a planetary ball mill machine, and the product was sieved to get finer powders.\n",

      "The composite membranes were fabricated by referring to the (NIPS) process [42,43]. Table 2 shows the variation of membrane compositions prepared in this study. In the beginning, a certain amount of PSf pellets were mixed into a 50 mL of NMP solvent until the PSf pellets wholly dissolved. Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife. Then, the casted solution was immersed in a DI water bath to form the membrane sheets, and it was left for 24 h to remove the spent solvent inside the membrane.

      "A casting solution with the composition near the binodal curve was more likely to form a membrane with bicontinuous structure because it had more chance to enter the unstable region rapidly or directly [18]. Thus, a precritical casting solution was prepared in this work. Meanwhile, according to the work by Li et al. [33], SPSf had a great compatibility with polyethersulfone (PESU) at the ratio of 16:84. In consideration of PPSU and PESU both belong to sulfone polymers, the same ratio was adopted in this work. At the same time, a low concentration of polymer would be good for the formation of a membrane with a high permeability so 15 wt% would be a good choice for this work. The steps for preparation of such a precritical casting solution were as followed:\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "First, a certain amount of DMAc was added into the flask, and then different weight percentage of water staring from 0% and then increasing by 0.5% at a time was dropped into DMAc. Afterwards, PPSU (12.6 wt%), SPSf (2.4 wt%) and 20 g PVP (20 wt%, calculated by extra method) were dissolved in DMAc (decreasing from 85 wt% by 0.5 wt% a time) and mixed thoroughly under constant stirring for enough time until a homogeneous solution was formed if possible. The water weight percentage of the casting solution which cannot form homogeneous solution was recorded. Finally, the casting solution prior to the cloudy one was defined as precritical casting solution. To further investigate the properties of the above-mentioned polymer solution, the viscosity and the light transmittance were obtained by a rotational rheometer (Physica MCR-301, Austria) and UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, USA).\n",
      "---------------------------\n",
      "The formation conditions of membranes are presented in Table 1. PPSU and SPSf were dried in vacuum oven at 80 degC for 24h before being used. The polymers and additives were dissolved in DMAc under constant stirring at 70 degC until a homogeneous solution was formed. The solution was allowed to settle and cool to room temperature followed by degassing. The solution then was casted onto a glass plate by hands using a casting knife (Biuged BD201, China) with a gap height of 200 mm and immediately transferred to a programmable humidity and temperature tester (BPS-50CL, China) with the condition of 25 degC and 100% relative humidity (RH) for a period of time (from 0 to 30 s). Both air humidity and exposure time can influence the water adsorption into the membrane. And the adsorbed water in the pristine film from the air essentially influenced the porous structure evolution. Herein we varied the exposure time in 100% humidity to better control the water intrusion into the membrane. After that, the glass plate was immediately taken out and immersed into water coagulation bath maintained at 25 degC until the membrane was peeled off from the glass plate. The resulted membranes were transferred into a fresh deionized water bath at room temperature for 24h, and dried in air before testing and analysis.\n",

All the chemicals were used without further purification. DI water was produced in our lab using an Elga Purelab(r) water purification system. A typical casting solution was prepared by dissolving PSf polymer in 2P solvent. To prepare the pristine casting solutions, 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf polymer were added into the 2P solvent. Meanwhile, to prepare the modified casting solutions, respective amount (wt%) of non-solvent additive (water) was added into the bottle containing 2P, and mixed well for a couple of minutes.

Here, for enhancing the basil seeds purity, impurities washed away with DI water and ethanol, consecutively, and then, the seeds dried at 25 degC. Next, the purified basil seeds were soaked in DI water at 25 degC for 40 min, leading to swelling their outer layer as a gelatinous layer around the seeds. After that, in order to improve the extraction efficiency, NaOH solution (2%wt.) was added drop-wise into the BSM mixture solution under stirring until adjusting pH to 8, which was conducted for 9 h at 70 degC, after which the extracted BSM and the seeds were completely separated from each other. Eventually, using decantation and centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 20 min, BSM was separated. The mucilage hydrogel extraction process is shown in Scheme 1. First, for the fabrication of the mixed matrix membranes, different amounts of the BSM hydrogel were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane/PVP mixtures, followed by sonication for 2 h to prepare homogeneous mixtures.

Congo Red (CR), Methyl Orange (MO) and Methylene Blue (MBe) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai) Reagent Company, Shanghai Maclean Biochemical Technology Company and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent company respectively. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWF was purchased from Hangzhou Water Treatment Center. Preparation of ZIF-8 particles: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in DI water at a concentration of 1.23 g/100 ml and ultrasound for 20 min. At the same time, 2MIM was dissolved in Methanol at a concentration of 0.9 g/100 ml and ultrasound for 20 min. Then 2-MeIM solution were poured into zinc nitrate solution at a 1:6 vol ratio and let alone for another 12 h. The ZIF-8 particles were separated using centrifuging device, and dried at 30 degC in oven for 1 h before use. 18 g of polysulfone (PSF), and various amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM) were added to 74 g of N,N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), as shown in Table 1. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50 degC (200 rpm), a homogeneous casting solution was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The PET NWF were cut into 16cm x 16 cm piece and then was poured and completely wet by a 30 g/L Zn (NO3) 2*6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF was then dried in oven at 30 degC for 0.5 h before use. The fully defoamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 mm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters 0f 14cm x 14 cm, and then immersed into a 50 degC deionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix.

      "Commercial polysulfone (PSf) with molecular weight of 35,000 g.mol-1 (Ultrason(r) 6010P) was supplied by BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 1,4-benzendicarboxylic acid, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), Al(NO3)3*9H2O (99.99%) and 1,4-dioxane were purchased from Merck Co. Ltd. (Darmstadt, Germany). The dyes including Reactive red, Direct yellow, Methyl green and crystal violet were all supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Co. The hydrothermally synthesis of MIL-53 (Al) was conducted according to the literature [30]. Accordingly, in the first step, Al(NO3)3*9H2O, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and DI water were mixed together with a molar ratio of 2:1:160. Subsequently, the as-prepared mixture was placed into a Teflon lined steel autoclave at the temperature of 220 degC for 72 h. After the accomplishment of the reaction, the steel autoclave was gradually cooled down to room temperature (RT). In the next step, a white product with the yield of 97%, based on the organic ligand, was achieved by centrifugation, followed via washing with DI water and drying in a vacuum oven at RT. Finally, the elimination of the excessive 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid which had been adsorbed in the pores was done by using heat treatment at 320 degC for 72 h in air. The PSf membranes were prepared by using vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) method coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) technique (VIPS-NIPS). It is well-known that the addition of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer solution along with applying an evaporation step before immersing the as-cast films into a coagulation bath have been reported for the successfully formation of integrally skinned asymmetric membranes [30]. Hence, a mixture of DMF, as the solvent, and 1,4-dioxane, as the volatile co-solvent, at a 3:1 wt ratio was utilized in this study for the fabrication of dope solutions. Accordingly, precise amounts of MIL-53(Al) were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed by sonication for 180 min in order to prepare homogeneous dispersions. In the next step, PSf with a concentration of 18 wt% was added into the as-prepared dispersions, and completely dissolved after continuously stirring at RT for 2 days. The MIL-53(Al) loading in the final dopes varied from 0 to 7 mg/g of MIL-53(Al) (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 mg/g). The homogenous polymer solution was de-aerated by using a vacuum process for 120 min and cast on a glass plate in a climatic box (relative humidity of 65 +- 5% and temperature 40 degC) by using a Doctor Blade device with a gap of 200 um. Only the MNIPS sample was formed by the NIPS process, and the other membranes were formed by the VIPS-NIPS method. By the coagulation step, the fabricated PSf membranes were separated from the glass plate. The fabricated membranes were stored in a soaking bath containing DI water for 1 day for the complete elimination of the residual solvent, followed by drying at RT. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4, according to the weight percentage of MIL-53(Al). The neat PSf membrane with 0 wt% of MIL-53(Al) was fabricated as the neat membrane and was labelled as M0. Furthermore, to draw a comparison, a membrane was also fabricated by the NIPS method, labelled as MNIPS. The compositions of the casting solutions are exhibited in Table 1.\n",

Polysulfone (PSf, P-3500 LCD MB7, Mw = 77,000-83,000 g/mol, Solvay, Belgium) was chosen to fabricate the membrane. N, N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc, Mw = 87.12 g/mol, Peking Reagent, China) was used as the solvent and polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw = 400 g/mol, MERYER, China) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 8000 g/mol, Innochem, China) were used as the additive in the casting solution. Deionized (DI) water was obtained using a Merck Mili-Q purification system among the whole experiment. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mw = 67,000 g/mol, Macklin, China) dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0-7.2) was used to evaluate membrane rejection. The concentration of BSA in the solution was 1000 ppm. All reagents were utilized directly without further treatment. The casting solution was composed of 19 wt% PSf, 7 wt% PEG, 0.5 wt% PVP and 73.5 wt% DMAc which were filled into a 500 mL flask. Then, the flask was heated to 95 degC by an oil bath. The homogenous casting solution was obtained after continuous stirring for 7 h at 2600 rpm (DF-101S Collective thermostatic heating magnetic stirrer, Shanghai Zhenjie Experimental Equipment Co., China). Lastly, the resulting casting solution was put into a vacuum oven at 25 degC for at least 24 h. PSf support membranes were prepared via NIPS method. NWFs were attached to the steel plate and then the dope solution was casted uniformly by an automatic film applicator (Elcometer 4340 Automatic Film Applicator, Elcometer Co., England) with a steel knife. The relative humidity was determined by adjusting the intensity of automatic humidifier (SC-3K40 air humidifier, Midea Group, China) and using indoor humidity measuring instrument (LondiSun LS-207 electronic moisture meter, Shanghai Diyi Zhan Trading Co., China). The nascent membranes were exposed to atmosphere for several seconds and then soaked into the coagulating bath with different temperature for 30 min to proceed the phase inversion. The prepared membranes were kept in DI water before test. The PSf membranes formed on three different PET NWFs (NWF-01, NWF-02 and NWF-03) were denoted as PSf-NWF-01, PSf-NWF-02, and PSf-NWF-03 membranes, respectively.\n",

The detailed characteristics of the wastewater are presented in Table 1. The sol-gel method was applied with some modifications to synthesize the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite [40,41]. Firstly, 25 g of SiO2 was constantly mixed in a 125 mL NaOH 2 M for 2 h at 150 degC. After the mixture cooled down, it was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman No. 42) to separate the undissolved SiO2 from the mixture. Then, 1.25 g of ZnO and 1.25 g of MnO2 were added to 25 mL of the filtrate solution, and it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed into an ultrasonic homogenizer at a frequency of 50 kHz for 60 min in order to get better particle dispersions. Dilute solution containing HCl 1 M was added dropwise into the mixture under constant stirring until the mixture turned into gels. The gels were left overnight for the compaction process. Subsequently, the spent solution was removed from the gels using a vacuum filter, and the damp gels were dried in an oven at 110 degC for 12 h. The dried gels were calcinated in a furnace at 500 degC for 5 h to remove the remaining organic substances and bonded water molecules and activate the photocatalysts. Then, it was crushed using a planetary ball mill machine, and the product was sieved to get finer powders. The composite membranes were fabricated by referring to the (NIPS) process [42,43]. Table 2 shows the variation of membrane compositions prepared in this study. In the beginning, a certain amount of PSf pellets were mixed into a 50 mL of NMP solvent until the PSf pellets wholly dissolved. Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife. Then, the casted solution was immersed in a DI water bath to form the membrane sheets, and it was left for 24 h to remove the spent solvent inside the membrane. Finally, membrane sheets were dried at an ambient condition.\n",

      "PPSU (P875330, Mw = 54,634 g/mol), n-hexane were purchased from Macklin (China) and SPSf (25% sulfonation degree) was supplied by Shandong Jinlan special polymer Co., Ltd. (China). PVP K30 and isooctane were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). DMAc, nano-silica, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5, water solubility is 17 mg/L [40]) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were all purchased from Aladdin (China). Deionized water was used as nonsolvent additive and coagulation bath. A casting solution with the composition near the binodal curve was more likely to form a membrane with bicontinuous structure because it had more chance to enter the unstable region rapidly or directly [18]. Thus, a precritical casting solution was prepared in this work. Meanwhile, according to the work by Li et al. [33], SPSf had a great compatibility with polyethersulfone (PESU) at the ratio of 16:84. In consideration of PPSU and PESU both belong to sulfone polymers, the same ratio was adopted in this work. At the same time, a low concentration of polymer would be good for the formation of a membrane with a high permeability so 15 wt% would be a good choice for this work. The steps for preparation of such a precritical casting solution were as followed: First, a certain amount of DMAc was added into the flask, and then different weight percentage of water staring from 0% and then increasing by 0.5% at a time was dropped into DMAc. Afterwards, PPSU (12.6 wt%), SPSf (2.4 wt%) and 20 g PVP (20 wt%, calculated by extra method) were dissolved in DMAc (decreasing from 85 wt% by 0.5 wt% a time) and mixed thoroughly under constant stirring for enough time until a homogeneous solution was formed if possible. The water weight percentage of the casting solution which cannot form homogeneous solution was recorded. Finally, the casting solution prior to the cloudy one was defined as precritical casting solution. To further investigate the properties of the above-mentioned polymer solution, the viscosity and the light transmittance were obtained by a rotational rheometer (Physica MCR-301, Austria) and UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, USA). The formation conditions of membranes are presented in Table 1. PPSU and SPSf were dried in vacuum oven at 80 degC for 24h before being used. The polymers and additives were dissolved in DMAc under constant stirring at 70 degC until a homogeneous solution was formed. The solution was allowed to settle and cool to room temperature followed by degassing. The solution then was casted onto a glass plate by hands using a casting knife (Biuged BD201, China) with a gap height of 200 mm and immediately transferred to a programmable humidity and temperature tester (BPS-50CL, China) with the condition of 25 degC and 100% relative humidity (RH) for a period of time (from 0 to 30 s). Both air humidity and exposure time can influence the water adsorption into the membrane. And the adsorbed water in the pristine film from the air essentially influenced the porous structure evolution. Herein we varied the exposure time in 100% humidity to better control the water intrusion into the membrane. After that, the glass plate was immediately taken out and immersed into water coagulation bath maintained at 25 degC until the membrane was peeled off from the glass plate. The resulted membranes were transferred into a fresh deionized water bath at room temperature for 24h, and dried in air before testing and analysis.\n",

      "Paragraph: The preparation of chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) was done based on the literature [28] (Scheme 1). Accordingly, PSf (10 g) was introduced into a flask, which was equipped with a reflux condenser, containing chloroform (500 mL), followed by stirring in order to form a homogenous solution. In the next step, paraformaldehyde (6.79 g) and trimethylchlorosilane (24.7 g) were gradually introduced into the above-mentioned PSf solution. Next, stannic chloride (0.6 mL) was slowly introduced into the as-fabricated mixture solution, followed by heating at 55 degC for 2 days. In the final step, the preparation of CMPSf was done through pouring the as-fabricated mixture solution into a methanol bath, followed via drying at 40 degC for 48 h at a vacuum oven.(Schemes 2 and 3). Fumed Silica (0.5 g) was added into 100 mL of Ethanol/deionized water (9:1) solution under sonication, followed via the addition of 1 mL of APTES under stirring at 60 degC for 24 h so that amino-functionalized silica NPs (NH2-SiO2) can be successfully fabricated. The reaction was carried out under N2 gas in a three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a heating system. In the next step, at 9000 rpm, the prepared suspension was centrifuged for 50 min, followed by re-dispersing the precipitates in ethanol by using an ultrasonic bath. The suspension was consecutively purified with ethanol and water for four times, followed via drying under reduced pressure at 65 degC. Vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) approach was utilized for the synthesis of the mixed matrix membranes. It is well-known that in this approach, membranes can be formed through incorporating of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer dope solution and, subsequently, conducting an evaporation stage before dipping the cast membranes into the coagulation non-solvent bath [13,17,29]. Accordingly, dimethylformamide (as the solvent) and 1,4-dioxane (as the volatile co-solvent) were mixed together at a weight ratio of 3:1 and utilized for the fabrication of the dope solutions. For this purpose, precise amounts of NH2-SiO2 were first introduced into the as-prepared dimethylformamide/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed via sonicating for 60 min in order to produce homogeneous solution mixtures. Then, CMPSf (20 wt% concentration) was introduced into the as-prepared dispersions, followed by entirely dissolving through stirring at 25 degC for 1 day [5]. The NH2-SiO2 loading amounts in the dope solutions varied between 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/g of NH2-SiO2/CMPSf. To fabricate the membranes, the as-prepared homogeneous polymer solution was left overnight to disengage air bubbles before membrane casting and then cast on a glass plate by using a Doctor Blade with a gap of 250 um, then put in a climatic box for 60 s (relative humidity of 65 +- 10% and temperature 40 degC). After the coagulation step, the prepared CMPSf membrane was spontaneously separated from the glass plate through the solvent-nonsolvent exchange. The fabricated membranes were kept in a bath containing DI water for 1 day so that the elimination of the residual solvent can be accomplished, followed via drying at 25 degC. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M1, M2, M3 and M4, classified according to the weight percentage of NH2-SiO2. The neat CMPSf membrane with 0% NH2-SiO2 was also fabricated as the blank membrane and was labelled as M0 (Fig. S1). The compositions utilized for the preparation of the casting solution are exhibited in Table 1.\n"

      "Paragraph: PVC resin (Mw = 81,000 g*mol-1) was obtained from Qilu Petrochemical Company, China. Sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) with different sulfonation degree (SD) of 20% (Mw = 68,000 g*mol-1), 30% (Mw = 65,000 g*mol-1) and 50% (Mw = 63,000 g*mol-1), purchased from Tianjin Yanjin Technology Co. Ltd., China, were used as the membrane additives. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs, Mw = 400, 10 k, 20 k, 35 k, and 100 k Da) and polyethylene oxide (PEO, Mw = 600 k Da) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Reagent Co., USA. PEG 400 was used as the pore-forming agent in the casting solution, and PEG 20 k was used to tune the viscosity of the casting solution. PEGs (Mw = 10 k, 35 k, and 100 k Da) and PEO (Mw = 600 kDa) were used as probe molecules for the determination of the membrane pore size and its distribution. Dimethylacetamide (DMAc, AR, >99.5%) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., China. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, BR, 98%, Mw = 67 k Da, Aladdin Reagent Co., China), sodium alginate (SA, AR, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich Reagent Co., USA) and humic acid (HA, AR, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich Reagent Co., USA) were applied as the simulated organic foulants. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR, 36%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR, >99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Cor., China. All other solvents and reagents were analytical grade. Deionized (DI) water (pH  6.5) was produced from reverse osmosis systems and used in all experiments. Pristine PVC and PVC/SPSF blend membranes were fabricated by NIPS process. The recipes for various casting solutions are listed in Table 1. The detailed fabrication procedure is described as follows. PVC resin and a series of PVC/SPSF blend were first dissolved in DMAc by stirring at 60 degC for 8 h to form homogeneous casting solutions, respectively. Viscosity of the casting solution was measured by Brookfield viscometer (DV2T, Germany) with a shear rate of 100 s-1 at 60 degC. All viscosity data were averaged from three independent measurements, as shown in Table 1. After releasing bubbles under reduced pressure, obtained casting solution was spread onto a neat glass plate via a casting knife with the thickness of 250 um, and then immersed in the coagulation bath (i.e. DI water, 30 degC). Finally, the membrane was rinsed thoroughly with DI water to remove residual solvent and soluble additives, and stored in DI water for subsequent characterization.\n",

Chlorotrimethylsilane and 1,3,5-trioxane were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). 4'-aminobenzo-12-crown-4 (AB12C4) was prepared according to the previous work [35]. All of the other reagents were analytical grade from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China). The chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) was prepared according to the previous work [33,34]. Typically, PSf (18 g) was dissolved in CHCl3 (500 mL). Chlorotrimethylsilane (60 mL), 1,3,5-trioxane (15 g), and SnCl4 (0.6 mL) were added to the PSf solution. The mixture was kept at 50 degC for 18 h with stirring. Once the reaction solution complete, the mixture was poured into ethanol to obtain the cotton-shaped polymer, which is the crude CMPSf. The pure CMPSf product with a degree of substitution (DS, determined by 1H NMR spectrum [36]) of 0.3 is obtained by dissolving and re-precipitating the crude CMPSf multiple times. The CMPSf dense membrane was prepared by the solvent evaporation. CMPSf (4 g) and PEG-4000 (4 g) were dissolved in DMF (18.2 mL). The mixture was stirred at 70 degC for 6 h to obtain a homogeneous casting solution. Then it was put in a vacuum over for 30 min under vacuum to remove bubbles. Subsequently, the casting solution was poured onto a clean glass plate, and it was cast by a blade knife to obtain a thin liquid film with a thickness of 300 mm on the glass. The thin liquid film and the support glass were put into an oven, and were evaporate at 70 degC. Finally, the CMPSf dense membrane was obtained.\n",

BSA, a natural foulant, was provided by Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany. Reactive Green 19 (RG19) dye with a molecular weight of 1419 g mol-1 was purchased from Azar Dye Co., Iran. Deionized water was used as a nonsolvent. For the synthesis of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles, hyperbranched PEI with a molecular weight of 60,000 g mol-1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany. Epoxy silane coupling agent, [3-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-propyl]-trimethoxy silane (EPPTMS), ammonium hydroxide (32%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol, and dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Merck Co., Germany. All chemicals were used as-received. SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using the Stober method (Jouyandeh et al., 2018, 2019). Specifically, 50 mL ethanol was mixed with 3 mL ammonia solution for 10 min. Next, TEOS was added to the solution in the amount of 4 mL, followed by mixing of the solution for 24 h at the ambient temperature. The final synthesized nanoparticles were separated from the mixture by centrifugation (Hettich, Universal 320) at 6000 rpm for 10 min, repeatedly washed with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight. In the first step, silane-modified SiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by mixing 2 g SiO2 and 1.5 mL EPPTMS in 25 mL DMF at 80 degC for 24 h. The resulting nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation, washed with DMF, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight. In the second step, 2 g PEI was dissolved in 50 mL DMF and 2 g silane-modified SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the mixture under continuous stirring for 24 h at 80 degC. The resulting yellowish-color PEI functionalized SiO2 (PEI-SiO2) nanoparticles were finally separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, repeatedly washed with ethanol and DMF solvents, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight. Asymmetric flat-sheet PEI-SiO2/PSF nanocomposite membranes were fabricated using the NIPS method (Amiri et al., 2020). In the first step, membrane casting solutions were prepared by incorporating synthesized PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the amounts of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% based off of the PSF weight in the DMAc solvent under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Next, the suspension was sonicated (Bandelin ultrasonic bath, SONOREX) for 30 min until it was homogenous. After sonication, 1 wt% PVP was dissolved in the PEI-SiO2/DMAc mixture under magnetic stirring for 1 h. Upon completion of mixing, 18 wt% PSF was combined with the prepared mixtures under constant stirring at room temperature for 12 h. The resulting homogenous PSF/PVP/DMAc/PEI-SiO2 membrane casting solutions were next exposed to a temperature of 60 degC for 3 h to eliminate gas bubbles. After slow cooling of the casting solutions at room temperature for 30 min, membranes were cast on very clean and dry glass plates using a 150 mm thick stainless steel home-made casting knife. Finally, the glass plates were immersed in a coagulation bath of deionized water at 25 degC. For comparison purposes, neat PSF and SiO2/PSF membranes were also fabricated using the same procedures as those outlined above. Steps for the fabrication of PEI-SiO2/PSF nanocomposite membranes are illustrated in Fig. 1. Characterization methods of the nanoparticle and the membranes were presented in Supplementary Information.\n"

According to our previously reported work, the sulfobetaine-containing polymer PESSB was synthesized via polycondensation and quaternization. We designed and synthesized a series of copolymers containing diblocks of PESTA and PSF for post-treatment of hydrophilization modification. A facile one-pot method was used to prepare copolymer PSF-PESTA. By varying the molar ratio of diphenol monomers, we were able to prepare PSF-PESTA50 and PSF-PESTA67 containing 50% and 67% tertiary amine groups respectively. The synthetic route of the copolymer is shown in Fig. 3. PSF-PESTA50 and PSF-PESTA67 were converted to PSF-PESSB50 and PSF-PESSB67 by quaternization with sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate (SBES), respectively. The prepared polymers were then characterized by 1H NMR to define the chemical structures. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the peaks (a, a') at d=1.6 corresponds to the methyl groups in bisphenol A in PSF-PESSB50 and PSF-PESSB67, indicating the increases of PSF contents. Meanwhile, the peaks (b, b', b'') at 0.9 ppm corresponds to the methylene group in PESSB block in PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB, which decreased with the decrease of PESSB block.

The obtained membrane was irradiated and the acrylic double bond conversion was measured with ATR-FTIR collected before and after UV irradiation. A conversion of about 41% of acrylic double bonds was achieved after one minute of irradiation under nitrogen (Table 3). The limited acrylic double bond conversion could be attributed to a limited mobility in the PSU membrane (the Tg is around 178degC, in accordance with the data reported in literature for pristine PSU). In order to increase the acrylic double bond conversion, the reverse sequence was applied, involving first the crosslinking reaction and subsequently the phase inversion of the crosslinked matrix. For this purpose, a film of the polymer solution in DMF was cast on a SiC wafer and the curing reaction was monitored via FT-IR analysis, collecting spectra before and after one minute of UV-irradiation.

The HACH 183699 as the test kit reagent for phenol measurement, as well as the pure phenol (C6H5OH, 99%), were obtained from Meditek Sarta, Indonesia. Methanol (CH3OH, 99%), 1,4-benzoquinone (C6H4O2, 99%), and oxalic acid (H2C2O4, 99%) for trapping test experiments were supplied from Merck, Germany. The specimen of petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) used in this study was collected from the refinery plant of PT. Pertamina (persero), Cilacap, Central Java, Indonesia, as the pollutant characteristics are listed in Table 1. Deionized (DI) water was used in all experiments and chemical solution preparation. The sol-gel method was applied with some modifications to synthesize the Co-TiO2 @SiO2 composite [40,41]. Firstly, 50 g of SiO2 was constantly mixed in a 250 mL NaOH 2 M for 2 h at a temperature of 150 degC. After the mixture cooled down, it was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman No. 42) to separate the undissolved SiO2 from the mixture. Then, 2.5 g of TiO2 and 2.5 g of CoCl2 were added to 50 mL of the filtrate solution, and it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed into an ultrasonic homogenizer at a frequency of 50 kHz for 60 min in order to get better particle dispersions. Dilute solution containing HCl 1 M was added dropwise into the mixture under constant stirring until the mixture turned into gels. The gels were left overnight for the compaction process. Subsequently, the spent solution was removed from the gels using a vacuum filter, and the damp gels were dried in an oven at 110 degC for 12 h. The dried gels were calcinated in a furnace at 500 degC for 5 h to remove the remaining organic substances and bonded water molecules, as well as for activating the photocatalysts. Then, it was crushed using a planetary ball mill machine, and the product was sieved to get finer powders. Similar steps were used in synthesizing TiO2 @SiO2 and Co-SiO2 composites. The composite membranes were fabricated by referring to the non-induced phase separation (NIPS) process [42]. Table 2 shows the variation of membrane compositions that were prepared in this study. In the beginning, a certain amount of PSf pellets were mixed into a 50 mL of NMP solvent until the PSf pellets wholly dissolved. Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife. Then, the casted solution was immersed in a DI water bath to form the membrane film, and it was left for 24 h to remove the spent solvent inside the membrane. Finally, membrane films were dried at an ambient condition.\n"

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was dissolved in phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) to be used in the rejection and fouling resistance tests. The casting solutions of five different ratios in weight (ranging from 14% to 18%) were prepared by dissolving varying quantities of PSf-b-PEG in NMP at 60degC. It took several hours to ensure that the PSf-b-PEG was visually dissolved and then the solution of BCP was handled under mechanical stirring at room temperature for 4h so that PSf-b-PEG was completely dissolved in NMP. We kept the casting solutions in vacuum oven overnight to remove air bubbles. Subsequently, the copolymer solution was cast onto a nonwoven with a casting knife to obtain a casting film of 220um thick. The cast film was allowed to stand in air for 10s and then coagulated in DI water at room temperature. The prepared membranes were thoroughly washed with DI water and stored in water for use.

The primary membrane was immediately immersed in the first coagulation bath composed by mixed DI water and DMF in a volume ratio of 2 : 8 for 35 s, then immersed in the pure water bath for at least 30 min to completely finish the precipitation process. Afterwards, the membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h to remove residual solvent and then dried at room temperature for further use. The rough glass substrate was used in the present work for its effect to slow down the phase separation rate. If smooth glass was used, the coagulation bath could invade into the primary membrane from both top surface and bottom surface. For the rough glass case, the much closer interface joint between primary membrane and glass substrate will prevent the invasion of coagulation bath from the bottom surface. As a result, the prolonged phase separation period was helpful to create larger pores in bottom surface for the reason that the sufficient growth of polymer-rich phase and polymer-lean phase. Pristine PSf membranes with different pore structure sizes in bottom surface were also prepared and represented as PSf-PX.\n",

PSF (10.00 g, 22.5 mmol) was dissolved in 500 mL chloroform in a round bottom three-necked flask. Paraformaldehyde (13.40 g, 450 mmol), SnCl4 (0.54 mL, 4.5 mmol), and (CH3)3SiCl (57 mL, 450 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred under mechanical agitation for 12 h. At the end of this period, the solution was filtered with a sand core funnel to remove undissolved reactant, then precipitated in methanol and dried. The as-obtained product was named as chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSF). Secondly, as illustrated in Scheme 1b, CMPSF porous hollow microspheres were prepared via non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) methods. Typically, 1.00 g CMPSF and 0.80 g PEG1000 were dissolved in 50 mL NMP/DCM (1:5, vt %) mixed solvent and stirred for 30 min to obtain the precursor solution. Then, the precursor solution was slowly injected into the 500 mL coagulating bath (0.2% PVA aq). After the solvent dispersed in coagulation bath, a sustained stirring was applied at room temperature (25 degC) for 3 h. After washed with deionized water (DIW) and dried at 60 degC for 3 h, the obtained product was named as porous hollow chloromethylated polysulfone (PH-PSF) microspheres. Eventually, the PH-PSF microspheres were modified with TsN3 and propioic acid for further functionalization (Scheme 1c). The prepared PH-PSF microspheres were dispersed in 100 mL EtOH, and a suspension of PH-PSF was obtained with a concentration of 10 mg mL-1. Then, 0.50 g TsN3 was added into 100 mL PH-PSF/EtOH suspension and reacted for 6 h at 60 degC. Then, the product was washed three times with excess DIW and EtOH. After drying at 50 degC for 3 h, the porous hollow azide polysulfone (PH-NPSF) microspheres were obtained. Subsequently, 0.50 g PH-NPSF, 0.10 g propiolic acid and 0.01 g CuBr were add into 40 mL EtOH/DIW (10:4, vt %) and reacted at room temperature for 6 h under N2 atmosphere. Then, the obtained products were sequentially washed with DIW and EtOH for several times. After drying at 50 degC for 3 h, carboxyl polysulfone porous hollow microspheres were obtained and named as porous hollow carboxyl polysulfone (PH-CPSF) microspheres.\n"

      "Paragraph: Polysulfone (PSf, Udel(r) P-3500, Solvay Comp) was dried at 120 degC under vacuum for 12 h. Sulfuryl chloride, N-butyllithium (2.5 M solution in hexane), piperazine (PIP, Reagent Plus), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) were purchased from sigma-aldrich. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried by calcium hydride for 24 h, and then was distilled and stored into SCHLENK under nitrogen. N-hexane, 2-methoxyethanol (EM), dimethyl formamide (DMF), hydrochloric acid (HCl), glycerol and NaOCl were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The preparation of SC-PSf referred to a previous literature as shown in (Fig. 1)[29]. Typically, PSf (6 g, 13.6 mmol) and 400 ml of THF were added into a four-necked round bottom flask, which was assembled by mechanical stirrer, argon inlet and thermometer. Subsequently, the PSf solution was cooled to -70 degC utilizing dry ice and acetone, and 2.1 equivalents (11.5 ml) of n-butyllithium was added into the flask at -70 degC. The solution was stirred for 1 h at -70 degC before 2.2 equivalents of sulfuryl chloride was added into the flask. Finally, 100 ml of deionized water was added into the solution for quenching active substances. The SC-PSf precipitate was obtained via pouring the polymer solution into i-propanol. The SC-PSf was washed by i-propanol for several times, and then was dried at 50 degC for 24 h under vacuum. Fig. 2 exhibits the hydrolysis of -SOCl2 SC-PSf (4 g) and 60 ml of THF were added into a flask, and the mixture was stirred by magnetic stirring until the solution was clear. Subsequently, 10 ml of deionized water was added into the solution at100 degC. The reaction hold for 2 h at100 degC. Thereafter, the solution was cooled to room temperature and was poured into i-propanol. The precipitate was collected and washed by i-propanol and deionized water for several times. Finally, the polymer was freeze-dried. The hydrolysis degree of SC-PSf could be adjusted by controlling the hydrolysed time. The obtained partially hydrolyzed polymer was labeled as SC(x)-S(y)-PSf, where x and y were the average numbers of sulfonyl chloride and sulphonic acid groups per repeating unit of prepared polymer, respectively. In order to calculate the amount of surplus SO2Cl groups, the THF solution of methylamine was utilized to react with SC-S-PSf (see Fig. 3). Concretely, 0.5 g of SC-S-PSf was dissolved into 10 ml of DMF, and then excessive methylamine was added into the solution. This reaction was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Subsequently, the polymer solution was slowly poured into 2 mol/L of HCl aqueous solution. Through a acidification of 24 h, the polymer was acquired by filtration, and then dialyzed by dialysis bag (MD34, MWCO 500 D) until the conductivity of dialyzate was lower than 10 ms. Finally, the polymer was dried at 80 degC under vacuum for 12 h. Thin film composite (TFC) was prepared by coating method as shown in Fig. 4. The PSf supporting layer was treated by 25% (v/v) glycerol aqueous solution before using. Then, SC-S-PSf and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) with various weight concentrations were dissolved in EM to form clear solution. The solution was filtrated by a 0.22 mm PTFE syringe filter before using. In a typical coating process, the solution was poured onto PSf supporting layer and then evenly shook for 2mins to ensure the uniformity of prepared membrane. Subsequently, the coated membrane was placed into an oven and dried at 60 degC for 4 min. This non-crosslinked membrane was recorded as Muc. After that, a PIP solution in n-hexane (the content of PIP was set at 5% of SC-S-PSf weight in solution) was poured onto membrane surface and kept for 3mins to react with SO2Cl group for preparing crosslinked membrane. Next, the membrane was dried in an oven at 60 degC for 5mins. This membrane crosslinked once was recorded as Mc-1. Repeating above operations twice, a denser membrane which was recorded as Mc-2 could be obtained.\n"

Table 1 gives an overview of the cross-linkers and the photoinitiator used as additives in the casting solutions. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8% VWR BDH Prolabo), tetrahydrofuran (THF, anhydrous, containing 250ppm BHT as inhibitor, >=99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), toluene (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (for HPLC, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), cyclohexanone (>=99%, Sigma-Aldrich), butyl acetate (>=99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethyl acetate (EtOAc, anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), xylenes mixture (ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich), propan-2-ol (IPA, 99.5%, VWR BDH Prolabo), and glycerol (99.5% VWR BDH Prolabo) were all used without further purification. The dye 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2',4',5',7'-tetraiodofluorescein sodium salt (Rose Bengal B (RB), 1017.64gmol-1) was provided by Fluka (Switzerland). A glass plate was applied as the casting substrate to prepare the membranes. The synthesis of UV cured PSU based membranes was performed according to the scheme in Fig. 1. First, the casting solution was prepared, followed by membrane wet casting and finally UV irradiation to obtain a UV modified asymmetric PSU membrane. The detailed fabrication is described below. Asymmetric PSU based membranes were prepared via NIPS. A viscous solution containing 21wt% of PSU in DMF was stirred at 80degC for 3h. Subsequently, the solution was cooled down, and 5wt% of cross-linker, 3wt% of TPO, and THF (with a constant 85/15 DMF/THF ratio) were added and stirred. The compositions of the different casting solutions used are shown in Table 2. After obtaining a homogeneous solution, membranes with variable wet thicknesses of 50, 100, 150, or 200um were cast at a speed of 1.8mmin-1 using an automated casting knife (Braive Instruments, Belgium) [38]. Prior to an immersion into the coagulation bath containing deionized water, the membrane was exposed to air for 30s in order to evaporate the THF and thus create a thin selective layer at the surface of the film. During the casting, the air temperature was 20+-3degC, while the relative humidity was 40+-10%. The PSU membrane cross-linking was performed via UV curing. The UV curable membrane samples were transported through a UV curing unit (Fusion Systems, Inc., USA) at a line speed of 10mmin-1, which was equipped with a D-bulb located above the conveyor belt. The main irradiation light was UVA (320-390nm). The final dose of energy to cure the membranes was 12.3Jcm-2.\n"

The ultrasonic signal time-shifting in time-domain obtained from the PES/DMAc and SPSf/DMAc casting solution during the phase inversion process correlated to the formation rate of membrane as illustrated in Fig. 4. The polymer concentration in the two kinds of casting solutions kept at the same (28 wt %). Time-shifting is described as the time differential between the initial immersion time of the polymer solution and a particular time during membrane formation. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that the ultrasonic signals time-shifting of PES/DMAc casting solution raised sharply at the initial time of 30 s, then progressively attained a steady value at 93 ns after 50 s in the membrane formation process. The quick ultrasonic signal time-shifting was related to the rapid diffusional exchange between water and DMAc. Obviously, the ultrasonic signal time-shifting decelerated for the SPSf/DMAc casting solution, which exhibited a steady value of 37 ns after 50 s. It demonstrated that the diffusional exchange rate achieved from SPSf/DMAc casting solution was slower than that obtained from PES/DMAc casting solution, which displayed a slower phase inversion rate.

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, >= 99.8 %) and dodecane (>= 99 %) were purchased from Honeywell. All chemicals were used as purchased without further purification. GO nanoparticles were synthesized via a modified Hummers method that was previously reported [43]. In brief, a mixture of 24 mL of H2SO4 and 6 mL of H3PO4 was stirred in an ice bath for several minutes. 1 g of Gr flakes and 3 g of KMnO4 were then added into mixing solution under the same conditions. The reactants were then stirred at 95 +- 2 degC in an oil bath for 30 min followed by the addition of 50 mL deionized water (DI) and stirring for another 30 min at the same conditions. The reaction was then terminated by adding DI (150 mL) and H2O2 (20 mL). The mixture was then diluted with HCl (20 %) and centrifuged, followed by several washing/centrifugation cycles with DI until obtaining a neutral pH. GO nanoparticles were then obtained by drying the samples overnight at 80 degC. The dried GO nanoparticles were then aminated with DDA using the temperature-assisted solution interaction technique [23]. In brief, 100 mg of GO were dispersed in DI (50 mL) and 300 mg of DDA were dispersed in ethanol (50 mL) and both solutions were then ultrasonicated for 1 h. Both GO and DDA suspensions were mixed in a round bottom flask and stirred in an oil bath (60 degC, 48 h) under the reflux conditions. The aminated GO (rGO-DDA) nanoparticles were then obtained by the solvent evaporation technique followed by several washings with ethanol followed by vacuum drying at 85 degC overnight. A schematic representation of the GO synthesis, the amination reaction with DDA and the anticipated structure of rGO-DDA is presented in Fig. 1. Bare PSF, PSF/GO and PSF/rGO-DDA mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared using the well-known non-solvent induced phase separation method [44]. In brief, PSF (17 wt.%) in NMP was used as the main casting solution with 3 wt.% PVP as the pore former. For the preparation of PSF/GO and PSF/rGO-DDA casting solutions, two stock dispersions (0.5 mg/mL) of the pristine GO and rGO-DDA in NMP were prepared and sonicated for 2 h. Different loadings of GO and rGO-DDA were then added to NMP according to Table 1. PSF and PVP were then slowly added to the dispersions and stirred vigorously for 2 h followed by slow stirring overnight until homogenous solutions were obtained (Figure S1 in the supplementary information). The obtained solutions were then casted on a clean glass plate at a uniform speed using an automated casting machine equipped with a film applicator (Elcometer (r), UK). The casted solutions were then soaked into a coagulant bath (DI) where the phase inversion took place and the membrane detached freely from the glass plate. The obtained membranes were then washed and kept in DI for until testing. Fig. 2 illustrates the phase inversion technique for the fabrication of membranes studied in this work. The compositions and codes of the prepared membranes are presented in Table 1.\n"

To investigate the influence of substrate, the PES UF membranes with different MWCO was used, and the resultant NFMs was named as NM@UF10K, NM@UF20K, NM@UF50K, respectively. Control sample was prepared from the PES-10K UF membrane without adding SPSF nanoparticles.\n",

      "Paragraph: Polysulfone (PSF, Solvay P3500 LCD) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3, Aladdin) were dried overnight in vacuum oven prior to use. Bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone (DCDPS, 98%, Aladdin) was recrystallized twice from hot toluene (DCDPS: toluene = 1:1.1 (weight ratio)) prior to use. Bisphenol-A (BPA, 99%, Aladdin) was recrystallized twice from hot toluene (BPA: toluene = 1:5.3 (weight ratio)). And the crystals were dried in vacuum oven at 125 degC all day. S-1-dodecyl-S'-(a,a'-dimethyl-a''-acetic acid) trithiocarbonate (DDMAT) was synthesized according to the literature (Lai et al., 2002). 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), dichloromethane (DCM), 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP), 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), toluene, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, >99.5%), palladium(II) chloride, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, potassium hexachloroplatinate, copper(II) chloride and nickel (II) chloride were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). 4-vinylpyridine was distilled under reduced pressure or passed through basic alumina column to remove the inhibitor before being used, and AIBN was recrystallized from ethanol. Dihydroxy-terminated polysulfone (HO-PSF-OH) was prepared in a typical process that via nucleophilic condensation reaction between DCDPS and BPA based on the reported literatures (Xie et al., 2016). The synthesis is briefly summed up as follows: DCDPS (43.8 mmol), BPA (42.5 mmol) and K2CO3 (13.2 mmol) were dissolved into a NMP and toluene mixed solution (v/v = 3/1) of 60 mL, which was placed in a three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a Dean-Stark trap, a condenser, a gas inlet/outlet and a mechanical stirrer. After 30 min nitrogen charging, the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, and then gradually heated to 152 degC for 8 h under reflux. The water produced by the reaction was removed completely by azeotropic distillation with toluene. Then, the reaction mixture was heated to 175 degC, and started the polymerization for 8 h. After that, the reaction was exposed to air for stopping the reaction, and then cooled to room temperature. The reacted mixture was precipitated into a HCl/methanol aqueous solution (v/v = 2/1) with fully stirring, and then filtrated. Further, the obtained polymer was dissolved in THF, and subsequently re-precipitated into the HCl/methanol aqueous solution for three times. After filtration, the polymer was washed with water at 80 degC for 4 h. Finally, it was dried in a vacuum oven at 90 degC for 24 h to obtain the HO-PSF-OH. HO-PSF-OH (0.625 mmol), DDMAT (1.92 mmol), DMAP (0.18 mmol) and DCM (75 mL) were added into a 150 mL round bottom flask equipped with a condenser, a magnetic stirrer and a gas inlet/outlet. After purging with nitrogen for 3 h at 0 degC, DCC (1.92 mmol), which was dispersed in a small amount of DCM, was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. Then, the reaction mixture was raised to room temperature and started reaction for 72 h under stirring. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst DMAP and the dicyclohexylurea (from DCC), and concentrated by the rotary evaporation. Then, the mixture was precipitated into methanol and filtered. Further, the obtained polymer was dissolved in DCM and re-precipitated to methanol for three times. After filtration, the polymer was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 degC for 24 h to obtain the DDMAT-terminated polysulfone (DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT), and used as the macromolecular chain transfer agent. A dry Schlenk flask equipped with magnetic stirrer was charged with AIBN (0.02 mmol), DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT (0.1 mmol), 4-VP (40 mmol) and DMAc (10 mL). The Schlenk flask was degassed with three times of freeze-pump-thaw cycles, sealed off under nitrogencondition. The RAFT polymerization was performed in an oil bath at 80 degC for 24 h. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, it was precipitated into deionized water. The filtered polymer was re-dissolved to DMAc and re-precipitated into deionized water for twice. Finally, the polymer was washed with methanol, and then dried at 60 degC for 24 h to obtain the amphiphilic triblock copolymer poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-polysulfone-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP-PSF-P4VP) according to the mole ratio of [AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:2000. The polymers according to other two ratios ([AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:500/1000) were also synthesized in the same steps. The P4VP-PSF-P4VPs synthesized with [AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:500/1000/2000 were named as BCP1, BCP2 and BCP3, respectively, and their synthesis condition and characteristics are listed in Table 1. P4VP-PSF-P4VP/PSF blend membranes were prepared via the SNIPS process, and the schematic illustration for SNIPS process and the surface-segregation of P4VP-PSF-P4VP are shown in Scheme 1. The hydrophilic segment P4VP was segregated gradually towards the membrane surface and pore walls due to the interaction between water and the hydrophilic segment as the contact time increased in the coagulation bath. At the same time, the P4VP-PSF-PSF self-assembled in the bulk and the solvent. According to the ratio set in the Table 2, the casting solutions were prepared by blending polysulfone and P4VP-PSF-P4VP, which were dissolved in DMAc under mechanical stirring at room temperature for 24 h. In order to remove the bubbles, the casting solutions were stood at room temperature for 24 h until the bubbles were exhausted. All casting solutions were cast uniformly in a clean glass plate by a cast knife with a knife gap of 250 mm, and then immediately immersed into the deionized water at room temperature. The obtained membranes were transferred into a new deionized water bath for 24 h to complete the phase inversion and remove the residual solvent. The as-prepared membranes were stored in deionized water bath before use.\n"

Therefore, a kinetic study of polymer dissolution in different solvents is conducted after preparation. The polymer dissolution is studied in a high-pressure reactor (4540-600 mL, Parr Instrument, Moline, Illinois, United States). The reactor is equipped with a four-blade impeller.

To study the scale up of the membranes prepared using eco-friendly solvents, an aluminum doctor blade (AP-G10/10, Paul N. Gardner company, Florida, United States) is used to cast membranes in laboratory scale and an aluminum slot die is used to fabricate the membranes in a production scale, to understand the viability of scaling up the fabrication process. The dope solutions containing the three solvents in both casting scales are shown in Table 1. When the doctor blade method is used, the gap between the blade and the glass plate was set at 200 mm. In the slot die casting method, the slot gap is set at 90 mm, and the coating gap is set at 200 mm above the glass plate substrate, which is placed on top of the poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film. The PET film is the moving conveyor that is pulled at a speed of 1.3 mm/s from a feed roller to the take-up roller [30]. A syringe pump is used to set the flow rate of the dope solution dispensed from the slot die to fabricate defect free membranes. For each batch, approximately 80 mL of dope solution is filled in the syringe. A different 2D flow rate is used for each dope solution, for PSf/DMAc, 0.17 mm2/s is used; for PSf/PolarClean, 0.75 mm2/s is used, and 0.70 mm2/s is used for PSf/50%PolarClean-50%GVL. The different 2D flow rates are used due to the different properties of these dope solutions. All casting is performed at 25 degC and 48% humidity. The glass substrates are cleaned with DI water and are then rinsed using isopropyl alcohol to guarantee no residual water on the surface before casting. After casting, the liquid films are inversed into a solid film via the NIPS method. Membranes pieces are then cast in the shape of 305 x 100 mm x mm (length x width).\n",

Cuprous iodide (CuI) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) were purchased from Sinooharm Chemical Reagent Co. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used as the only component of the nonsolvent in the coagulation bath and for all the aqueous solutions. The synthesis of CuI superstructure nanosheets followed a process similar to our previous report [26]. Commercial CuI powder was first dissolved in acetonitrile by ultrasonication until transparent solution was formed with a concentration of 20 g/L (CuI-acetonitrile adducts solution). Subsequently, 30 mL of PVP aqueous solution (30 g/L) was injected into 10 mL of CuI-acetonitrile adducts solution through a syringe under vigorous magnetic stirring (800 rpm). After stirring for 1 h, the gradually formed white precipitates were collected by the removal of supernatant, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at room temperature. Asymmetric PSf/CuI superstructure nanosheets membranes were prepared by the NIPS process. For preparing the casting solution, PSf (16 wt%) and PEG (8 wt%) were first dissolved in DMAc (76 wt%) by vigorously stirring at 300 rpm for 12 h under 70 degC. Then different amounts of the prepared CuI superstructure nanosheets (0, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 wt% based on the overall mass of the casting solution) were added into the polymer solution and mechanically stirred for 2 h to form a homogeneous solution. Finally, the solution was degassed under vacuum at 50 degC for 2 h. The resultant solution was cast onto a nonwoven fabric with a casting knife to obtain a casting film. Then the supported film was coagulated in deionized water at room temperature. The solidified PSf/CuI superstructure nanosheets membranes were thoroughly washed with water to remove the residual DMAc. The prepared MMMs with different loading contents of the CuI superstructure nanosheets (0, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 wt% based on the casting solution) are denoted as PSf, PSf/s-CuI 0.5%, PSf/s-CuI 0.8% and PSf/s-CuI 1.0%, respectively. In addition, we annealed CuI superstructure nanosheets in air in a muffle furnace for 1 h at 280 degC and 350 degC, respectively, for partly and completely converting CuI to CuO. The resulting products were also used as fillers (0.8 wt% based on the casting solution) for preparing the MMMs according to the same method mentioned above.

      "Paragraph: A series of allyl polysulfone-graft-poly(dopamine methacrylamide) membranes (AP-DM# membranes, where # is the weight ratio of DMA to APSf) were prepared by an in situ process composed of grafting-through polymerization followed by a non-solvent induced phase separation method [28,29]. For the preparation of AP-DM1 membrane, APSf (1.00 g), AIBN (0.10 g), PSf (1.00 g), and DMA (1.00 g) were dissolved in 10.3 mL of NMP in a 100 mL dried Schlenk flask containing a magnetic stir bar. PSf is the commercial polysulfone, and it was intentionally used to increase the stability of the membrane. The flask was sealed with a septum and deoxygenated with nitrogen for 1 h. The flask was then placed in an 80 degC oil bath, and stirred with a magnetic stir bar for 6 h for the polymerization of the vinyl groups in APSf and DMA resulting in a clear brown solution. After the polymerization, the resulting solution was left in sonication at degassing mode for 2 h to remove the air bubbles trapped within the solution, followed by casting on a non-woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric using a doctor blade at a thickness of 200 mm, and then immersed into DI water bath at room temperature. After 24 h, the resulting membrane was rinsed thoroughly for 24 h with 0.25 M of NaOH solution to remove the solvent and any remaining DMA and poly(dopamine methacrylamide) (PDMA) produced by homo-polymerization. The resulting membrane was designated as AP-DM1 membrane, where the number 1 indicates the weight ratio of DMA to APSf. Other AP-DM# membranes such as AP-DM0.6 and AP-DM0.8 membranes were prepared using the same procedure except the amount of DMA as listed in Table 1. An antimicrobial peptide, nisin, was immobilized onto the surface of AP-DM# membranes by the reaction between N-terminal NH2 group of nisin and catechol group of DMA moiety in the membrane. 1.0 and 5.0 g/L of nisin solutions were prepared using 40 and 200 g of nisin powder, respectively, and 1L of phosphate buffer solutions with pH value of 7.4 [20]. Since the content of active ingredient in nisin is about 2.5%, 40 and 200 g of nisin powder were used to prepare the 1.0 and 5.0 g/L solutions, respectively, and any insoluble components in the solutions were removed by vacuum filtration. In order to immobilize the nisin, the AP-DM# membranes were immersed in the nisin solution for 6 h at room temperature, and then they were rinsed with the phosphate buffer. The rinsed membranes were finally immersed in DI water bath at room temperature for 24 h, and then stored in DI water in the refrigerator. The membranes were named as AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes, in accordance with the concentrations of nisin active ingredient of 1.0 and 5.0 g/L, respectively (Table 1). The content of nisin in the AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes was estimated by calculating the bonding density using Eq. (1), as follows:(1)Bondingdensity(%)=Wmemb,t-Wmemb,t0Amembx100\n"

      "Paragraph: A series of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes consisting of allyl polysulfone-graft-poly(dopamine methacrylamide) (AP-DM# membranes, where # indicates the feed ratio of APSf to dopamine methacrylamide (DMA)) were fabricated through the following four steps (Scheme 2(a)): (1) preparing dope solutions for the polymerization of APSf and DMA containing vinyl moieties (grafting-through), (2) casting the resulting solutions onto the PET non-woven fabric, (3) immersing the casted films for 24 h in a DI water bath for the formation of membranes by a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method, and (4) immersing the membranes for 24 h in 0.25 M of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution. A clear and homogeneous solution containing allyl polysulfone-graft-poly(dopamine methacrylamide), in which poly(dopamine methacrylamide) (PDMA) brushes are grafted onto APSf, can be prepared from step (1) [33,34]. Commercial polysulfone (PSf) was included in the reaction mixture to improve the physical strength of the membranes. When the membranes were prepared without PSf, only weak and fragile membranes were obtained due to the poor mechanical property of APSf caused by the small molecular weight (Fig. S3) [35,36]. Meanwhile, in the preparation process of the bare PSf membrane, more dilute casting solution was used than that used for the preparation of AP-DM# membranes, because commercial PSf has larger molecular weight than APSf (50,000 and 5,300 g/mol are the Mn values for polysulfone and APSf, respectively). We could not handle the PSf solutions of 0.7 mM and/or higher concentration to fabricate the PSf membranes because they are too viscous.\n",

Under low pressure, the homogeneous hot solution was de-aerated to allow the complete release of air bubbles. Then the casting solution was spread on a hot stainless steel plate (temperature 160 degC) by a casting bar having a gap of 200 mm. Thereafter, the plate was cooled in a water bath at room temperature (25 degC) until the flat membrane formed.

Then the polymerization was carried out at 80degC for 12h with stirring and N2 atmosphere, and stopped by quenching in ice water. Subsequently, acetic acid solution (1mL) was added into the obtained solution under stirring for 2h to improve the hydrolysis of the ethoxysilyl groups (SiOC2H5) and subsequent condensation of the silanol groups (SiOH). After being vacuum degassed, the casting solution was spread onto a glass plate and immersed into a water bath at 30degC for liquid-liquid phase separation. Then the solid membrane was immersed in distilled water at 80degC for 24h to thoroughly remove unreacted monomers and solvent, and further improve the cross-linking polymerization.
