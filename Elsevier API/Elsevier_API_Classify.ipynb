       "['Versatile, facile, easy, and economical, these are the advantages that immersion precipitation or non-solvent phase separation (NIPS) offers [1–3]. Due to these, NIPS process has been regarded as the most widely-used approach in fabricating flat sheet membranes from a variety of polymers [4]. In addition, NIPS can provide a wide-range of pore size: from microfiltration to nanofiltration [5]. In this process, a polymer of choice is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Once homogeneous, the polymeric solution is cast onto a support and phase-inversion is prompted through direct immersion in a coagulation bath/non-solvent bath (typically water), generating a polymer rich phase that transforms into the membrane matrix after polymer precipitation, and a polymer lean phase which develops into pores after demixing [6].',\n",
       " 'Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is amongst the most extensively used commercial membranes due to its favorable attributes such as high glass transition temperature (Tg\\xa0=\\xa0190\\xa0°C), high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance over a wide-range of pH, good thermal resistance, exceptional biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication [7–9]. PSf membranes are commonly used in wastewater treatment [10–14], hemodialysis [15–17], protein purification [18–22], food processing [23], and so on. Polar solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [1,24–27], N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [9,28–31], and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) [32–35] are usually used to dissolved PSf polymers. Utilizing these solvents to prepare PSf membranes via NIPS process generally leads to formation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with relatively dense surface structure and porous sub-structure. Meanwhile, the cross-section of these membranes is composed of large macrovoids with walls having cellular-like structure [36] which could generate low flux due to the closed-pore structure (the pores are not interconnected with each other) that could potentially slow down the flow of water across the membrane. Additionally, concerns have been expressed on the use of such solvents to prepare polymeric membranes due to their toxicity which can cause adverse effects to our health. Besides, during NIPS process, these solvents are released into the coagulation bath during the membrane formation, and residual solvents are further extracted in the washing bath. These constitute to the release of 20–50 billion liters of contaminated water annually [1,37], and if not properly treated, can create immense damages to the environment. Hence, the use of these solvents in industries are now strictly regulated. In May 2020, the European Union has imposed a mandate on the use of NMP which has led researchers to find “greener” and more sustainable solvents [24,37] that have high affinity towards the PSf polymer. Alongside the prospect of tuning the morphology and suppressing macrovoids using alternative solvents.',\n",
       " 'As a result of the raising interest to improve the sustainability of PSf membrane production, several different solvents have been investigated in the past with respect to their suitability for replacing harmful solvents. In recent studies conducted by Kahrs and Schwellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42] the use of utilizing 2-pyrrolidone (2P) solvent as a substitute for NMP was explored. 2P is an organic compound derived from γ-butyrolactone with considerable similarities with NMP as shown in Table 1. To date, there are no known life-threatening risks accompanied by using 2P, making it a potential alternative for NMP.',\n",
       " \"Standard NIPS process yield skinned asymmetric membranes with large macrovoids that could either have closed pore (cellular) structure or interconnected open pore (bi-continuous structure) [39,43]. Macrovoids are defects that grow perpendicular or near perpendicular to the skin or top layer [44]. They are large in size, and have elongated or teardrop-shaped pores ranging from 10 to 50\\xa0μm [45]. The presence of these large macrovoids can weaken the structural integrity of the membranes which can lead to breakage and total failure during operation [46]. Since the first development of phase-inversion process by Leob and Sourirajan in the 1960's [47], macrovoid formation have confounded researchers which has led to the development of different studies to understand macrovoid formation [39,44,48]. Numerous models were proposed for the formation of macrovoids. Early on, Reuvers and Smolders suggested that macrovoids were formed as the result of the nucleation of the polymer poor phase [49]. Strathmann et al. explained that the macrovoid was initiated by the rupture of the polymeric skin caused by shrinkage stress-induced-syneresis [50]. Other researchers considered that macrovoid formation stemmed from the thermodynamics aspects of chemical potential gradient [43,51–53]. Additional theories include Marangoni effects [54], solutocapillary convection mechanism [55–57], osmotic pressure [58] and combination of different mechanisms [59]. Nonetheless, several methods have been investigated to reduce macrovoid formation during immersion precipitation due to their weak mechanical strength. These include (i) choosing a solvent and non-solvent pair with low affinity towards each other; (ii) increasing the viscosity of the casting solution by increasing the polymer concentration or adding additives; and (iii) adding solvent to the coagulation bath [39,43,60–62].\",\n",
       " 'Although adding solvent to the coagulation bath seem to be the easiest option however, this could lead to increased production costs and pollution. The addition of additives has been the most explored strategies to mitigate the growth of macrovoids, and adding amounts of hydrophilic polymers such polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most predominant [63–65]. Some studies revealed that the addition of these hydrophilic polymers can enlarge the size of the macrovoids, while other studies reported the opposite as highlighted in the study by Sadrzadeh and Bhattacharjee [64]. These inconsistencies could be due to the fact that PVP and PEG are originally utilized as pore formers for polymeric membranes. They form pores as they leach out of the cast film upon immersion in the coagulation bath. However, depending on the molecular weights of the PVP and PEG [64], some can get trapped in the polymeric matrix. Therefore, the molecular weights of these materials have to be taken into great considerations before being used to suppress macrovoids. On the other hand, other researchers have used non-solvents such as water [24,38,39,66], ethanol [65] and other organic solvents [66,67] to control the exchange rates of the solvent and coagulant. Among these, water appear to be the most logical option due to its accessibility, abundancy, low-cost, and non-toxicity.',\n",
       " 'As of this writing, there are only 4 published works on PSf/2P system. Mousavi and colleagues intensively worked on the dynamics of using 2P as a sole solvent for PSf, and a co-solvent, and how the rheology of these conditions contributed to the resulting cross-section structure of PSf membranes [41,42]. Since standard NIPS process produce ultrafiltration PSf membrane, Wang et al. in their earlier work [40], explored the use of vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process to obtain PSf membranes with highly porous surface and cross-section. Recently, Wang and colleagues observed the macrovoid initiation position in PSf/2P system prepared by NIPS process [39]. These previous works have provided initial understanding on the solvency of PSf in 2P, and on how the viscoelasticity of the casting solution affects the cross-section of PSf membranes. It is important to note that, except for the work on PSf/2P using VIPS process, the other studies only focused on the morphology of the cross-section of PSf membranes, specifically on the growth of macrovoids.',\n",
       " 'This study encompasses two major objectives: (i) fabrication of highly porous PSf membranes through NIPS process using 2P as the solvent, and (ii) the suppression of macrovoid growth by using water as a non-solvent additive in the PSf/2P casting solution. Although, other studies [38,39] have previously explored the feasibility of this concept, they have not fully determined the amount of water that can be added to achieve macrovoid-free PSf membranes. Moreover, in this study, in-depth evaluations of the physical properties such morphology, porosity, pore size, permeability, and mechanical property of the PSf membranes with respect to the concentration of the additive are thoroughly carried out. Fig. 1 shows the three major parts of this study. The first part, heavily revolves on trying to understand how the nature of solvency of 2P affects the morphology of the PSf membranes, and its viability as a replacement for NMP solvent. Next, once the fundamental concepts of 2P/PSf system are established, the use of water as an additive in the casting solution to suppress macrovoids is examined. Herein, we shall probe into the viscosity of the solution, study the ternary diagram, and investigate the kinetics that took place during phase-inversion. In addition, comprehensive analysis of the physical properties of the membranes such as porosity, pore size, morphology, permeability, and mechanical properties will be examined. Lastly, the potential application of this concept will also be extended to other systems such as PSf/NMP, PSf/DMAc, and PSf/DMF to test the practicality of using water to suppress macrovoids.',\n",

       " 'Among the different mathematical models used to describe the thermodynamics of ternary systems, Flory-Huggins theory is the most sought after due to its relatively simple mathematical model and good accuracy of the phase behavior [72,73]. It is important to note that by constructing the ternary thermodynamics phase diagram of the phase-inversion process, we can get an insight into the composition paths of the demixed system. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (Table 3) of the systems can be estimated using the solubility parameters from Table 2, and their relationship can be transcribed to equation (3a) [73]:(3a)χi3=V1RT(δ1−δ2)2i=1,2where χi3 is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, V1 is the pure molar volume for component 1, and δ1 is the solubility parameter for component i. Later, Hansen introduced a correction factor, α:(4)χi3=αV1RT[(δ1,d−δ2,d)2+0.25(δ1,p−δ2,p)2+0.25(δ1,h−δ2,h)2i=1,2',\n",
       " \"Fig. 2 illustrates the ternary diagrams of (a) PSf/NMP//water and (b) PSf/2P/water. The binary interaction parameters (χ) such as PSf–2P, PSf–water, and 2P–water used in this study were similar to that of Wang's group [40]. In their work, they used the same values of χNMP–water for χ2P–water. According to their calculations (with the data of excess Gibbs free energy reported from Ref. [75]), the values of χNMP–water and χ2P–water at 40\\xa0°C are close hence, they assumed that they are also close at 25\\xa0°C. They further verified this by measuring the water compositions in the 2P/water and NMP/water when they are in equilibrium with water vapor in the humid air (25\\xa0°C, 70% relative humidity) which showed similar values of both binary interactions. Although the similarity between NMP and 2P (Table 1) is quite intriguing in spite of the increased hydrogen bonding of 2P, it was indicated by Aparicio et al. [76], that 2P supposedly favors forming cyclic dimer due to the inter-molecule hydrogen bonding. Instead of forming hydrogen bond with water, it forms a cyclic dimer that weakens its affinity towards water.\",\n",
       " 'In addition, the solvent-polymer interaction (χPSf-2P and χPSf-NMP) also provides a quantitative information on the degree of interaction of polymer and solvent. According to literature [72], if χpolymer-solvent is less than 0.5, the solvent has high affinity towards the polymer, and is considered a good solvent. Conversely, if it is higher than 0.5, it is regarded as a poor solvent. As shown in Tables 2 and 2P is a poorer solvent than NMP therefore, the homogeneous region of PSf/2P/water phase diagram is narrower than PSf/NMP/water. This indicates that it would take less amount of non-solvent (water) to induce demixing in PSf/2P system. The cloud points in\\xa0Fig. 2\\xa0denoted the amount of water needed to demix the system. For PSf/2P system, it takes about 2\\xa0wt% of water to phase separate the solution, and as the amount of PSf in the solution is increased, it takes a lesser amount of non-solvent to induce phase-inversion. With this knowledge, we can identify how much non-solvent additive we can add into the casting solution without causing phase-inversion. Another key parameter that must be considered is the relative energy difference (RED) which provides information on whether the parameters of the two molecules (usually a polymer and solvent) are within range. This can be measured according to the following equations [2,77,78]:(5)Ro=(δD2+δP2)0.5−δH(6)Ra2=4(δD,P−δD,S)2+(δP,P−δP,S)2+(δH,P−δH,S)2(7)RED=RaRo',\n",

The calculated RED of the systems are 0.72, and 0.69 for PSf/2P and PSf/NMP, respectively. Hence, we can confirm that PSf polymer is soluble in 2P, and be can be used as a “greener” solvent replacement for NMP.',\n",

Left-hand figure displays the surface and cross-section morphology of the PSf membrane when NMP was used as a solvent, while the right-hand figure represents the PSf/2P system. Starting with the PSf/NMP system, a dense surface structure was obtained which is consistent with other published works [1,24–27] while, a skinned asymmetric membrane with large finger-like macrovoids extending from the top part to the bottom part of the membranes with walls having cellular-like structure was obtained. In contrast, when 2P was used as a solvent, the surface structure of the PSf membranes have obvious large pores in the microfiltration (MF) range (to be confirmed in sections 3.2 and 3.3). Meanwhile, it appears that the macrovoids were found at the deeper part of the membrane. Zoomed-in images of the membrane reveal that instead of cellular-like structure, 2P solvent generated interconnected pores or bi-continuous structure which is in agreement with the previous studies by Wang et al. [39,40] when 2P is used as a solvent.',\n",
       " 'Although there are numerous studies tackling phase-inversion of casting solution to form membranes, the concept governing demixing is still tricky to understand. Many studies have suggested that if a solvent has a high affinity or high miscibility with the non-solvent, instantaneous demixing would occur. In other words, the fast exchange between the solvent and non-solvent induces the rapid precipitation of the polymer and formation of the film, within seconds of immersion in the coagulation or non-solvent bath. With this type of demixing, a highly porous cross-section (finger-like macrovoids) is obtained. On the other hand, if the solvent has a low affinity towards the non-solvent, a slow exchange occurs, which decelerates the formation of the film. Membranes with relatively dense top layer and sponge-like substructure are achieved during delayed demixing [4]. However, other studies suggest that instantaneous demixing can help mitigate the formation of macrovoids [79]. With these ambiguities in membrane formation, Hong et al. [39] studied the demixing that transpires during phase separation process.',\n",
       " 'A homogeneous casting solution can be demixed through nucleation and growth (NG) or spinodal decomposition (SD) depending on the solution composition at which the phase separation occurs [80]. For the demixing to occur via NG, the phase separation composition must lie on the meta-stable or binodal region. Conversely, for SD to happen, the composition path must be found in the unstable or spinodal region. When phase-inversion happens via NG, the resulting morphology consists of nuclei of polymer-poor phase that can grow into macrovoids. Meanwhile, when phase-inversion occurs via SD, the subsequent morphology contains continuous polymer-poor phase but not nuclei type. If the demixing is accompanied by fast solvent and non-solvent exchange, the phase-inversion would typically be via SD, as evidenced by the formation of bi-continuous structure [39].',\n",
       " 'It was previously stated that NMP has a high affinity towards water hence, one would assume that the exchange of solvent and non-solvent is fast enough to cause SD demixing. However, this claim contradicts our observations in Fig. 3, as cellular-like structures are observed instead of bi-continuous morphology. Meanwhile, 2P has a low miscibility towards water (possible cyclic dimer), so it is expected that phase-inversion would transpire via NG, and poorly interconnected pores on the walls of the macrovoids are to be anticipated. However, the opposite was found on both membranes. To find out why such phenomena were observed, we evaluated the viscosity of both systems as illustrated at the bottom images of Fig. 3. Due to the poorer solvency of PSf in 2P, higher viscosity is attained. For the same concentration (15\\xa0wt%), PSf/2P system has 41% higher viscosity than PSf/NMP system. This suggest that the high viscosity of PSf/2P system slowed down the solvent and non-solvent exchange which helped maintain the open porous structure and interconnected pores by mitigating the coarsening process. Conversely, NMP is a good solvent for PSf. Its high affinity for water permitted fast solvent and non-solvent exchanges, while the low viscosity (553\\xa0cP) of the system could not prevent coarsening during the phase-inversion process. So, phase-inversion may occur by SD, but the structure is not fixed and can still evolve after phase-separation. As a result, large macrovoids were observed across the membrane with cellular-like structure.',\n",
       " 'As stated previously, earlier works did not explore the effect of 2P on the surface morphology of PSf membranes via NIPS process. In this study, we found out that by using 2P as solvent, we could easily obtain PSf membranes in the MF range. Normally, NIPS process generates ultrafiltration membranes as a result of the fast solvent and non-solvent exchange that transpires in the coagulation bath which typically results in the formation of a relatively dense top surface also known as skin layer [49,81–84]. Based on the study conducted by Strathmann, asymmetric morphology arises from the steep concentration, and activity gradient of the polymer, solvent and non-solvent. If the affinity of the solvent and non-solvent towards each other is high, as soon as the water is introduced on the surface of the film, the resulting chemical composition at the interface reaches in a short time a value indicating a phase separation has occurred, due to the fast mass transfer kinetics between the solvent and non-solvent. Where in fact, the internal of the film is still very far below the binodal point [85,86]. In order to slow down the exchange at the interface, additives can be introduced into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. That is why researchers commonly incorporate additives such as PEG or PVP to obtain PSf MF. To obtain PSf MF membranes, additives such PEG or PVP are added into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. However, even without additives, PSf/2P system is viscous enough (compared to PSf/NMP) to allow slower mass transfer kinetics during phase-inversion which permitted the formation of porous surface structure as shown in Fig. 4. But it is important to note that the amount of solid content would also influence the viscosity of the solution which could decrease the porosity of the membrane. Hence, it is evident in Fig. 4 that the surface porosity decreases with the polysulfone content (which will be verified later by dedicated measurements).',\n",
       " 'The preceding results show that by using 2P as a solvent for PSf polymers, membrane with bi-continuous morphology in the entire cross-section can obtained. Having bi-continuous structure would be beneficial for faster permeation unlike cellular-like structure which are closed pores (not interconnected).',\n",
       " 'In the introduction, we have stated the different ways to suppress macrovoid growth in polymeric membranes. Among these different approaches, adding additives into the casting solution seem to be the easiest and most economical. PVP, PEG, non-solvent, etc., are some of the most used additives to mitigate macrovoid growth. In this study, we chose water as the additive because of its abundancy and availability, cost-effectiveness, and it will not be trapped in the polymer domain (unlike polymeric additives) during the phase-inversion process. Fig. 5 shows the entire cross-section of the different membranes prepared: P8, P10, P12, and P15 which consist of 8, 10, 12 and 15\\xa0wt% of PSf in 2P, respectively. The amount of water added into the casting solution was dependent on the cloud point evaluation from Fig. 2, that is to avoid phase-separation of the casting solution. For P8, the amount of DI water was varied from 0 to 1.5\\xa0wt%. Meanwhile, for P10 and P12, 0–1.0\\xa0wt% of water was added. Lastly, for P12, the concentration of DI water was from 0 to 0.8\\xa0wt%. As can be seen below, it is evident that as the concentration of PSf in the casting solution is increased (from P8 to P15), the initiation position of the macrovoid could be found deeper in the cross-section of the membranes. This can be explained by the increase in viscosity of the casting solution, which slowed down the mass transfer kinetics (this will be proven in the next section). After water was added into the casting solution of P8, it was found that the initial position of macrovoid formation appeared deeper in the cross-section of the membrane. Consequently, when more water was added (P8-D1.5), all the macrovoids were suppressed. Similar trends were observed in P8, P12 and P15, as more non-solvent is introduced in the casting solution, complete macrovoid suppression was achieved. In addition, the bi-continuous structure was well maintained in all conditions as evidenced in the SEM images in Fig. 6 which displays the higher magnification of the middle part of the cross-section. Moreover, no skin layer is observable in all PSf membranes as illustrated in Fig. S1. In contrast, it seems that the amount of additive did not directly affect the surface morphology of the membranes (Fig. S2), which all remained highly porous.',\n",
       " 'It is a known fact that as the amount of solid content in the casting solution is increased, the porosity and pore size of the membranes would decrease. Therefore, a decline in the porosity and pore size of the membranes (P8\\xa0>\\xa0P10\\xa0>\\xa0P12\\xa0>\\xa0P15) is expected, and is proven in Fig. 7. Based on this illustration, the porosity of the pristine membranes gradually decreased from 88% to 76% when the PSf concentration was increased from 8\\xa0wt% to 15\\xa0wt%. Likewise, the pore size was reduced from 0.65\\xa0μm to 0.30\\xa0μm. It was also apparent that the incorporation of non-solvent also resulted in a decrease in porosity and pore size of the membranes (in the same PSf concentration). The decrease in porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the disappearance of the large voids across the membranes. However, it is important to note that as the solid content is the same with and without water, we should acknowledge that porosity difference could only be due to the membrane thickness differences (Fig. S3). For a same solid content and a same thickness, the porosity should be the same, regardless of the presence of macrovoids.',\n",
       " 'The viscosity of the casting solutions holds a vital role in determining the morphology of the membranes [40]. With this, we measured the viscosity of PSf/2P casting solutions and of PSf/2P/water solutions. Since the viscosity of the polymer solution is shear-rate dependent, we report in the following zero-shear viscosity. The solution viscosity logically increased with increasing polymer concentration (Fig. 8). Moreover, the viscosity tended to be low and constant below a certain concentration threshold and then drastically increased. According to polymer solution theory, there is a critical overlap concentration (C*) of polymer coils, which is the crossover concentration between the dilute and the semi-dilute concentration region. If the concentration of the polymer is below C*, the polymer clusters are segregated from each other, and it is commonly referred to as dilute regime. On the other hand, if the concentration is above C*, the solution becomes entangled as a result of the overlap between adjacent macromolecular coils. The concentration of the polymer at which the onset of significant entanglement occurs is pertained to as critical entanglement concentration (Ce), and it is within the semi-dilute entangled regime [87,88]. PSf is predominantly hydrophobic due to the large presence of aryl groups. When water is added into the system, the PSf chains will be oriented in a way that the hydrophilic segments, sulfonyl and ether groups, are exposed which was induced by hydrophobic hydration [89]. This phenomenon triggers the aryl groups to be “coiled up or hidden” to decrease the enthalpy of the system creating spots of cohesion entanglement among the PSf chains (as shown in the insets of Fig. 8). Moreover, as stated in the previous studies of Kahrs and Schellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42], the addition of water into the casting solution could lead to interchain hydrogen bonding which can result in increased which can result in decreased solvent power and aggregation of the macromolecules which then induces the viscosity of the system to be enhanced. Therefore, as more water is added into the casting solution, more points of entanglement among the polymer chains are created causing the viscosity to be enhanced.',\n",
       " 'By taking the straight lines used to fit the curves of the log-log plot of the zero-shear viscosity and PSf concentration (Fig. 9), we were able to determine the critical overlap concentration and the critical entanglement concentration of the casting solutions without additive, and with 0.5\\xa0wt% and 1.0\\xa0wt% water. In Fig. 9a, in which no additive was additive into the casting solutions, we determined that the C* is 9.7\\xa0wt%, and no onset of entanglement occurred from 2\\xa0wt% to 18\\xa0wt% (it is probable that Ce would occur at higher concentrations). However, when 0.5\\xa0wt% and 1.0\\xa0wt% of water were added into the casting solution, 2 things could be observed: (1) critical chain entanglement ensued; and (2) both values of C* and Ce decreased with increasing amount of additive added. Correlating these values with the SEM from Fig. 5, we can infer that the addition of water has caused the onset of chain entanglement which evidently increased the viscosity which aided in the mitigation of macrovoid growth. Also, when the polymer concentration in the casting solution is higher than the critical chain entanglement, the initiation position of macrovoids shifted to somewhere below the membrane surface. Conversely, when there is no chain entanglement (PSf-D0), macrovoids are present along the cross-section of the membrane. In addition, when more non-solvent additive is added into the casting solution, the entanglement concentration was found to decrease (increased chain entanglement), suggesting that for a much lower polymer concentration, we can fine-tune the substructure of the membrane. This can provide positive impacts in terms of fabricating membranes at a more cost-effective approach.',\n",
       " 'Aside from this, we have also analyzed the viscoelastic properties of the casting solution and how it is being influenced by the addition of water. Fig. S4 presents the graph of the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) as a function of angular frequency. The storage modulus is a measure of the elasticity of the solution and pertains to its ability to store energy. On the other hand, the loss modulus is a measure of the viscosity of the solution and pertains to its ability to dissipate. If G″\\xa0>\\xa0G′ the system behaves like a liquid while if the G″\\xa0<\\xa0G′ behaves like a gel [87]. Based on Fig. S4, all the systems exhibit a viscous behavior. When water is added, both G′ and G″ visibly increased which can be attributed to the enhanced viscosity induced by the hydrogen bonding and subsequent chain entanglement [41].',\n",
       " 'Aside from probing into the thermodynamics and viscosity of the PSf/2P/water system, it is also essential to investigate the kinetics of the phase-inversion process. We observed the movement of the phase separation front of the casting solutions with varying concentrations of polysulfone under an optical microscope as depicted in Fig. 10. As it was pointed out in the previous sections of this work, higher viscosity could slow down the kinetics of the mass transfer hence, when the concentration of PSf was increased from 8\\xa0wt% to 15\\xa0wt%, it was clear that it took the non-solvent a longer time to traverse the P15 system.',\n",
       " 'In fact, when comparing the position of the diffusion front as a function of time for different concentration of PSf in 2P without additives as illustrated in Fig. 11a, after 120\\xa0s of phase inversion, the non-solvent travelled a distance of 0.45\\xa0mm, 0.32\\xa0mm, 0.30\\xa0mm, 0.25\\xa0mm for P8, P10, P12 and P15, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 11b presents the related diffusion distance vs. square root of time plot.',\n",
       " 'Assuming that the dark ridges found after the interface corresponds to the initial diffusion position of water, then the diffusivity of water in the system (Dw/s) can be determined based on the equation proposed by Strathmann et al. [61].(2b)d2=4(Dw/sετ)(1−CW1+CW)twhere d denotes the diffusion distance, ε/τ represents a geometrical factor for the porosity and tortuosity of the membrane being formed, CW is the water concentration at the interface between the non-solvent and the polymeric system, t pertains to time.',\n",
       " 'Under the supposition that the concentration of water in the solution at the point of precipitation is small relative to unity so, equation (2b) can be simplified to the following expression (equation (3b)) to determine the effective diffusivity De. This De contains the geometrical correction factor ε/τ.(3b)d=2(Det)0.5',\n",
       " 'With the above expression, the calculated effective diffusivity of water in P8, P10, P12 and P15 are 3.23\\xa0×\\xa010−4, 2.60\\xa0×\\xa010−4, 2.51\\xa0×\\xa010−4 and 2.08\\xa0×\\xa010−4\\xa0mm2/s, respectively. Thus, verifying our previous claim that with higher viscosity, kinetics of mass transfer was evidently slowed down.',\n",
       " 'Next, the kinetics of non-solvent (water) in the PSf/2P/water casting solutions were examined and presented in Fig. 12. In P8 system, no significant trend was seen which could be attributed to the considerably lower viscosity of the system. Moreover, due to the low polymer concentration (8\\xa0wt%), the position of the system lies close to the binodal line, which makes it easier to become thermodynamically unstable. On the other hand, in P10 – P15 systems, it was evident that there is an increasing trend in the non-solvent kinetics when the amount of additive was increased. This was then further verified by calculating the diffusion rates of the non-solvent as presented in Fig. 13.',\n",
       " 'In 2010, Hong et al. proposed a model for the initiation of macrovoids based on the relationship of the initial position of the macrovoid (L) and effective diffusivity (De, which is similar to diffusion coefficient) versus the normalized polymer concentration(C/Ce) [39]. According to their study, the PSf/2P, PSf/2P/water (0.5\\xa0wt%), and PSf/NMP systems can be fitted into an exponential growth curve. Similar relationship is also observed in our PSf/2P/water system as presented in Fig. S5.',\n",
       " 'Although macrovoids permits fast permeability due to their high porosity, they are considered weak points in the membrane because they are prone to compaction under high pressure operation, which eventually leads to poor flux performance over time. From the previous sections, we have provided data that shows the by adding water into the casting solution, we are able to successfully mitigate the growth of these unwanted macrovoids. Moreover, we have offered in-depth analysis as to how the thermodynamics of the ternary system, kinetics and viscosity affect the morphology of the membranes. To further our study, we have investigated the effects of incorporating additives into the casting solution to help suppress macrovoids to the permeability properties and mechanical strengths of the membranes as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Since Figs. 4 and 5 prove that all of the fabricated membranes are suitable for microfiltration, we decided to investigate the pure water flux of the pristine and modified PSf membranes under a transmembrane pressure of 1\\xa0bar. Fig. 14 shows that even though the macrovoids disappeared, similar permeabilities are still maintained which could be due to two possible reasons: First, the additive concentration did not directly influence the surface porosity of the membranes having the same polymeric content. Second, although the huge macrovoids were suppressed, the interconnected pores along the cross-section still permitted fast permeation.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, Fig. 15 displays the measured modulus of elasticity of the membranes obtained from tensile stress/strain plots. At the outset, it is important to note that the mechanical strength of the membrane is in correlation to the concentration of the polymer. Therefore, it is obvious that as the concentration of PSf is increased, the modulus of elasticity also increased from 40 to 130\\xa0MPa. Besides, as we increased the PSf concentration in 2P, we were also able to prevent the initiation of macrovoid growth near the top part of the membrane and then the formation of the macrovoids across the entire cross-section of the membranes. This has led to the increase in the modulus of elasticity of the modified membranes. Additionally, we compared the mechanical strength of PSf membrane prepared with 2P to that of prepared using NMP (Fig. S6). As expected, the large macrovoids found in PSf/NMP membranes acted as weak spots which contributed to it having lower tensile strength.',\n",
       " 'To summarize, using 2P as a solvent allowed the easy fabrication of PSf MF (skin-free) membranes through NIPS process, which is deemed difficult to achieve using other solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc without the addition of additives. However, macrovoids are still present along its cross-section. The addition of a sufficient amount of water (which content is dependent upon the phase diagram) permits to totally suppress the macrovoids without sacrificing the pore size and porosity of the membranes. So, skin-free and macrovoids-free PSf membranes can be prepared using 2P as the solvent and water as a non-solvent additive. As the pore connectivity is maintained, so is the membrane permeability. But as the morphology of the cross-section is no longer asymmetric with large macrovoids, instead replaced with symmetric with continuous connected domains, the mechanical strength of the membranes was enhanced without waiving the permeability. These findings could help provide an easy and economical approach to suppress macrovoids without using expensive organic or inorganic additives, or using intricate methods to fabricate macrovoid-free membranes. Fig. 16 illustrates the short summary of these results.',\n",
       " 'To evaluate the viability of using non-solvent as an additive to suppress macrovoids, we have utilized other solvents such NMP DMAc and DMF to prepare polysulfone membranes. We initially established their respective ternary diagrams (Fig. 2 for PSf/NMP/water and Fig. 17 for PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water) to first identify up to how much water could be added into the casting solution before phase separation occurs. Based on the solubility parameters from Table 1, DMF and DMAc solvents are also considered good solvents to PSf polymer. This is also evidenced by the large homogeneous area of PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water ternary systems illustrated in Fig. 17. Moreover, the cloud points also revealed that it would take more coagulant (water) to induce demixing of the system.',\n",
       " 'In order to find out the versatility of the water as a means to prevent macrovoid formation, we have prepared 25% of PSf in NMP, 20% of PSf in DMAc, and 15% of PSf in DMF via the NIPS process. We have varied the concentrations of the additive from 0 to 3\\xa0wt% for PSf/NMP, 0–2\\xa0wt% for PSf/DMAc and 0–1\\xa0wt% for PSf/DMF casting solutions. The SEM cross-section images in Fig. 18 reveal that when water was added into the casting solution of PSf/NMP, the macrovoids were effectively suppressed. Similar phenomena were observed in PSf membranes prepared using DMAc (Fig. 19a) and DMF (Fig. 19b) solvents. These results prove that using water as an additive in the casting solution provides a practical and cost-effective approach to tune the morphology of polysulfone membranes from controlling the growth of macrovoids to its overall suppression.',\n",
       " 'In this study we first investigated the use of 2P solvent to prepare polysulfone membranes in replace of the more commonly used NMP solvent. Being a poorer solvent than NMP, the nature of solvency of 2P greatly influenced the kinetics, viscosity, and thermodynamics stability of the system. The following major conclusions can be made:•The fabricated membranes are skin-free and fall in the microfiltration range.•The lower affinity of 2P towards polysulfone (compared to NMP) greatly increased the viscosity of the casting solution which prevented coarsening.
