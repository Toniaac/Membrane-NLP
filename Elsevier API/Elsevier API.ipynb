Imidazole ligands contained in casting solutions were released and reacted with divalent Zn2+ cations pre-loaded on non-woven fabric supporting layers. The capillary filling pore size and molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) Stokes solute rejection pore size of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF were tuned by varying the loading levels of Zn (II), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and imidazole, as well as the NIPS reaction time. With thinned PSF separating layer (200\\u2013500\\u202fnm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed 7 times higher water permeance (up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar)) and greatly enhanced dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes. Graphical abstract Tight ultra-filtration (TUF) membranes with in-situ grown zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) particles embedded in and packed under porous polysulfone (PSF) separating layers were prepared using non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) processes. With thinned PSF separating layer (200\\u2013500\\u202fnm) and embedded water permeating internal channels in the ZIF particles, these membranes showed ultra-high water permeance (up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar) and greatly enhanced dye rejection selectivity over salts.

Recently, membrane based separation technologies are adopted in these processes in the treatment of high-salinity textile waste water to reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and simplified operations [8\\u201311]. Since conventional ultra-filtration (UF) membranes had too big pore sizes (0.2\\u20130.01\\u202fmm) to retain dyes [1,12,13], and nanofiltration (NF) membranes had too small pore sizes (&lt;2\\u202fnm)for dye/salt separation, tight ultra-filtration (TUF) (or \\u201cloose\\u201d nanofiltration) membranes with pore sizes between 2 and 10\\u202fnm were developed to have high efficiency for separating dye molecules from inorganic salts [1,2]. Various processes had been developed to prepare TUF membranes. Lan [14] et al. developed nano-porous phenolic resins based TUF membranes. Chen [15] et al. improved dye retention of ceramic TUF membranes by grafting amino silanes (KH-551). Polyether sulfone (PES) and sulphonated polysulfone (SPSF) based TUF membranes were also developed for dye/salt separation [16]. However, the trade-off between water flux and dye retention selectivity, had thwarted the applications of TUF membranes [17]. There is a strong need in developing high flux TUF membranes with high dye retention selectivity. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), assembled from inorganic ions and organic ligand [18,19], bearing controllable internal water selective permeating channels to promote water permeation [20,21]. They could be grown on porous substrates by the processes of in-situ chemical, electrochemical [22], layered [23], or stepwise liquid-phase epitaxial deposition [24] to form high performance MOF membranes [25\\u201327]. Flexible mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) could be prepared by adding ZIF particles into polymers matrices [28\\u201331]. However, agglomeration of ZIF particles in these membranes could form non-selective defects, leading to reduced dye rejection rates. In this work, a novel strategy was developed involving in-situ growing of ZIF particles during the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on the supporting non-woven fabrics(NWF), and then reacted with 2-methimidazole (2MIM) released from the casting solutions during NIPS processes. ZIF particles were in-situ grown, embedded in and packed under the thinned polysulfone porous surface layer to promote water permeation while the molecular weight cut off (MWCO) Stokes pore sizes were effectively controlled by tuning the inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. The impact from variations in Zn (II) loading level, 2MIM content, reaction time, and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the porosity and performance of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs was systematically investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials N,N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP, ≥99.0% purity) purchased from Shanghai Taitan, Ltd. (Shanghai, China) was used as solvent and deionized water was used as non-solvent in the NIPS processes. Polysulfone (PSF, S6010) was purchased from Dongguan Haosheng Plastic Material Company and dried under vacuum at 60\\u202f°C for 12h before use. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, &gt;98%)) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM, Analytical Grade) were purchased from Aladdin, Shanghai. Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Congo Red (CR), Methyl Orange (MO) and Methylene Blue (MBe) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai) Reagent Company, Shanghai Maclean Biochemical Technology Company and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent company respectively. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWF was purchased from Hangzhou Water Treatment Center. Preparation of ZIF-8 particles: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in DI water at a concentration of 1.23\\u202fg/100ml and ultrasound for 20\\u202fmin. At the same time, 2MIM was dissolved in Methanol at a concentration of 0.9\\u202fg/100ml and ultrasound for 20\\u202fmin. Then 2-MeIM solution were poured into zinc nitrate solution at a 1:6\\u202fvolume ratio and let alone for another 12\\u202fh. The ZIF-8 particles were separated using centrifuging device, and dried at 30\\u202f°C in oven for 1\\u202fh before use. 2.2 Preparation of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs 18g of polysulfone (PSF), and various amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM) were added to 74\\u202fg of N,N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), as shown in Table 1 . By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50\\u202f°C (200\\u202frpm), a homogeneous casting solution was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The PET NWF were cut into 16cm\\u202f×\\u202f16cm piece and then was poured and completely wet by a 30\\u202fg/L Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF was then dried in oven at 30\\u202f°C for 0.5\\u202fh before use. The fully defoamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters 0f 14cm\\u202f×\\u202f14\\u202fcm, and then immersed into a 50\\u202f°C deionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30\\u202f°C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.3 Preparation of ZIF/PSF UF MMMs (TUF-020-d6) by direct adding method 18g of polysulfone (PSF), 6g of ZIF-8 particles, and 2g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), with a total mass of 100\\u202fg. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50\\u202f°C (200\\u202frpm), a casting suspension was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The fully de-foamed suspension was then cast onto the pristine PET NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two PTFE frames with inner diameters of 14cm\\u202f×\\u202f14cm, and then immersed into a 50\\u202f°C de-ionized (DI) water bath for 45 minutes for phase separation. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30\\u202f°C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.4 Characterization Prior to taking cross sectional images, the membrane samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ruptured to avoid excessive damage. The surface and cross sectional morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, Hitachi HITACHI, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10\\u202fkV with a thin layer of gold sputtered to improve electron conductivity. The roughness was measured using an AFM (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker, USA) using average from three 5μm\\u202f×\\u202f5μm areas selected. X-ray diffraction measurements of ZIFs were conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Thermo ARL, SCINTAGX'TRA) at 40\\u202fkV and 40\\u202fmA with Cu-Pb radiations. The samples were scanned in the 2θ range of 5\\u201340° at a step size of 0.02° and a scanning speed of 0.2\\u202fsec per step. The hydrophilicity was evaluated using a contact angle measuring instrument (OCA-15EC Olympus, SZH 10). To obtain the exact contact angle for each sample, the average of five different areas was reported. Surface charges of the membranes were inspected using a zeta potential analyzer (Anton Paar SurPass 3, Austria) with the pH ranging from 3 to 10. Each datum point was averaged from three results in the same pH value. The chemical compositions of the membrane surface were estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA). The concentration of zinc ions was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Elan DRC-e, USA). The values of the concentration were obtained from the average of three random areas. BET N2 adsorption isotherm were determined using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 system at Bath Temperature of −195.850\\u202f°C. Surface area was calculated using multi-point method. 2.5 Membrane pore sizes determination The capillary pore diameter (dc) distribution were analyzed using the NV Porolux500 system, Germany. Peak sharpness could be calculated by dividing the peak height value with peak width value at half the peak height for each peak. Solute MWCO Stokes pore size distribution was determined using the method by Zhu et at [32]. The Stokes diameters of the membrane were calculated from following equation: (1) d p = 2 * 0.0397 × M 0.43 where M was the molecular weight of PEG at 90% rejection. Then the pore size distribution of the membrane was expressed as follows: (2) dR ( r p ) d r p = 1 r p ln σ p 2 Π exp [ − ( ln r p − ln μ p ) 2 2 ( ln σ p ) 2 ] where mp was the geometric mean radius of the solute at R\\u202f=\\u202f50%, and sp was geometric standard deviation, equals to the solute radius ratio at R\\u202f=\\u202f84.13% over that at 50%, obtained from modeled straight lines between R over log rs. rs, the stokes radius of PEG solutes could be calculated using following equation: (3) log rs = −1.4854 + 0.461 log Mw where, Mw was the molecular weight of PEG solute used. 2.6 Membrane permeability and retention Pure water flux (PWF) was measured using a dead-end filtration system with an effective area of 19.645\\u202fcm2\\u202fat 25\\u202f°C and 1\\u202fbar. The pure water permeating volume were taken every 15 minutes until reaching a constant value. The pure water flux (Jw1) can be calculated using the following equation. (4) J w 1 = Q A Δ t where Q was the volume of permeate water (L), A was the effective membrane area (m2), and Δt was the permeation time (h). The membrane rejection performance was determined using solutions of 0.1\\u202fg/L dyes or 1\\u202fg/L Na2SO4 after compressed at 1\\u202fbar for 1h in the feed cell. UV\\u2013Vis spectro photometers with wavelengths of 497\\u202fnm (CR), 463\\u202fnm (MO), and 662\\u202fnm (MBe) were used, respectively, to determine the dye concentrations in the feed and permeate cells. The concentration of inorganic salts were determined by electrical conductivity meter (FE 38, Mettler Toledo). The rejection ratio could be calculated by the following equation: (5) R ( % ) = ( 1 − C p C f ) × 100 % where Cp and Cf were the concentrations of the solute in the feed cell and the permeate cell, respectively. Retention selectivity of the membrane between component A over B was calculated by following formula: (6) SA/B\\u202f=\\u202fRA/RB where RA and RB refer to the rejection ratio of the membrane to component A and B respectively. All the values presented in the figures were averages from five separated measurement of different samples while the error values were the standard deviation of the five measurements. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs As shown in Fig. 1 , ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs were prepared by in-situ growing ZIF particles during the NIPS process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on PET NWF from nitrate solutions, and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As shown in Table 1, the Zn(II), PVP and 2MIM loading levels as well as NIPS time were varied to study the structures and performance of the formed TUF-MMMs. Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MBe) and methyl orange (MO) in addition to Na2SO4 were used as solutes to differentiate the filtration performance of the membranes. XRD diffraction and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analyses were performed on the membranes to confirm that the grown particles were indeed ZIF-8. The presence of ZIF particles in TUF-Zn- PVP- 2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) could be clearly proved by the characteristic peaks at 10.5 °, 12.86 °, 16.62 ° and 18.22 °in Fig. 2 a. In Fig. 2b\\u2013c, the IR peaks for SO from polysulfone at 1145\\u202fcm−1, for N\\u2013C from PVP at 1234\\u202fcm−1, together with the new peaks at 1660\\u202fcm−1 and 3487\\u202fcm−1 for CN and N\\u2013H bonds from 2MIM, and the increasing surface Zn content from XPS and EDX elemental scan (Figure S-2 and Fig. 3 in supporting information), could fully support the formation of ZIF particles in ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs. Additional XRD characterization on the ZIF particles made with and without PVP in Figure S-1, also proved that the presence of PVP did not alter the crystalline frameworks of ZIF particles. The structure and properties of TUF-PVP (TUF-020), TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320), TUF-Zn-PVP-2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) membranes were compared to reveal the unique characteristics of TUF-MMMs made from in-situ ZIF growing NIPS process. In Fig. 3 c, ZIF particles in the sizes of 200\\u2013500\\u202fnm could be observed in the surface separating layers of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs (TUF-326) not in the structures of TUF-PVP (TUF-020) and TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320). ZIF-8 particles of TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) were added directly in the casting solution and fully sealed inside the PSF matrix as shown in Fig. 3d. These agreed well with its low BET surface area values (14.73\\u202fm2/g) shown in Fig. 4 d. The in-situ formation of ZIF particles in the NIPS process had also greatly thinned the top PSF skin layers, from 937\\u202fnm (TUF-020), 893\\u202fnm (TUF-320) and 762\\u202fnm (TUF-020-d6), to 338\\u202fnm in TUF-326, leading to greatly reduced permeation resistance. In-situ formed ZIF particles in TUF-326 had fresh and open internal channels for solvent adsorption. These hydrophilic internal channels cross the fresh crystalline bodies of the embedded ZIF particles served as short-cuts for water permeating as illustrated in Scheme 1 , leading to the highest water flux value of 247\\u202fL/(m2·h) (Tables S\\u20136, Fig. 5 c), 7.2 times higher than that of TUF-020. The internal pores of ZIF-8 particles were too small in size for N2 to penetrate, but the external surface of the formed ZIF-8 particles had added more than 2\\u202fm2/g open specific surfaces to the total available open surfaces of TUF-326 although TUF-020, TUF -320, and TUF-326 had specific surface areas in the same ranges of 40\\u201343\\u202fm2/g in Fig. 4. Directly added pre-made ZIF-8 particles actually reduced the available adsorption specific surface area to 23.47\\u202fm2/g by altering the structure of the formed membranes, indicating very little outer surfaces of added ZIF-8 particles were available for N2 adsorption. 3.2 Superior separating performance of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs Due to the molecular sieving effect of their internal channels in the sizes of 0.30\\u20130.34\\u202fnm, the embedded or packed ZIF-8 particles only selectively enhanced the transportation of water molecules with smaller dynamic diameters of 0.27\\u20130.32\\u202fnm. Larger filtrate particles including dye molecules or hydrated ions could only permeate through the gaps between the particles, or the boundary voids between the particles and the PSU substrates. In the formed PSF separating layer, water molecules should see a lot of short-cuts to pass through inside the ZIF-8 particulate crystalline bodies, while the filtrates dissolved in it would see a lot of impenetrable balls blocking their movements. Inclusion of non-porous particle or particles with larger internal channels would not have the same selective effects. As illustrated in Scheme 1, multiple dimensional pores were formed on the surfaces of ZIF/PSF MMMs embedded in and packed under situ grown ZIF particles, including capillary solvent absorbing pores from the PSF matrix with the diameters of dc (80\\u2013185\\u202fnm), MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores between the ZIF particles with the gap diameters of dr (2.8\\u201310.2\\u202fnm) and also internal water permeating pores of ZIF particles with the diameters of di (0.30\\u20130.34\\u202fnm). As shown in Tables S\\u20133, the longest dimension of dye molecules were in the range of 1.1\\u20132.5\\u202fnm. Due to the existence of functional groups (\\u2013SO3 -, and \\u2013NH2) in the dye molecular structures, Donan charge effects and agglomeration of dye molecules had caused their rejections by TUF membranes with larger MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores of 2.8\\u201310.2\\u202fnm. Therefore, ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers could promote water permeation and block solute permeation, so solute MWCO Stokes pore sizes were actually controlled by narrowest inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the separating layers had reduced capillary solvent filling diameters (dc) and solute rejection Stokes diameters (dr), and increased pore size distribution sharpness for TUF-326, resulting in improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over Na2SO4 (Fig. 5, Tables S\\u20134). For comparison, TUF-020-d6 prepared using pre-made ZIF particles directly added in the casting solution had also shown reduced capillary absorption diameter (dc) and solute rejection diameters (dr), but with less peak sharpness. Directly added pre-made bulky ZIF-8 particles in the water of NIPS process may not be able to be effectively immobilized into the porous surfaces of formed PSF membranes while directly added bulky ZIF-8 particles in the organic phase casting solution could not migrate to the inter-phasal boundary areas during the NIPS process. They were mostly sealed inside the PSF matrix with limited open surface area and water permeating internal pores (Fig. 3d), leading to less water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity (Fig. 5c and d) than TUF-326. Only in the in situ formation process could the hydrophilic 2MIM ligand molecules be migrated to and enriched in the inter-phasal boundary areas to form exposed ZIF-balls that were embedded in or packed under the newly formed PSF porous separating layers for superior filtration performance. 3.3 Impact of preparation conditions As discussed above, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the PSF separating layer could promote both water permeation and dye retention selectivity, which could be further optimized by adjusting the parameters of the NIPS processes, including the concentrations of PVP, 2MIM and Zn(II)as well as the NIPS reaction time. Following experiments were conducted to fully illustrated the effects. 3.3.1 Effects of PVP level Membranes TUF-304, 314, 324 and 344 were prepared with the PVP loading in casting solution increased from 0, 1, 2\\u20134\\u202fg/100ml, respectively when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18\\u202fwt%, and the content of and 2MIM in casting solution was kept at 4\\u202fg/100ml. From Fig. 8, it is clear that with the increase of the PVP content in the casting solution, capillary diameter (dc) (Fig. 8a, Tables S\\u20138) peak value was increased from 79.6 to 107.5\\u202fnm with decreased peak sharpness. The particle sizes of ZIF-8 embedded and entrapped were kept between about 250-300\\u202fnm while the top skin thickness was kept in the range of 325\\u2013375\\u202fnm (Figs. 6\\u20137 ). As shown in Fig. 7, the surface roughness was increased with improved hydrophilicity from more PVP loading. The water flux was gradually increased from 35.6 to 247.4\\u202fL/(m2·h) from TUF-304 to TUF-344 due to increased capillary pore sizes and surface hydrophilicity after the formation of more embedded ZIF particles. However, the solute rejection rates of the membranes were gradually decreased due to the enlarged solute rejection pore size (dr) and reduced pore distribution sharpness as shown in Fig. 8b. The retention selectivity between CR and Na2SO4 were greatly increased from 7 to 19 due to the faster reduction in Na2SO4 salt rejection rate. Balancing between the flux and rejection, PVP level was kept at 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution to have maximize MO/Na2SO4 retention selectivity for further experiments. 3.3.2 Effects of 2MIM level Membranes TUF-320, 322, 324 and 326 were prepared with 2MIM loading in casting solution increased from 0, 2, 4\\u20136\\u202fg/100\\u202fml when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18\\u202fwt%, and the content of and PVP in casting solution was kept at 2\\u202fg/100ml. More ZIF-8 particles were formed from more 2MIM loaded, leading to improved surface hydrophilicity, decreased capillary pore diameter dc and MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter dr, and no obvious changes on surface roughness (Figs. S6\\u20137). The in-situ growing of the ZIF particles during the NIPS process involved the migration of Zn2+, from the PET NWF to the interphasal boundary and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As discussed before, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers had reduced PSF skin thickness and provided hydrophilic internal channels to promote water permeation. As expected, when the top skin PSF layer thickness was gradually reduced from 570, 476, 337 to 275\\u202fnm with more 2MIM loading, the water flux was increased from 105.2, 127.2, 197.5\\u2013247.4\\u202fL/(m2·h) (Fig. 9 c). At the same time, the MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pore size (dr) was reduced from 14.6 to 9\\u202fnm) with increased distribution peak sharpness (Fig. 9b), leading to greatly improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts (Fig. 9c and d). The optimal concentration of 2MIM was selected at 4% when most of the Zn(II) released had been converted to ZIF particles and the retention selectivity of dyes/salt started to level off at this point as revealed in Fig. 9d. 3.3.3 The effect of Zn(NO3)2 concentration Membranes TUF-024, 324, 624 and 924 were prepared with the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution increased from 0, 30, 60\\u201390\\u202fg/100ml, when the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9, more Zn2+ had formed more ZIF-8 particles on the membrane surfaces as well as in the separating layers while the surface skin thickness was kept in the range of 300\\u2013500\\u202fnm. Surface roughness was increased with reduced water contact angles (Fig. S10). Pre-loaded Zn (II) salts had significantly increased capillary diameter (dc) due to the accelerated diffusion of aqueous phase into organic phase driven by co-ordination reaction of Zn(II) with PVP molecules during the NIPS process. Although the capillary solvent adsorption pore sizes was increased with more Zn(II) content, the MWCO Stokes pore size was decreased with improved distribution peak sharpness. The water flux was increased due to increased capillary pore sizes while dye/salt retention selectivity was decreased due to reduced Stokes pore size (Fig. 10 ). 3.3.4 The effect of different reaction time Membranes TUF-324 samples. were prepared with varied NIPS time from 15, 30, 45\\u201360 minutes when Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/100ml, the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution, respectively. There is no significant change in membrane surface and cross-sectional images, PSF skin thickness, surface roughness and water contact angle (Figs. S12\\u201313). Surface capillary diameter was slightly decreased with reduced distribution peak sharpness while its MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter was decreased with increased peak distribution sharpness (Fig. S14). It is worth noting that a portion of ZIF-8 particles may have been lost during the sample preparation process, so the actual content may be more than observed in the cross-section images. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes of NIPS time (Fig. 11 ). The best NIPS reaction time should be controlled from 30-45 minutes. 3.4 Stability of membranes To test the operational efficiency of TUF membranes, the performance of TUF-324 and TUF-020 were compared in the dye/salt separation experiments using 1L solutions containing 0.1\\u202fg of CR and 1.0\\u202fg of Na2SO4 in the same mixture. The water permeance of TUF-324 was maintained in the range of 157.4 to 148.2\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar), about 7 times higher than those (23.5\\u201319.6\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar)) of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed much higher CR/Na2SO4 retention selectivity of 15\\u201316 than those of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed higher anti-fouling capacity than TUF-020 with less CR rejection decay over time (Fig. 12 ). 3.5 Comparison of performance of membranes with literature By comparing the filtration performance in this work with those reported in the literature, it is clear that ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with in-situ grown ZIF particles, TUF-326, 324, 624 and 924, had broken the Roberson trade-off outer bound between water permeance and retention selectivity (S) for CR/Na2SO4 [33\\u201337], MO/Na2SO4 [38\\u201342], MBe/Na2SO4 [38,39,43\\u201345], bearing high potential to be used in recycling and purifying dyes for dye and textile industries (Fig. 13 ). 4 Conclusion A new strategy has been developed to prepared ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with ultra-high water permeance and improved dye/salt retention selectivity involving in-situ grown ZIF particles during the NIPS process that embedded in and packed under the thinned PSF skin layers. More PVP loading in the casting solution increased capillary pore diameter (dc), Stokes solute rejection pore diameters (dr), surface roughness and hydrophilicity, resulting in increased water permeance and dye/salt retention selectivity, and decreased solute rejection rates. More 2MIM loading in the casting solution increased ZIF particle formation, improved surface hydrophilicity, reduced PSF skin thickness, capillary diameters and Stokes solute rejection diameters, leading to increased water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts. More Zn2+ formed more ZIF-8 particles, leading to higher surface roughness and reduced water contact angles, as well as increased water flux and decreased dye/salt retention selectivity. More reaction time led to decreased solute rejection diameter. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes reaction time while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes. With thinned PSF separating layer (200\\u2013500\\u202fnm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed greatly increased water permeance, up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar), and increased rejection rates (30\\u201399%) for dyes and dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes.

Imidazole ligands contained in casting solutions were released and reacted with divalent Zn2+ cations pre-loaded on non-woven fabric supporting layers. The capillary filling pore size and molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) Stokes solute rejection pore size of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF were tuned by varying the loading levels of Zn (II), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and imidazole, as well as the NIPS reaction time. With thinned PSF separating layer (200\\u2013500\\u202fnm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed 7 times higher water permeance (up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar)) and greatly enhanced dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes.\",\n",

Center for Membrane Separation and Water Science & Technology, College of Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310014, China. Center for Membrane Separation and Water Science & Technology College of Chemical Engineering Zhejiang University of Technology Hangzhou Zhejiang 310014 China Tight ultra-filtration (TUF) membranes with in-situ grown zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) particles embedded in and packed under porous polysulfone (PSF) separating layers were prepared using non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) processes. Imidazole ligands contained in casting solutions were released and reacted with divalent Zn2+ cations pre-loaded on non-woven fabric supporting layers. The capillary filling pore size and molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) Stokes solute rejection pore size of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF were tuned by varying the loading levels of Zn (II), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and imidazole, as well as the NIPS reaction time. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500\\u202fnm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed 7 times higher water permeance (up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar)) and greatly enhanced dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes.

Recently, membrane based separation technologies are adopted in these processes in the treatment of high-salinity textile waste water to reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and simplified operations [8–11]. Since conventional ultra-filtration (UF) membranes had too big pore sizes (0.2–0.01\\u202fmm) to retain dyes [1,12,13], and nanofiltration (NF) membranes had too small pore sizes (<2\\u202fnm)for dye/salt separation, tight ultra-filtration (TUF) (or “loose” nanofiltration) membranes with pore sizes between 2 and 10\\u202fnm were developed to have high efficiency for separating dye molecules from inorganic salts [1,2]. Various processes had been developed to prepare TUF membranes. Lan [14] et al. developed nano-porous phenolic resins based TUF membranes. Chen [15] et al. improved dye retention of ceramic TUF membranes by grafting amino silanes (KH-551). Polyether sulfone (PES) and sulphonated polysulfone (SPSF) based TUF membranes were also developed for dye/salt separation [16]. However, the trade-off between water flux and dye retention selectivity, had thwarted the applications of TUF membranes [17]. There is a strong need in developing high flux TUF membranes with high dye retention selectivity. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), assembled from inorganic ions and organic ligand [18,19], bearing controllable internal water selective permeating channels to promote water permeation [20,21]. They could be grown on porous substrates by the processes of in-situ chemical, electrochemical [22], layered [23], or stepwise liquid-phase epitaxial deposition [24] to form high performance MOF membranes [25–27]. Flexible mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) could be prepared by adding ZIF particles into polymers matrices [28–31]. However, agglomeration of ZIF particles in these membranes could form non-selective defects, leading to reduced dye rejection rates. In this work, a novel strategy was developed involving in-situ growing of ZIF particles during the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on the supporting non-woven fabrics(NWF), and then reacted with 2-methimidazole (2MIM) released from the casting solutions during NIPS processes. ZIF particles were in-situ grown, embedded in and packed under the thinned polysulfone porous surface layer to promote water permeation while the molecular weight cut off (MWCO) Stokes pore sizes were effectively controlled by tuning the inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. The impact from variations in Zn (II) loading level, 2MIM content, reaction time, and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the porosity and performance of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs was systematically investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials N,N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP, ≥99.0% purity) purchased from Shanghai Taitan, Ltd. (Shanghai, China) was used as solvent and deionized water was used as non-solvent in the NIPS processes. Polysulfone (PSF, S6010) was purchased from Dongguan Haosheng Plastic Material Company and dried under vacuum at 60\\u202f°C for 12h before use. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, >98%)) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM, Analytical Grade) were purchased from Aladdin, Shanghai. Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Congo Red (CR), Methyl Orange (MO) and Methylene Blue (MBe) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai) Reagent Company, Shanghai Maclean Biochemical Technology Company and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent company respectively. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWF was purchased from Hangzhou Water Treatment Center. Preparation of ZIF-8 particles: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in DI water at a concentration of 1.23\\u202fg/100ml and ultrasound for 20\\u202fmin. At the same time, 2MIM was dissolved in Methanol at a concentration of 0.9\\u202fg/100ml and ultrasound for 20\\u202fmin. Then 2-MeIM solution were poured into zinc nitrate solution at a 1:6\\u202fvolume ratio and let alone for another 12\\u202fh. The ZIF-8 particles were separated using centrifuging device, and dried at 30\\u202f°C in oven for 1\\u202fh before use. 2.2 Preparation of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs 18g of polysulfone (PSF), and various amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM) were added to 74\\u202fg of N,N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), as shown in Table 1 . By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50\\u202f°C (200\\u202frpm), a homogeneous casting solution was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The PET NWF were cut into 16cm\\u202f×\\u202f16cm piece and then was poured and completely wet by a 30\\u202fg/L Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF was then dried in oven at 30\\u202f°C for 0.5\\u202fh before use. The fully defoamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters 0f 14cm\\u202f×\\u202f14\\u202fcm, and then immersed into a 50\\u202f°C deionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30\\u202f°C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.3 Preparation of ZIF/PSF UF MMMs (TUF-020-d6) by direct adding method 18g of polysulfone (PSF), 6g of ZIF-8 particles, and 2g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), with a total mass of 100\\u202fg. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50\\u202f°C (200\\u202frpm), a casting suspension was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The fully de-foamed suspension was then cast onto the pristine PET NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two PTFE frames with inner diameters of 14cm\\u202f×\\u202f14cm, and then immersed into a 50\\u202f°C de-ionized (DI) water bath for 45 minutes for phase separation. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30\\u202f°C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.4 Characterization Prior to taking cross sectional images, the membrane samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ruptured to avoid excessive damage. The surface and cross sectional morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, Hitachi HITACHI, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10\\u202fkV with a thin layer of gold sputtered to improve electron conductivity. The roughness was measured using an AFM (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker, USA) using average from three 5μm\\u202f×\\u202f5μm areas selected. X-ray diffraction measurements of ZIFs were conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Thermo ARL, SCINTAGX\\'TRA) at 40\\u202fkV and 40\\u202fmA with Cu-Pb radiations. The samples were scanned in the 2θ range of 5–40° at a step size of 0.02° and a scanning speed of 0.2\\u202fsec per step. The hydrophilicity was evaluated using a contact angle measuring instrument (OCA-15EC Olympus, SZH 10). To obtain the exact contact angle for each sample, the average of five different areas was reported. Surface charges of the membranes were inspected using a zeta potential analyzer (Anton Paar SurPass 3, Austria) with the pH ranging from 3 to 10. Each datum point was averaged from three results in the same pH value. The chemical compositions of the membrane surface were estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA). The concentration of zinc ions was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Elan DRC-e, USA). The values of the concentration were obtained from the average of three random areas. BET N2 adsorption isotherm were determined using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 system at Bath Temperature of −195.850\\u202f°C. Surface area was calculated using multi-point method. 2.5 Membrane pore sizes determination The capillary pore diameter (dc) distribution were analyzed using the NV Porolux500 system, Germany. Peak sharpness could be calculated by dividing the peak height value with peak width value at half the peak height for each peak. Solute MWCO Stokes pore size distribution was determined using the method by Zhu et at [32]. The Stokes diameters of the membrane were calculated from following equation: (1) d p = 2 * 0.0397 × M 0.43 where M was the molecular weight of PEG at 90% rejection. Then the pore size distribution of the membrane was expressed as follows: (2) dR ( r p ) d r p = 1 r p ln σ p 2 Π exp [ − ( ln r p − ln μ p ) 2 2 ( ln σ p ) 2 ] where mp was the geometric mean radius of the solute at R\\u202f=\\u202f50%, and sp was geometric standard deviation, equals to the solute radius ratio at R\\u202f=\\u202f84.13% over that at 50%, obtained from modeled straight lines between R over log rs. rs, the stokes radius of PEG solutes could be calculated using following equation: (3) log rs = −1.4854 + 0.461 log Mw where, Mw was the molecular weight of PEG solute used. 2.6 Membrane permeability and retention Pure water flux (PWF) was measured using a dead-end filtration system with an effective area of 19.645\\u202fcm2\\u202fat 25\\u202f°C and 1\\u202fbar. The pure water permeating volume were taken every 15 minutes until reaching a constant value. The pure water flux (Jw1) can be calculated using the following equation. (4) J w 1 = Q A Δ t where Q was the volume of permeate water (L), A was the effective membrane area (m2), and Δt was the permeation time (h). The membrane rejection performance was determined using solutions of 0.1\\u202fg/L dyes or 1\\u202fg/L Na2SO4 after compressed at 1\\u202fbar for 1h in the feed cell. UV–Vis spectro photometers with wavelengths of 497\\u202fnm (CR), 463\\u202fnm (MO), and 662\\u202fnm (MBe) were used, respectively, to determine the dye concentrations in the feed and permeate cells. The concentration of inorganic salts were determined by electrical conductivity meter (FE 38, Mettler Toledo). The rejection ratio could be calculated by the following equation: (5) R ( % ) = ( 1 − C p C f ) × 100 % where Cp and Cf were the concentrations of the solute in the feed cell and the permeate cell, respectively. Retention selectivity of the membrane between component A over B was calculated by following formula: (6) SA/B\\u202f=\\u202fRA/RB where RA and RB refer to the rejection ratio of the membrane to component A and B respectively. All the values presented in the figures were averages from five separated measurement of different samples while the error values were the standard deviation of the five measurements. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs As shown in Fig. 1 , ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs were prepared by in-situ growing ZIF particles during the NIPS process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on PET NWF from nitrate solutions, and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As shown in Table 1, the Zn(II), PVP and 2MIM loading levels as well as NIPS time were varied to study the structures and performance of the formed TUF-MMMs. Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MBe) and methyl orange (MO) in addition to Na2SO4 were used as solutes to differentiate the filtration performance of the membranes. XRD diffraction and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analyses were performed on the membranes to confirm that the grown particles were indeed ZIF-8. The presence of ZIF particles in TUF-Zn- PVP- 2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) could be clearly proved by the characteristic peaks at 10.5 °, 12.86 °, 16.62 ° and 18.22 °in Fig. 2 a. In Fig. 2b–c, the IR peaks for SO from polysulfone at 1145\\u202fcm−1, for N–C from PVP at 1234\\u202fcm−1, together with the new peaks at 1660\\u202fcm−1 and 3487\\u202fcm−1 for CN and N–H bonds from 2MIM, and the increasing surface Zn content from XPS and EDX elemental scan (Figure S-2 and Fig. 3 in supporting information), could fully support the formation of ZIF particles in ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs. Additional XRD characterization on the ZIF particles made with and without PVP in Figure S-1, also proved that the presence of PVP did not alter the crystalline frameworks of ZIF particles. The structure and properties of TUF-PVP (TUF-020), TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320), TUF-Zn-PVP-2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) membranes were compared to reveal the unique characteristics of TUF-MMMs made from in-situ ZIF growing NIPS process. In Fig. 3 c, ZIF particles in the sizes of 200–500\\u202fnm could be observed in the surface separating layers of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs (TUF-326) not in the structures of TUF-PVP (TUF-020) and TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320). ZIF-8 particles of TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) were added directly in the casting solution and fully sealed inside the PSF matrix as shown in Fig. 3d. These agreed well with its low BET surface area values (14.73\\u202fm2/g) shown in Fig. 4 d. The in-situ formation of ZIF particles in the NIPS process had also greatly thinned the top PSF skin layers, from 937\\u202fnm (TUF-020), 893\\u202fnm (TUF-320) and 762\\u202fnm (TUF-020-d6), to 338\\u202fnm in TUF-326, leading to greatly reduced permeation resistance. In-situ formed ZIF particles in TUF-326 had fresh and open internal channels for solvent adsorption. These hydrophilic internal channels cross the fresh crystalline bodies of the embedded ZIF particles served as short-cuts for water permeating as illustrated in Scheme 1 , leading to the highest water flux value of 247\\u202fL/(m2·h) (Tables S–6, Fig. 5 c), 7.2 times higher than that of TUF-020. The internal pores of ZIF-8 particles were too small in size for N2 to penetrate, but the external surface of the formed ZIF-8 particles had added more than 2\\u202fm2/g open specific surfaces to the total available open surfaces of TUF-326 although TUF-020, TUF -320, and TUF-326 had specific surface areas in the same ranges of 40–43\\u202fm2/g in Fig. 4. Directly added pre-made ZIF-8 particles actually reduced the available adsorption specific surface area to 23.47\\u202fm2/g by altering the structure of the formed membranes, indicating very little outer surfaces of added ZIF-8 particles were available for N2 adsorption. 3.2 Superior separating performance of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs Due to the molecular sieving effect of their internal channels in the sizes of 0.30–0.34\\u202fnm, the embedded or packed ZIF-8 particles only selectively enhanced the transportation of water molecules with smaller dynamic diameters of 0.27–0.32\\u202fnm. Larger filtrate particles including dye molecules or hydrated ions could only permeate through the gaps between the particles, or the boundary voids between the particles and the PSU substrates. In the formed PSF separating layer, water molecules should see a lot of short-cuts to pass through inside the ZIF-8 particulate crystalline bodies, while the filtrates dissolved in it would see a lot of impenetrable balls blocking their movements. Inclusion of non-porous particle or particles with larger internal channels would not have the same selective effects. As illustrated in Scheme 1, multiple dimensional pores were formed on the surfaces of ZIF/PSF MMMs embedded in and packed under situ grown ZIF particles, including capillary solvent absorbing pores from the PSF matrix with the diameters of dc (80–185\\u202fnm), MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores between the ZIF particles with the gap diameters of dr (2.8–10.2\\u202fnm) and also internal water permeating pores of ZIF particles with the diameters of di (0.30–0.34\\u202fnm). As shown in Tables S–3, the longest dimension of dye molecules were in the range of 1.1–2.5\\u202fnm. Due to the existence of functional groups (–SO3 -, and –NH2) in the dye molecular structures, Donan charge effects and agglomeration of dye molecules had caused their rejections by TUF membranes with larger MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores of 2.8–10.2\\u202fnm. Therefore, ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers could promote water permeation and block solute permeation, so solute MWCO Stokes pore sizes were actually controlled by narrowest inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the separating layers had reduced capillary solvent filling diameters (dc) and solute rejection Stokes diameters (dr), and increased pore size distribution sharpness for TUF-326, resulting in improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over Na2SO4 (Fig. 5, Tables S–4). For comparison, TUF-020-d6 prepared using pre-made ZIF particles directly added in the casting solution had also shown reduced capillary absorption diameter (dc) and solute rejection diameters (dr), but with less peak sharpness. Directly added pre-made bulky ZIF-8 particles in the water of NIPS process may not be able to be effectively immobilized into the porous surfaces of formed PSF membranes while directly added bulky ZIF-8 particles in the organic phase casting solution could not migrate to the inter-phasal boundary areas during the NIPS process. They were mostly sealed inside the PSF matrix with limited open surface area and water permeating internal pores (Fig. 3d), leading to less water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity (Fig. 5c and d) than TUF-326. Only in the in situ formation process could the hydrophilic 2MIM ligand molecules be migrated to and enriched in the inter-phasal boundary areas to form exposed ZIF-balls that were embedded in or packed under the newly formed PSF porous separating layers for superior filtration performance. 3.3 Impact of preparation conditions As discussed above, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the PSF separating layer could promote both water permeation and dye retention selectivity, which could be further optimized by adjusting the parameters of the NIPS processes, including the concentrations of PVP, 2MIM and Zn(II)as well as the NIPS reaction time. Following experiments were conducted to fully illustrated the effects. 3.3.1 Effects of PVP level Membranes TUF-304, 314, 324 and 344 were prepared with the PVP loading in casting solution increased from 0, 1, 2–4\\u202fg/100ml, respectively when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18\\u202fwt%, and the content of and 2MIM in casting solution was kept at 4\\u202fg/100ml. From Fig. 8, it is clear that with the increase of the PVP content in the casting solution, capillary diameter (dc) (Fig. 8a, Tables S–8) peak value was increased from 79.6 to 107.5\\u202fnm with decreased peak sharpness. The particle sizes of ZIF-8 embedded and entrapped were kept between about 250-300\\u202fnm while the top skin thickness was kept in the range of 325–375\\u202fnm (Figs. 6–7 ). As shown in Fig. 7, the surface roughness was increased with improved hydrophilicity from more PVP loading. The water flux was gradually increased from 35.6 to 247.4\\u202fL/(m2·h) from TUF-304 to TUF-344 due to increased capillary pore sizes and surface hydrophilicity after the formation of more embedded ZIF particles. However, the solute rejection rates of the membranes were gradually decreased due to the enlarged solute rejection pore size (dr) and reduced pore distribution sharpness as shown in Fig. 8b. The retention selectivity between CR and Na2SO4 were greatly increased from 7 to 19 due to the faster reduction in Na2SO4 salt rejection rate. Balancing between the flux and rejection, PVP level was kept at 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution to have maximize MO/Na2SO4 retention selectivity for further experiments. 3.3.2 Effects of 2MIM level Membranes TUF-320, 322, 324 and 326 were prepared with 2MIM loading in casting solution increased from 0, 2, 4–6\\u202fg/100\\u202fml when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18\\u202fwt%, and the content of and PVP in casting solution was kept at 2\\u202fg/100ml. More ZIF-8 particles were formed from more 2MIM loaded, leading to improved surface hydrophilicity, decreased capillary pore diameter dc and MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter dr, and no obvious changes on surface roughness (Figs. S6–7). The in-situ growing of the ZIF particles during the NIPS process involved the migration of Zn2+, from the PET NWF to the interphasal boundary and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As discussed before, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers had reduced PSF skin thickness and provided hydrophilic internal channels to promote water permeation. As expected, when the top skin PSF layer thickness was gradually reduced from 570, 476, 337 to 275\\u202fnm with more 2MIM loading, the water flux was increased from 105.2, 127.2, 197.5–247.4\\u202fL/(m2·h) (Fig. 9 c). At the same time, the MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pore size (dr) was reduced from 14.6 to 9\\u202fnm) with increased distribution peak sharpness (Fig. 9b), leading to greatly improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts (Fig. 9c and d). The optimal concentration of 2MIM was selected at 4% when most of the Zn(II) released had been converted to ZIF particles and the retention selectivity of dyes/salt started to level off at this point as revealed in Fig. 9d. 3.3.3 The effect of Zn(NO3)2 concentration Membranes TUF-024, 324, 624 and 924 were prepared with the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution increased from 0, 30, 60–90\\u202fg/100ml, when the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9, more Zn2+ had formed more ZIF-8 particles on the membrane surfaces as well as in the separating layers while the surface skin thickness was kept in the range of 300–500\\u202fnm. Surface roughness was increased with reduced water contact angles (Fig. S10). Pre-loaded Zn (II) salts had significantly increased capillary diameter (dc) due to the accelerated diffusion of aqueous phase into organic phase driven by co-ordination reaction of Zn(II) with PVP molecules during the NIPS process. Although the capillary solvent adsorption pore sizes was increased with more Zn(II) content, the MWCO Stokes pore size was decreased with improved distribution peak sharpness. The water flux was increased due to increased capillary pore sizes while dye/salt retention selectivity was decreased due to reduced Stokes pore size (Fig. 10 ). 3.3.4 The effect of different reaction time Membranes TUF-324 samples. were prepared with varied NIPS time from 15, 30, 45–60 minutes when Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/100ml, the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution, respectively. There is no significant change in membrane surface and cross-sectional images, PSF skin thickness, surface roughness and water contact angle (Figs. S12–13). Surface capillary diameter was slightly decreased with reduced distribution peak sharpness while its MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter was decreased with increased peak distribution sharpness (Fig. S14). It is worth noting that a portion of ZIF-8 particles may have been lost during the sample preparation process, so the actual content may be more than observed in the cross-section images. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes of NIPS time (Fig. 11 ). The best NIPS reaction time should be controlled from 30-45 minutes. 3.4 Stability of membranes To test the operational efficiency of TUF membranes, the performance of TUF-324 and TUF-020 were compared in the dye/salt separation experiments using 1L solutions containing 0.1\\u202fg of CR and 1.0\\u202fg of Na2SO4 in the same mixture. The water permeance of TUF-324 was maintained in the range of 157.4 to 148.2\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar), about 7 times higher than those (23.5–19.6\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar)) of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed much higher CR/Na2SO4 retention selectivity of 15–16 than those of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed higher anti-fouling capacity than TUF-020 with less CR rejection decay over time (Fig. 12 ). 3.5 Comparison of performance of membranes with literature By comparing the filtration performance in this work with those reported in the literature, it is clear that ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with in-situ grown ZIF particles, TUF-326, 324, 624 and 924, had broken the Roberson trade-off outer bound between water permeance and retention selectivity (S) for CR/Na2SO4 [33–37], MO/Na2SO4 [38–42], MBe/Na2SO4 [38,39,43–45], bearing high potential to be used in recycling and purifying dyes for dye and textile industries (Fig. 13 ). 4 Conclusion A new strategy has been developed to prepared ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with ultra-high water permeance and improved dye/salt retention selectivity involving in-situ grown ZIF particles during the NIPS process that embedded in and packed under the thinned PSF skin layers. More PVP loading in the casting solution increased capillary pore diameter (dc), Stokes solute rejection pore diameters (dr), surface roughness and hydrophilicity, resulting in increased water permeance and dye/salt retention selectivity, and decreased solute rejection rates. More 2MIM loading in the casting solution increased ZIF particle formation, improved surface hydrophilicity, reduced PSF skin thickness, capillary diameters and Stokes solute rejection diameters, leading to increased water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts. More Zn2+ formed more ZIF-8 particles, leading to higher surface roughness and reduced water contact angles, as well as increased water flux and decreased dye/salt retention selectivity. More reaction time led to decreased solute rejection diameter. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes reaction time while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500\\u202fnm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed greatly increased water permeance, up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar), and increased rejection rates (30–99%) for dyes and dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes.

Imidazole ligands contained in casting solutions were released and reacted with divalent Zn2+ cations pre-loaded on non-woven fabric supporting layers. The capillary filling pore size and molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) Stokes solute rejection pore size of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF were tuned by varying the loading levels of Zn (II), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and imidazole, as well as the NIPS reaction time. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500\\u202fnm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed 7 times higher water permeance (up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar)) and greatly enhanced dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes. Graphical abstract Tight ultra-filtration (TUF) membranes with in-situ grown zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) particles embedded in and packed under porous polysulfone (PSF) separating layers were prepared using non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) processes. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500\\u202fnm) and embedded water permeating internal channels in the ZIF particles, these membranes showed ultra-high water permeance (up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar) and greatly enhanced dye rejection selectivity over salts.

Recently, membrane based separation technologies are adopted in these processes in the treatment of high-salinity textile waste water to reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and simplified operations [8–11]. Since conventional ultra-filtration (UF) membranes had too big pore sizes (0.2–0.01\\u202fmm) to retain dyes [1,12,13], and nanofiltration (NF) membranes had too small pore sizes (<2\\u202fnm)for dye/salt separation, tight ultra-filtration (TUF) (or “loose” nanofiltration) membranes with pore sizes between 2 and 10\\u202fnm were developed to have high efficiency for separating dye molecules from inorganic salts [1,2]. Various processes had been developed to prepare TUF membranes. Lan [14] et al. developed nano-porous phenolic resins based TUF membranes. Chen [15] et al. improved dye retention of ceramic TUF membranes by grafting amino silanes (KH-551). Polyether sulfone (PES) and sulphonated polysulfone (SPSF) based TUF membranes were also developed for dye/salt separation [16]. However, the trade-off between water flux and dye retention selectivity, had thwarted the applications of TUF membranes [17]. There is a strong need in developing high flux TUF membranes with high dye retention selectivity. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), assembled from inorganic ions and organic ligand [18,19], bearing controllable internal water selective permeating channels to promote water permeation [20,21]. They could be grown on porous substrates by the processes of in-situ chemical, electrochemical [22], layered [23], or stepwise liquid-phase epitaxial deposition [24] to form high performance MOF membranes [25–27]. Flexible mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) could be prepared by adding ZIF particles into polymers matrices [28–31]. However, agglomeration of ZIF particles in these membranes could form non-selective defects, leading to reduced dye rejection rates. In this work, a novel strategy was developed involving in-situ growing of ZIF particles during the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on the supporting non-woven fabrics(NWF), and then reacted with 2-methimidazole (2MIM) released from the casting solutions during NIPS processes. ZIF particles were in-situ grown, embedded in and packed under the thinned polysulfone porous surface layer to promote water permeation while the molecular weight cut off (MWCO) Stokes pore sizes were effectively controlled by tuning the inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. The impact from variations in Zn (II) loading level, 2MIM content, reaction time, and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the porosity and performance of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs was systematically investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials N,N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP, ≥99.0% purity) purchased from Shanghai Taitan, Ltd. (Shanghai, China) was used as solvent and deionized water was used as non-solvent in the NIPS processes. Polysulfone (PSF, S6010) was purchased from Dongguan Haosheng Plastic Material Company and dried under vacuum at 60\\u202f°C for 12h before use. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, >98%)) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM, Analytical Grade) were purchased from Aladdin, Shanghai. Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Congo Red (CR), Methyl Orange (MO) and Methylene Blue (MBe) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai) Reagent Company, Shanghai Maclean Biochemical Technology Company and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent company respectively. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWF was purchased from Hangzhou Water Treatment Center. Preparation of ZIF-8 particles: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in DI water at a concentration of 1.23\\u202fg/100ml and ultrasound for 20\\u202fmin. At the same time, 2MIM was dissolved in Methanol at a concentration of 0.9\\u202fg/100ml and ultrasound for 20\\u202fmin. Then 2-MeIM solution were poured into zinc nitrate solution at a 1:6\\u202fvolume ratio and let alone for another 12\\u202fh. The ZIF-8 particles were separated using centrifuging device, and dried at 30\\u202f°C in oven for 1\\u202fh before use. 2.2 Preparation of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs 18g of polysulfone (PSF), and various amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM) were added to 74\\u202fg of N,N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), as shown in Table 1 . By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50\\u202f°C (200\\u202frpm), a homogeneous casting solution was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The PET NWF were cut into 16cm\\u202f×\\u202f16cm piece and then was poured and completely wet by a 30\\u202fg/L Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF was then dried in oven at 30\\u202f°C for 0.5\\u202fh before use. The fully defoamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters 0f 14cm\\u202f×\\u202f14\\u202fcm, and then immersed into a 50\\u202f°C deionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30\\u202f°C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.3 Preparation of ZIF/PSF UF MMMs (TUF-020-d6) by direct adding method 18g of polysulfone (PSF), 6g of ZIF-8 particles, and 2g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), with a total mass of 100\\u202fg. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50\\u202f°C (200\\u202frpm), a casting suspension was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The fully de-foamed suspension was then cast onto the pristine PET NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two PTFE frames with inner diameters of 14cm\\u202f×\\u202f14cm, and then immersed into a 50\\u202f°C de-ionized (DI) water bath for 45 minutes for phase separation. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30\\u202f°C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.4 Characterization Prior to taking cross sectional images, the membrane samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ruptured to avoid excessive damage. The surface and cross sectional morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, Hitachi HITACHI, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10\\u202fkV with a thin layer of gold sputtered to improve electron conductivity. The roughness was measured using an AFM (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker, USA) using average from three 5μm\\u202f×\\u202f5μm areas selected. X-ray diffraction measurements of ZIFs were conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Thermo ARL, SCINTAGX\\'TRA) at 40\\u202fkV and 40\\u202fmA with Cu-Pb radiations. The samples were scanned in the 2θ range of 5–40° at a step size of 0.02° and a scanning speed of 0.2\\u202fsec per step. The hydrophilicity was evaluated using a contact angle measuring instrument (OCA-15EC Olympus, SZH 10). To obtain the exact contact angle for each sample, the average of five different areas was reported. Surface charges of the membranes were inspected using a zeta potential analyzer (Anton Paar SurPass 3, Austria) with the pH ranging from 3 to 10. Each datum point was averaged from three results in the same pH value. The chemical compositions of the membrane surface were estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA). The concentration of zinc ions was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Elan DRC-e, USA). The values of the concentration were obtained from the average of three random areas. BET N2 adsorption isotherm were determined using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 system at Bath Temperature of −195.850\\u202f°C. Surface area was calculated using multi-point method. 2.5 Membrane pore sizes determination The capillary pore diameter (dc) distribution were analyzed using the NV Porolux500 system, Germany. Peak sharpness could be calculated by dividing the peak height value with peak width value at half the peak height for each peak. Solute MWCO Stokes pore size distribution was determined using the method by Zhu et at [32]. The Stokes diameters of the membrane were calculated from following equation: (1) d p = 2 * 0.0397 × M 0.43 where M was the molecular weight of PEG at 90% rejection. Then the pore size distribution of the membrane was expressed as follows: (2) dR ( r p ) d r p = 1 r p ln σ p 2 Π exp [ − ( ln r p − ln μ p ) 2 2 ( ln σ p ) 2 ] where mp was the geometric mean radius of the solute at R\\u202f=\\u202f50%, and sp was geometric standard deviation, equals to the solute radius ratio at R\\u202f=\\u202f84.13% over that at 50%, obtained from modeled straight lines between R over log rs. rs, the stokes radius of PEG solutes could be calculated using following equation: (3) log rs = −1.4854 + 0.461 log Mw where, Mw was the molecular weight of PEG solute used. 2.6 Membrane permeability and retention Pure water flux (PWF) was measured using a dead-end filtration system with an effective area of 19.645\\u202fcm2\\u202fat 25\\u202f°C and 1\\u202fbar. The pure water permeating volume were taken every 15 minutes until reaching a constant value. The pure water flux (Jw1) can be calculated using the following equation. (4) J w 1 = Q A Δ t where Q was the volume of permeate water (L), A was the effective membrane area (m2), and Δt was the permeation time (h). The membrane rejection performance was determined using solutions of 0.1\\u202fg/L dyes or 1\\u202fg/L Na2SO4 after compressed at 1\\u202fbar for 1h in the feed cell. UV–Vis spectro photometers with wavelengths of 497\\u202fnm (CR), 463\\u202fnm (MO), and 662\\u202fnm (MBe) were used, respectively, to determine the dye concentrations in the feed and permeate cells. The concentration of inorganic salts were determined by electrical conductivity meter (FE 38, Mettler Toledo). The rejection ratio could be calculated by the following equation: (5) R ( % ) = ( 1 − C p C f ) × 100 % where Cp and Cf were the concentrations of the solute in the feed cell and the permeate cell, respectively. Retention selectivity of the membrane between component A over B was calculated by following formula: (6) SA/B\\u202f=\\u202fRA/RB where RA and RB refer to the rejection ratio of the membrane to component A and B respectively. All the values presented in the figures were averages from five separated measurement of different samples while the error values were the standard deviation of the five measurements. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs As shown in Fig. 1 , ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs were prepared by in-situ growing ZIF particles during the NIPS process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on PET NWF from nitrate solutions, and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As shown in Table 1, the Zn(II), PVP and 2MIM loading levels as well as NIPS time were varied to study the structures and performance of the formed TUF-MMMs. Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MBe) and methyl orange (MO) in addition to Na2SO4 were used as solutes to differentiate the filtration performance of the membranes. XRD diffraction and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analyses were performed on the membranes to confirm that the grown particles were indeed ZIF-8. The presence of ZIF particles in TUF-Zn- PVP- 2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) could be clearly proved by the characteristic peaks at 10.5 °, 12.86 °, 16.62 ° and 18.22 °in Fig. 2 a. In Fig. 2b–c, the IR peaks for SO from polysulfone at 1145\\u202fcm−1, for N–C from PVP at 1234\\u202fcm−1, together with the new peaks at 1660\\u202fcm−1 and 3487\\u202fcm−1 for CN and N–H bonds from 2MIM, and the increasing surface Zn content from XPS and EDX elemental scan (Figure S-2 and Fig. 3 in supporting information), could fully support the formation of ZIF particles in ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs. Additional XRD characterization on the ZIF particles made with and without PVP in Figure S-1, also proved that the presence of PVP did not alter the crystalline frameworks of ZIF particles. The structure and properties of TUF-PVP (TUF-020), TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320), TUF-Zn-PVP-2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) membranes were compared to reveal the unique characteristics of TUF-MMMs made from in-situ ZIF growing NIPS process. In Fig. 3 c, ZIF particles in the sizes of 200–500\\u202fnm could be observed in the surface separating layers of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs (TUF-326) not in the structures of TUF-PVP (TUF-020) and TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320). ZIF-8 particles of TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) were added directly in the casting solution and fully sealed inside the PSF matrix as shown in Fig. 3d. These agreed well with its low BET surface area values (14.73\\u202fm2/g) shown in Fig. 4 d. The in-situ formation of ZIF particles in the NIPS process had also greatly thinned the top PSF skin layers, from 937\\u202fnm (TUF-020), 893\\u202fnm (TUF-320) and 762\\u202fnm (TUF-020-d6), to 338\\u202fnm in TUF-326, leading to greatly reduced permeation resistance. In-situ formed ZIF particles in TUF-326 had fresh and open internal channels for solvent adsorption. These hydrophilic internal channels cross the fresh crystalline bodies of the embedded ZIF particles served as short-cuts for water permeating as illustrated in Scheme 1 , leading to the highest water flux value of 247\\u202fL/(m2·h) (Tables S–6, Fig. 5 c), 7.2 times higher than that of TUF-020. The internal pores of ZIF-8 particles were too small in size for N2 to penetrate, but the external surface of the formed ZIF-8 particles had added more than 2\\u202fm2/g open specific surfaces to the total available open surfaces of TUF-326 although TUF-020, TUF -320, and TUF-326 had specific surface areas in the same ranges of 40–43\\u202fm2/g in Fig. 4. Directly added pre-made ZIF-8 particles actually reduced the available adsorption specific surface area to 23.47\\u202fm2/g by altering the structure of the formed membranes, indicating very little outer surfaces of added ZIF-8 particles were available for N2 adsorption. 3.2 Superior separating performance of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs Due to the molecular sieving effect of their internal channels in the sizes of 0.30–0.34\\u202fnm, the embedded or packed ZIF-8 particles only selectively enhanced the transportation of water molecules with smaller dynamic diameters of 0.27–0.32\\u202fnm. Larger filtrate particles including dye molecules or hydrated ions could only permeate through the gaps between the particles, or the boundary voids between the particles and the PSU substrates. In the formed PSF separating layer, water molecules should see a lot of short-cuts to pass through inside the ZIF-8 particulate crystalline bodies, while the filtrates dissolved in it would see a lot of impenetrable balls blocking their movements. Inclusion of non-porous particle or particles with larger internal channels would not have the same selective effects. As illustrated in Scheme 1, multiple dimensional pores were formed on the surfaces of ZIF/PSF MMMs embedded in and packed under situ grown ZIF particles, including capillary solvent absorbing pores from the PSF matrix with the diameters of dc (80–185\\u202fnm), MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores between the ZIF particles with the gap diameters of dr (2.8–10.2\\u202fnm) and also internal water permeating pores of ZIF particles with the diameters of di (0.30–0.34\\u202fnm). As shown in Tables S–3, the longest dimension of dye molecules were in the range of 1.1–2.5\\u202fnm. Due to the existence of functional groups (–SO3 -, and –NH2) in the dye molecular structures, Donan charge effects and agglomeration of dye molecules had caused their rejections by TUF membranes with larger MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores of 2.8–10.2\\u202fnm. Therefore, ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers could promote water permeation and block solute permeation, so solute MWCO Stokes pore sizes were actually controlled by narrowest inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the separating layers had reduced capillary solvent filling diameters (dc) and solute rejection Stokes diameters (dr), and increased pore size distribution sharpness for TUF-326, resulting in improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over Na2SO4 (Fig. 5, Tables S–4). For comparison, TUF-020-d6 prepared using pre-made ZIF particles directly added in the casting solution had also shown reduced capillary absorption diameter (dc) and solute rejection diameters (dr), but with less peak sharpness. Directly added pre-made bulky ZIF-8 particles in the water of NIPS process may not be able to be effectively immobilized into the porous surfaces of formed PSF membranes while directly added bulky ZIF-8 particles in the organic phase casting solution could not migrate to the inter-phasal boundary areas during the NIPS process. They were mostly sealed inside the PSF matrix with limited open surface area and water permeating internal pores (Fig. 3d), leading to less water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity (Fig. 5c and d) than TUF-326. Only in the in situ formation process could the hydrophilic 2MIM ligand molecules be migrated to and enriched in the inter-phasal boundary areas to form exposed ZIF-balls that were embedded in or packed under the newly formed PSF porous separating layers for superior filtration performance. 3.3 Impact of preparation conditions As discussed above, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the PSF separating layer could promote both water permeation and dye retention selectivity, which could be further optimized by adjusting the parameters of the NIPS processes, including the concentrations of PVP, 2MIM and Zn(II)as well as the NIPS reaction time. Following experiments were conducted to fully illustrated the effects. 3.3.1 Effects of PVP level Membranes TUF-304, 314, 324 and 344 were prepared with the PVP loading in casting solution increased from 0, 1, 2–4\\u202fg/100ml, respectively when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18\\u202fwt%, and the content of and 2MIM in casting solution was kept at 4\\u202fg/100ml. From Fig. 8, it is clear that with the increase of the PVP content in the casting solution, capillary diameter (dc) (Fig. 8a, Tables S–8) peak value was increased from 79.6 to 107.5\\u202fnm with decreased peak sharpness. The particle sizes of ZIF-8 embedded and entrapped were kept between about 250-300\\u202fnm while the top skin thickness was kept in the range of 325–375\\u202fnm (Figs. 6–7 ). As shown in Fig. 7, the surface roughness was increased with improved hydrophilicity from more PVP loading. The water flux was gradually increased from 35.6 to 247.4\\u202fL/(m2·h) from TUF-304 to TUF-344 due to increased capillary pore sizes and surface hydrophilicity after the formation of more embedded ZIF particles. However, the solute rejection rates of the membranes were gradually decreased due to the enlarged solute rejection pore size (dr) and reduced pore distribution sharpness as shown in Fig. 8b. The retention selectivity between CR and Na2SO4 were greatly increased from 7 to 19 due to the faster reduction in Na2SO4 salt rejection rate. Balancing between the flux and rejection, PVP level was kept at 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution to have maximize MO/Na2SO4 retention selectivity for further experiments. 3.3.2 Effects of 2MIM level Membranes TUF-320, 322, 324 and 326 were prepared with 2MIM loading in casting solution increased from 0, 2, 4–6\\u202fg/100\\u202fml when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18\\u202fwt%, and the content of and PVP in casting solution was kept at 2\\u202fg/100ml. More ZIF-8 particles were formed from more 2MIM loaded, leading to improved surface hydrophilicity, decreased capillary pore diameter dc and MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter dr, and no obvious changes on surface roughness (Figs. S6–7). The in-situ growing of the ZIF particles during the NIPS process involved the migration of Zn2+, from the PET NWF to the interphasal boundary and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As discussed before, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers had reduced PSF skin thickness and provided hydrophilic internal channels to promote water permeation. As expected, when the top skin PSF layer thickness was gradually reduced from 570, 476, 337 to 275\\u202fnm with more 2MIM loading, the water flux was increased from 105.2, 127.2, 197.5–247.4\\u202fL/(m2·h) (Fig. 9 c). At the same time, the MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pore size (dr) was reduced from 14.6 to 9\\u202fnm) with increased distribution peak sharpness (Fig. 9b), leading to greatly improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts (Fig. 9c and d). The optimal concentration of 2MIM was selected at 4% when most of the Zn(II) released had been converted to ZIF particles and the retention selectivity of dyes/salt started to level off at this point as revealed in Fig. 9d. 3.3.3 The effect of Zn(NO3)2 concentration Membranes TUF-024, 324, 624 and 924 were prepared with the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution increased from 0, 30, 60–90\\u202fg/100ml, when the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9, more Zn2+ had formed more ZIF-8 particles on the membrane surfaces as well as in the separating layers while the surface skin thickness was kept in the range of 300–500\\u202fnm. Surface roughness was increased with reduced water contact angles (Fig. S10). Pre-loaded Zn (II) salts had significantly increased capillary diameter (dc) due to the accelerated diffusion of aqueous phase into organic phase driven by co-ordination reaction of Zn(II) with PVP molecules during the NIPS process. Although the capillary solvent adsorption pore sizes was increased with more Zn(II) content, the MWCO Stokes pore size was decreased with improved distribution peak sharpness. The water flux was increased due to increased capillary pore sizes while dye/salt retention selectivity was decreased due to reduced Stokes pore size (Fig. 10 ). 3.3.4 The effect of different reaction time Membranes TUF-324 samples. were prepared with varied NIPS time from 15, 30, 45–60 minutes when Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution was kept at 30\\u202fg/100ml, the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2\\u202fg/100ml in casting solution, respectively. There is no significant change in membrane surface and cross-sectional images, PSF skin thickness, surface roughness and water contact angle (Figs. S12–13). Surface capillary diameter was slightly decreased with reduced distribution peak sharpness while its MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter was decreased with increased peak distribution sharpness (Fig. S14). It is worth noting that a portion of ZIF-8 particles may have been lost during the sample preparation process, so the actual content may be more than observed in the cross-section images. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes of NIPS time (Fig. 11 ). The best NIPS reaction time should be controlled from 30-45 minutes. 3.4 Stability of membranes To test the operational efficiency of TUF membranes, the performance of TUF-324 and TUF-020 were compared in the dye/salt separation experiments using 1L solutions containing 0.1\\u202fg of CR and 1.0\\u202fg of Na2SO4 in the same mixture. The water permeance of TUF-324 was maintained in the range of 157.4 to 148.2\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar), about 7 times higher than those (23.5–19.6\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar)) of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed much higher CR/Na2SO4 retention selectivity of 15–16 than those of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed higher anti-fouling capacity than TUF-020 with less CR rejection decay over time (Fig. 12 ). 3.5 Comparison of performance of membranes with literature By comparing the filtration performance in this work with those reported in the literature, it is clear that ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with in-situ grown ZIF particles, TUF-326, 324, 624 and 924, had broken the Roberson trade-off outer bound between water permeance and retention selectivity (S) for CR/Na2SO4 [33–37], MO/Na2SO4 [38–42], MBe/Na2SO4 [38,39,43–45], bearing high potential to be used in recycling and purifying dyes for dye and textile industries (Fig. 13 ). 4 Conclusion A new strategy has been developed to prepared ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with ultra-high water permeance and improved dye/salt retention selectivity involving in-situ grown ZIF particles during the NIPS process that embedded in and packed under the thinned PSF skin layers. More PVP loading in the casting solution increased capillary pore diameter (dc), Stokes solute rejection pore diameters (dr), surface roughness and hydrophilicity, resulting in increased water permeance and dye/salt retention selectivity, and decreased solute rejection rates. More 2MIM loading in the casting solution increased ZIF particle formation, improved surface hydrophilicity, reduced PSF skin thickness, capillary diameters and Stokes solute rejection diameters, leading to increased water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts. More Zn2+ formed more ZIF-8 particles, leading to higher surface roughness and reduced water contact angles, as well as increased water flux and decreased dye/salt retention selectivity. More reaction time led to decreased solute rejection diameter. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes reaction time while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500\\u202fnm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed greatly increased water permeance, up to 250\\u202fL/(m2\\u202fh\\u202fbar), and increased rejection rates (30–99%) for dyes and dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes.

Imidazole ligands contained in casting solutions were released and reacted with divalent Zn2+ cations pre-loaded on non-woven fabric supporting layers. The capillary filling pore size and molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) Stokes solute rejection pore size of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF were tuned by varying the loading levels of Zn (II), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and imidazole, as well as the NIPS reaction time. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500 nm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed 7 times higher water permeance (up to 250 L/(m2 h bar)) and greatly enhanced dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes. Graphical abstract Tight ultra-filtration (TUF) membranes with in-situ grown zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) particles embedded in and packed under porous polysulfone (PSF) separating layers were prepared using non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) processes. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500 nm) and embedded water permeating internal channels in the ZIF particles, these membranes showed ultra-high water permeance (up to 250 L/(m2 h bar) and greatly enhanced dye rejection selectivity over salts.

Recently, membrane based separation technologies are adopted in these processes in the treatment of high-salinity textile waste water to reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and simplified operations [8–11]. Since conventional ultra-filtration (UF) membranes had too big pore sizes (0.2–0.01 mm) to retain dyes [1,12,13], and nanofiltration (NF) membranes had too small pore sizes (&lt;2 nm)for dye/salt separation, tight ultra-filtration (TUF) (or “loose” nanofiltration) membranes with pore sizes between 2 and 10 nm were developed to have high efficiency for separating dye molecules from inorganic salts [1,2]. Various processes had been developed to prepare TUF membranes. Lan [14] et al. developed nano-porous phenolic resins based TUF membranes. Chen [15] et al. improved dye retention of ceramic TUF membranes by grafting amino silanes (KH-551). Polyether sulfone (PES) and sulphonated polysulfone (SPSF) based TUF membranes were also developed for dye/salt separation [16]. However, the trade-off between water flux and dye retention selectivity, had thwarted the applications of TUF membranes [17]. There is a strong need in developing high flux TUF membranes with high dye retention selectivity. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), assembled from inorganic ions and organic ligand [18,19], bearing controllable internal water selective permeating channels to promote water permeation [20,21]. They could be grown on porous substrates by the processes of in-situ chemical, electrochemical [22], layered [23], or stepwise liquid-phase epitaxial deposition [24] to form high performance MOF membranes [25–27]. Flexible mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) could be prepared by adding ZIF particles into polymers matrices [28–31]. However, agglomeration of ZIF particles in these membranes could form non-selective defects, leading to reduced dye rejection rates. In this work, a novel strategy was developed involving in-situ growing of ZIF particles during the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on the supporting non-woven fabrics(NWF), and then reacted with 2-methimidazole (2MIM) released from the casting solutions during NIPS processes. ZIF particles were in-situ grown, embedded in and packed under the thinned polysulfone porous surface layer to promote water permeation while the molecular weight cut off (MWCO) Stokes pore sizes were effectively controlled by tuning the inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. The impact from variations in Zn (II) loading level, 2MIM content, reaction time, and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the porosity and performance of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs was systematically investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials N,N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP, ≥99.0% purity) purchased from Shanghai Taitan, Ltd. (Shanghai, China) was used as solvent and deionized water was used as non-solvent in the NIPS processes. Polysulfone (PSF, S6010) was purchased from Dongguan Haosheng Plastic Material Company and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12h before use. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, &gt;98%)) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM, Analytical Grade) were purchased from Aladdin, Shanghai. Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. Congo Red (CR), Methyl Orange (MO) and Methylene Blue (MBe) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai) Reagent Company, Shanghai Maclean Biochemical Technology Company and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent company respectively. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWF was purchased from Hangzhou Water Treatment Center. Preparation of ZIF-8 particles: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in DI water at a concentration of 1.23 g/100ml and ultrasound for 20 min. At the same time, 2MIM was dissolved in Methanol at a concentration of 0.9 g/100ml and ultrasound for 20 min. Then 2-MeIM solution were poured into zinc nitrate solution at a 1:6 volume ratio and let alone for another 12 h. The ZIF-8 particles were separated using centrifuging device, and dried at 30 °C in oven for 1 h before use. 2.2 Preparation of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs 18g of polysulfone (PSF), and various amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM) were added to 74 g of N,N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), as shown in Table 1 . By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50 °C (200 rpm), a homogeneous casting solution was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The PET NWF were cut into 16cm × 16cm piece and then was poured and completely wet by a 30 g/L Zn (NO3) 2·6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF was then dried in oven at 30 °C for 0.5 h before use. The fully defoamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters 0f 14cm × 14 cm, and then immersed into a 50 °C deionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30 °C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.3 Preparation of ZIF/PSF UF MMMs (TUF-020-d6) by direct adding method 18g of polysulfone (PSF), 6g of ZIF-8 particles, and 2g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), with a total mass of 100 g. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50 °C (200 rpm), a casting suspension was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The fully de-foamed suspension was then cast onto the pristine PET NWF at a thickness of 250 μm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two PTFE frames with inner diameters of 14cm × 14cm, and then immersed into a 50 °C de-ionized (DI) water bath for 45 minutes for phase separation. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30 °C in an oven for 40 minutes and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing. 2.4 Characterization Prior to taking cross sectional images, the membrane samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ruptured to avoid excessive damage. The surface and cross sectional morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, Hitachi HITACHI, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV with a thin layer of gold sputtered to improve electron conductivity. The roughness was measured using an AFM (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker, USA) using average from three 5μm × 5μm areas selected. X-ray diffraction measurements of ZIFs were conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Thermo ARL, SCINTAGX'TRA) at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu-Pb radiations. The samples were scanned in the 2θ range of 5–40° at a step size of 0.02° and a scanning speed of 0.2 sec per step. The hydrophilicity was evaluated using a contact angle measuring instrument (OCA-15EC Olympus, SZH 10). To obtain the exact contact angle for each sample, the average of five different areas was reported. Surface charges of the membranes were inspected using a zeta potential analyzer (Anton Paar SurPass 3, Austria) with the pH ranging from 3 to 10. Each datum point was averaged from three results in the same pH value. The chemical compositions of the membrane surface were estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA). The concentration of zinc ions was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Elan DRC-e, USA). The values of the concentration were obtained from the average of three random areas. BET N2 adsorption isotherm were determined using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 system at Bath Temperature of −195.850 °C. Surface area was calculated using multi-point method. 2.5 Membrane pore sizes determination The capillary pore diameter (dc) distribution were analyzed using the NV Porolux500 system, Germany. Peak sharpness could be calculated by dividing the peak height value with peak width value at half the peak height for each peak. Solute MWCO Stokes pore size distribution was determined using the method by Zhu et at [32]. The Stokes diameters of the membrane were calculated from following equation: (1) d p = 2 * 0.0397 × M 0.43 where M was the molecular weight of PEG at 90% rejection. Then the pore size distribution of the membrane was expressed as follows: (2) dR ( r p ) d r p = 1 r p ln σ p 2 Π exp [ − ( ln r p − ln μ p ) 2 2 ( ln σ p ) 2 ] where mp was the geometric mean radius of the solute at R = 50%, and sp was geometric standard deviation, equals to the solute radius ratio at R = 84.13% over that at 50%, obtained from modeled straight lines between R over log rs. rs, the stokes radius of PEG solutes could be calculated using following equation: (3) log rs = −1.4854 + 0.461 log Mw where, Mw was the molecular weight of PEG solute used. 2.6 Membrane permeability and retention Pure water flux (PWF) was measured using a dead-end filtration system with an effective area of 19.645 cm2 at 25 °C and 1 bar. The pure water permeating volume were taken every 15 minutes until reaching a constant value. The pure water flux (Jw1) can be calculated using the following equation. (4) J w 1 = Q A Δ t where Q was the volume of permeate water (L), A was the effective membrane area (m2), and Δt was the permeation time (h). The membrane rejection performance was determined using solutions of 0.1 g/L dyes or 1 g/L Na2SO4 after compressed at 1 bar for 1h in the feed cell. UV–Vis spectro photometers with wavelengths of 497 nm (CR), 463 nm (MO), and 662 nm (MBe) were used, respectively, to determine the dye concentrations in the feed and permeate cells. The concentration of inorganic salts were determined by electrical conductivity meter (FE 38, Mettler Toledo). The rejection ratio could be calculated by the following equation: (5) R ( % ) = ( 1 − C p C f ) × 100 % where Cp and Cf were the concentrations of the solute in the feed cell and the permeate cell, respectively. Retention selectivity of the membrane between component A over B was calculated by following formula: (6) SA/B = RA/RB where RA and RB refer to the rejection ratio of the membrane to component A and B respectively. All the values presented in the figures were averages from five separated measurement of different samples while the error values were the standard deviation of the five measurements. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs As shown in Fig. 1 , ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs were prepared by in-situ growing ZIF particles during the NIPS process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on PET NWF from nitrate solutions, and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As shown in Table 1, the Zn(II), PVP and 2MIM loading levels as well as NIPS time were varied to study the structures and performance of the formed TUF-MMMs. Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MBe) and methyl orange (MO) in addition to Na2SO4 were used as solutes to differentiate the filtration performance of the membranes. XRD diffraction and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analyses were performed on the membranes to confirm that the grown particles were indeed ZIF-8. The presence of ZIF particles in TUF-Zn- PVP- 2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) could be clearly proved by the characteristic peaks at 10.5 °, 12.86 °, 16.62 ° and 18.22 °in Fig. 2 a. In Fig. 2b–c, the IR peaks for SO from polysulfone at 1145 cm−1, for N–C from PVP at 1234 cm−1, together with the new peaks at 1660 cm−1 and 3487 cm−1 for CN and N–H bonds from 2MIM, and the increasing surface Zn content from XPS and EDX elemental scan (Figure S-2 and Fig. 3 in supporting information), could fully support the formation of ZIF particles in ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs. Additional XRD characterization on the ZIF particles made with and without PVP in Figure S-1, also proved that the presence of PVP did not alter the crystalline frameworks of ZIF particles. The structure and properties of TUF-PVP (TUF-020), TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320), TUF-Zn-PVP-2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) membranes were compared to reveal the unique characteristics of TUF-MMMs made from in-situ ZIF growing NIPS process. In Fig. 3 c, ZIF particles in the sizes of 200–500 nm could be observed in the surface separating layers of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs (TUF-326) not in the structures of TUF-PVP (TUF-020) and TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320). ZIF-8 particles of TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) were added directly in the casting solution and fully sealed inside the PSF matrix as shown in Fig. 3d. These agreed well with its low BET surface area values (14.73 m2/g) shown in Fig. 4 d. The in-situ formation of ZIF particles in the NIPS process had also greatly thinned the top PSF skin layers, from 937 nm (TUF-020), 893 nm (TUF-320) and 762 nm (TUF-020-d6), to 338 nm in TUF-326, leading to greatly reduced permeation resistance. In-situ formed ZIF particles in TUF-326 had fresh and open internal channels for solvent adsorption. These hydrophilic internal channels cross the fresh crystalline bodies of the embedded ZIF particles served as short-cuts for water permeating as illustrated in Scheme 1 , leading to the highest water flux value of 247 L/(m2·h) (Tables S–6, Fig. 5 c), 7.2 times higher than that of TUF-020. The internal pores of ZIF-8 particles were too small in size for N2 to penetrate, but the external surface of the formed ZIF-8 particles had added more than 2 m2/g open specific surfaces to the total available open surfaces of TUF-326 although TUF-020, TUF -320, and TUF-326 had specific surface areas in the same ranges of 40–43 m2/g in Fig. 4. Directly added pre-made ZIF-8 particles actually reduced the available adsorption specific surface area to 23.47 m2/g by altering the structure of the formed membranes, indicating very little outer surfaces of added ZIF-8 particles were available for N2 adsorption. 3.2 Superior separating performance of ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs Due to the molecular sieving effect of their internal channels in the sizes of 0.30–0.34 nm, the embedded or packed ZIF-8 particles only selectively enhanced the transportation of water molecules with smaller dynamic diameters of 0.27–0.32 nm. Larger filtrate particles including dye molecules or hydrated ions could only permeate through the gaps between the particles, or the boundary voids between the particles and the PSU substrates. In the formed PSF separating layer, water molecules should see a lot of short-cuts to pass through inside the ZIF-8 particulate crystalline bodies, while the filtrates dissolved in it would see a lot of impenetrable balls blocking their movements. Inclusion of non-porous particle or particles with larger internal channels would not have the same selective effects. As illustrated in Scheme 1, multiple dimensional pores were formed on the surfaces of ZIF/PSF MMMs embedded in and packed under situ grown ZIF particles, including capillary solvent absorbing pores from the PSF matrix with the diameters of dc (80–185 nm), MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores between the ZIF particles with the gap diameters of dr (2.8–10.2 nm) and also internal water permeating pores of ZIF particles with the diameters of di (0.30–0.34 nm). As shown in Tables S–3, the longest dimension of dye molecules were in the range of 1.1–2.5 nm. Due to the existence of functional groups (–SO3 -, and –NH2) in the dye molecular structures, Donan charge effects and agglomeration of dye molecules had caused their rejections by TUF membranes with larger MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores of 2.8–10.2 nm. Therefore, ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers could promote water permeation and block solute permeation, so solute MWCO Stokes pore sizes were actually controlled by narrowest inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the separating layers had reduced capillary solvent filling diameters (dc) and solute rejection Stokes diameters (dr), and increased pore size distribution sharpness for TUF-326, resulting in improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over Na2SO4 (Fig. 5, Tables S–4). For comparison, TUF-020-d6 prepared using pre-made ZIF particles directly added in the casting solution had also shown reduced capillary absorption diameter (dc) and solute rejection diameters (dr), but with less peak sharpness. Directly added pre-made bulky ZIF-8 particles in the water of NIPS process may not be able to be effectively immobilized into the porous surfaces of formed PSF membranes while directly added bulky ZIF-8 particles in the organic phase casting solution could not migrate to the inter-phasal boundary areas during the NIPS process. They were mostly sealed inside the PSF matrix with limited open surface area and water permeating internal pores (Fig. 3d), leading to less water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity (Fig. 5c and d) than TUF-326. Only in the in situ formation process could the hydrophilic 2MIM ligand molecules be migrated to and enriched in the inter-phasal boundary areas to form exposed ZIF-balls that were embedded in or packed under the newly formed PSF porous separating layers for superior filtration performance. 3.3 Impact of preparation conditions As discussed above, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the PSF separating layer could promote both water permeation and dye retention selectivity, which could be further optimized by adjusting the parameters of the NIPS processes, including the concentrations of PVP, 2MIM and Zn(II)as well as the NIPS reaction time. Following experiments were conducted to fully illustrated the effects. 3.3.1 Effects of PVP level Membranes TUF-304, 314, 324 and 344 were prepared with the PVP loading in casting solution increased from 0, 1, 2–4 g/100ml, respectively when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30 g/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18 wt%, and the content of and 2MIM in casting solution was kept at 4 g/100ml. From Fig. 8, it is clear that with the increase of the PVP content in the casting solution, capillary diameter (dc) (Fig. 8a, Tables S–8) peak value was increased from 79.6 to 107.5 nm with decreased peak sharpness. The particle sizes of ZIF-8 embedded and entrapped were kept between about 250-300 nm while the top skin thickness was kept in the range of 325–375 nm (Figs. 6–7 ). As shown in Fig. 7, the surface roughness was increased with improved hydrophilicity from more PVP loading. The water flux was gradually increased from 35.6 to 247.4 L/(m2·h) from TUF-304 to TUF-344 due to increased capillary pore sizes and surface hydrophilicity after the formation of more embedded ZIF particles. However, the solute rejection rates of the membranes were gradually decreased due to the enlarged solute rejection pore size (dr) and reduced pore distribution sharpness as shown in Fig. 8b. The retention selectivity between CR and Na2SO4 were greatly increased from 7 to 19 due to the faster reduction in Na2SO4 salt rejection rate. Balancing between the flux and rejection, PVP level was kept at 2 g/100ml in casting solution to have maximize MO/Na2SO4 retention selectivity for further experiments. 3.3.2 Effects of 2MIM level Membranes TUF-320, 322, 324 and 326 were prepared with 2MIM loading in casting solution increased from 0, 2, 4–6 g/100 ml when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30 g/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18 wt%, and the content of and PVP in casting solution was kept at 2 g/100ml. More ZIF-8 particles were formed from more 2MIM loaded, leading to improved surface hydrophilicity, decreased capillary pore diameter dc and MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter dr, and no obvious changes on surface roughness (Figs. S6–7). The in-situ growing of the ZIF particles during the NIPS process involved the migration of Zn2+, from the PET NWF to the interphasal boundary and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As discussed before, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers had reduced PSF skin thickness and provided hydrophilic internal channels to promote water permeation. As expected, when the top skin PSF layer thickness was gradually reduced from 570, 476, 337 to 275 nm with more 2MIM loading, the water flux was increased from 105.2, 127.2, 197.5–247.4 L/(m2·h) (Fig. 9 c). At the same time, the MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pore size (dr) was reduced from 14.6 to 9 nm) with increased distribution peak sharpness (Fig. 9b), leading to greatly improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts (Fig. 9c and d). The optimal concentration of 2MIM was selected at 4% when most of the Zn(II) released had been converted to ZIF particles and the retention selectivity of dyes/salt started to level off at this point as revealed in Fig. 9d. 3.3.3 The effect of Zn(NO3)2 concentration Membranes TUF-024, 324, 624 and 924 were prepared with the Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution increased from 0, 30, 60–90 g/100ml, when the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2 g/100ml in casting solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9, more Zn2+ had formed more ZIF-8 particles on the membrane surfaces as well as in the separating layers while the surface skin thickness was kept in the range of 300–500 nm. Surface roughness was increased with reduced water contact angles (Fig. S10). Pre-loaded Zn (II) salts had significantly increased capillary diameter (dc) due to the accelerated diffusion of aqueous phase into organic phase driven by co-ordination reaction of Zn(II) with PVP molecules during the NIPS process. Although the capillary solvent adsorption pore sizes was increased with more Zn(II) content, the MWCO Stokes pore size was decreased with improved distribution peak sharpness. The water flux was increased due to increased capillary pore sizes while dye/salt retention selectivity was decreased due to reduced Stokes pore size (Fig. 10 ). 3.3.4 The effect of different reaction time Membranes TUF-324 samples. were prepared with varied NIPS time from 15, 30, 45–60 minutes when Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in pre-loaded solution was kept at 30 g/100ml, the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2 g/100ml in casting solution, respectively. There is no significant change in membrane surface and cross-sectional images, PSF skin thickness, surface roughness and water contact angle (Figs. S12–13). Surface capillary diameter was slightly decreased with reduced distribution peak sharpness while its MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter was decreased with increased peak distribution sharpness (Fig. S14). It is worth noting that a portion of ZIF-8 particles may have been lost during the sample preparation process, so the actual content may be more than observed in the cross-section images. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes of NIPS time (Fig. 11 ). The best NIPS reaction time should be controlled from 30-45 minutes. 3.4 Stability of membranes To test the operational efficiency of TUF membranes, the performance of TUF-324 and TUF-020 were compared in the dye/salt separation experiments using 1L solutions containing 0.1 g of CR and 1.0 g of Na2SO4 in the same mixture. The water permeance of TUF-324 was maintained in the range of 157.4 to 148.2 L/(m2 h bar), about 7 times higher than those (23.5–19.6 L/(m2 h bar)) of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed much higher CR/Na2SO4 retention selectivity of 15–16 than those of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed higher anti-fouling capacity than TUF-020 with less CR rejection decay over time (Fig. 12 ). 3.5 Comparison of performance of membranes with literature By comparing the filtration performance in this work with those reported in the literature, it is clear that ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with in-situ grown ZIF particles, TUF-326, 324, 624 and 924, had broken the Roberson trade-off outer bound between water permeance and retention selectivity (S) for CR/Na2SO4 [33–37], MO/Na2SO4 [38–42], MBe/Na2SO4 [38,39,43–45], bearing high potential to be used in recycling and purifying dyes for dye and textile industries (Fig. 13 ). 4 Conclusion A new strategy has been developed to prepared ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with ultra-high water permeance and improved dye/salt retention selectivity involving in-situ grown ZIF particles during the NIPS process that embedded in and packed under the thinned PSF skin layers. More PVP loading in the casting solution increased capillary pore diameter (dc), Stokes solute rejection pore diameters (dr), surface roughness and hydrophilicity, resulting in increased water permeance and dye/salt retention selectivity, and decreased solute rejection rates. More 2MIM loading in the casting solution increased ZIF particle formation, improved surface hydrophilicity, reduced PSF skin thickness, capillary diameters and Stokes solute rejection diameters, leading to increased water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts. More Zn2+ formed more ZIF-8 particles, leading to higher surface roughness and reduced water contact angles, as well as increased water flux and decreased dye/salt retention selectivity. More reaction time led to decreased solute rejection diameter. Water flux was maximized at 45 minutes reaction time while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 minutes. With thinned PSF separating layer (200–500 nm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed greatly increased water permeance, up to 250 L/(m2 h bar), and increased rejection rates (30–99%) for dyes and dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes.
