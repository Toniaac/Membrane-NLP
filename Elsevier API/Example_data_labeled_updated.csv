"Versatile, facile, easy, and economical, these are the advantages that immersion precipitation or non-solvent phase separation (NIPS) offers [1-3]. Due to these, NIPS process has been regarded as the most widely-used approach in fabricating flat sheet membranes from a variety of polymers [4]. In addition, NIPS can provide a wide-range of pore size: from microfiltration to nanofiltration [5]. In this process, a polymer of choice is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Once homogeneous, the polymeric solution is cast onto a support and phase-inversion is prompted through direct immersion in a coagulation bath/non-solvent bath (typically water), generating a polymer rich phase that transforms into the membrane matrix after polymer precipitation, and a polymer lean phase which develops into pores after demixing [6].",n
"Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is amongst the most extensively used commercial membranes due to its favorable attributes such as high glass transition temperature (Tg = 190 degC), high mechanical strength, good chemical resistance over a wide-range of pH, good thermal resistance, exceptional biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication [7-9]. PSf membranes are commonly used in wastewater treatment [10-14], hemodialysis [15-17], protein purification [18-22], food processing [23], and so on. Polar solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) [1,24-27], N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [9,28-31], and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) [32-35] are usually used to dissolved PSf polymers. Utilizing these solvents to prepare PSf membranes via NIPS process generally leads to formation of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with relatively dense surface structure and porous sub-structure. Meanwhile, the cross-section of these membranes is composed of large macrovoids with walls having cellular-like structure [36] which could generate low flux due to the closed-pore structure (the pores are not interconnected with each other) that could potentially slow down the flow of water across the membrane. Additionally, concerns have been expressed on the use of such solvents to prepare polymeric membranes due to their toxicity which can cause adverse effects to our health. Besides, during NIPS process, these solvents are released into the coagulation bath during the membrane formation, and residual solvents are further extracted in the washing bath. These constitute to the release of 20-50 billion liters of contaminated water annually [1,37], and if not properly treated, can create immense damages to the environment. Hence, the use of these solvents in industries are now strictly regulated. In May 2020, the European Union has imposed a mandate on the use of NMP which has led researchers to find ""greener"" and more sustainable solvents [24,37] that have high affinity towards the PSf polymer. Alongside the prospect of tuning the morphology and suppressing macrovoids using alternative solvents.",n
"As a result of the raising interest to improve the sustainability of PSf membrane production, several different solvents have been investigated in the past with respect to their suitability for replacing harmful solvents. In recent studies conducted by Kahrs and Schwellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42] the use of utilizing 2-pyrrolidone (2P) solvent as a substitute for NMP was explored. 2P is an organic compound derived from g-butyrolactone with considerable similarities with NMP as shown in Table 1. To date, there are no known life-threatening risks accompanied by using 2P, making it a potential alternative for NMP.",n
"Standard NIPS process yield skinned asymmetric membranes with large macrovoids that could either have closed pore (cellular) structure or interconnected open pore (bi-continuous structure) [39,43]. Macrovoids are defects that grow perpendicular or near perpendicular to the skin or top layer [44]. They are large in size, and have elongated or teardrop-shaped pores ranging from 10 to 50 mm [45]. The presence of these large macrovoids can weaken the structural integrity of the membranes which can lead to breakage and total failure during operation [46]. Since the first development of phase-inversion process by Leob and Sourirajan in the 1960's [47], macrovoid formation have confounded researchers which has led to the development of different studies to understand macrovoid formation [39,44,48]. Numerous models were proposed for the formation of macrovoids. Early on, Reuvers and Smolders suggested that macrovoids were formed as the result of the nucleation of the polymer poor phase [49]. Strathmann et al. explained that the macrovoid was initiated by the rupture of the polymeric skin caused by shrinkage stress-induced-syneresis [50]. Other researchers considered that macrovoid formation stemmed from the thermodynamics aspects of chemical potential gradient [43,51-53]. Additional theories include Marangoni effects [54], solutocapillary convection mechanism [55-57], osmotic pressure [58] and combination of different mechanisms [59]. Nonetheless, several methods have been investigated to reduce macrovoid formation during immersion precipitation due to their weak mechanical strength. These include (i) choosing a solvent and non-solvent pair with low affinity towards each other; (ii) increasing the viscosity of the casting solution by increasing the polymer concentration or adding additives; and (iii) adding solvent to the coagulation bath [39,43,60-62].",n
"Although adding solvent to the coagulation bath seem to be the easiest option however, this could lead to increased production costs and pollution. The addition of additives has been the most explored strategies to mitigate the growth of macrovoids, and adding amounts of hydrophilic polymers such polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most predominant [63-65]. Some studies revealed that the addition of these hydrophilic polymers can enlarge the size of the macrovoids, while other studies reported the opposite as highlighted in the study by Sadrzadeh and Bhattacharjee [64]. These inconsistencies could be due to the fact that PVP and PEG are originally utilized as pore formers for polymeric membranes. They form pores as they leach out of the cast film upon immersion in the coagulation bath. However, depending on the molecular weights of the PVP and PEG [64], some can get trapped in the polymeric matrix. Therefore, the molecular weights of these materials have to be taken into great considerations before being used to suppress macrovoids. On the other hand, other researchers have used non-solvents such as water [24,38,39,66], ethanol [65] and other organic solvents [66,67] to control the exchange rates of the solvent and coagulant. Among these, water appear to be the most logical option due to its accessibility, abundancy, low-cost, and non-toxicity.",n
"As of this writing, there are only 4 published works on PSf/2P system. Mousavi and colleagues intensively worked on the dynamics of using 2P as a sole solvent for PSf, and a co-solvent, and how the rheology of these conditions contributed to the resulting cross-section structure of PSf membranes [41,42]. Since standard NIPS process produce ultrafiltration PSf membrane, Wang et al. in their earlier work [40], explored the use of vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process to obtain PSf membranes with highly porous surface and cross-section. Recently, Wang and colleagues observed the macrovoid initiation position in PSf/2P system prepared by NIPS process [39]. These previous works have provided initial understanding on the solvency of PSf in 2P, and on how the viscoelasticity of the casting solution affects the cross-section of PSf membranes. It is important to note that, except for the work on PSf/2P using VIPS process, the other studies only focused on the morphology of the cross-section of PSf membranes, specifically on the growth of macrovoids.",n
"This study encompasses two major objectives: (i) fabrication of highly porous PSf membranes through NIPS process using 2P as the solvent, and (ii) the suppression of macrovoid growth by using water as a non-solvent additive in the PSf/2P casting solution. Although, other studies [38,39] have previously explored the feasibility of this concept, they have not fully determined the amount of water that can be added to achieve macrovoid-free PSf membranes. Moreover, in this study, in-depth evaluations of the physical properties such morphology, porosity, pore size, permeability, and mechanical property of the PSf membranes with respect to the concentration of the additive are thoroughly carried out. Fig. 1 shows the three major parts of this study. The first part, heavily revolves on trying to understand how the nature of solvency of 2P affects the morphology of the PSf membranes, and its viability as a replacement for NMP solvent. Next, once the fundamental concepts of 2P/PSf system are established, the use of water as an additive in the casting solution to suppress macrovoids is examined. Herein, we shall probe into the viscosity of the solution, study the ternary diagram, and investigate the kinetics that took place during phase-inversion. In addition, comprehensive analysis of the physical properties of the membranes such as porosity, pore size, morphology, permeability, and mechanical properties will be examined. Lastly, the potential application of this concept will also be extended to other systems such as PSf/NMP, PSf/DMAc, and PSf/DMF to test the practicality of using water to suppress macrovoids.",n
"The polymer polysulfone (PSf, Udel(r) P-3500, Mw = 50,800 Da, Mn = 33,500 Da, r = 1.24 g/cm3) was acquired from the Amoco Performance Products Inc. (Ridgefield, CT, USA). The solvents N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, r = 1.03 g/cm3), dimethylacetamide (DMAc, r = 0.940 g/cm3) and dimethylformamide (DMF, 0.944 g/cm3) of reagent grades were purchased from Uni-Onward Corp., Taiwan, while reagent grade 2-pyrrolidinone (2P, r = 1.12 g/cm3) was procured from Acros Organics. All the chemicals were used without further purification. DI water was produced in our lab using an Elga Purelab(r) water purification system.",y
"A typical casting solution was prepared by dissolving PSf polymer in 2P solvent. To prepare the pristine casting solutions, 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf polymer were added into the 2P solvent. Meanwhile, to prepare the modified casting solutions, respective amount (wt%) of non-solvent additive (water) was added into the bottle containing 2P, and mixed well for a couple of minutes. Followed by the addition of PSf polymer. The amount of water added was determined based on the cloud point experiment (section 2.2.3). All the casting solutions were dissolved at 60 degC in an oil bath for 1-2 days. Both the casting solutions and membranes are named as Px-Dy in which x and y denote the concentrations of PSf and additive in wt%, respectively. For instance, P8-D1.5 indicates 8 wt% of PSf and 1.5 wt% of DI water. As a point of comparison with different systems, casting solutions of PSf/NMP, PSf/NMP/water, PSf/DMAc, PSf/DMAc/water, PSf/DMF, and PSf/DMF/water were also prepared.",y
"All rheological experiments of the casting solutions were evaluated on a TA instrument (Discovery HR20) using parallel plate geometry with a diameter of 20 mm (Peltier plate). All measurements were carried out at 25 degC with test duration ranging from 3 to 4 min per sample. The zero-shear viscosity of PSf/2P, PSf/2P/water, PSf/NMP and PSf/NMP/water solutions were measured at the shear rate of 10/s. Meanwhile, the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G'') of the casting solutions were measured at a constant strain rate of 2%, and monitored at angular frequency ranging from 0.5 rad/s to 628 rad/s.",n
"Once the casting solutions homogeneous, they were subsequently stored at room temperature for at least 1 day to remove some air bubbles. Then, the polymer solution was cast on a glass plate with a thickness of 300 mm. After casting, the film was immediately immersed in a water bath to permit the exchange of solvent and water, and to form the membrane. The water bath was changed at least twice. After 24 h, the membrane was dried in air at room temperature, and stored in a cool dry place for subsequent membrane characterizations.",n

Simulation of phase diagrams,n
"The phase diagrams of PSf/2P/water, PSf/NMP/water, PSf/DMAc/water systems were constructed using Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6 based on the Flory-Huggins theory. Using this software, the binodal and spinodal lines of these systems can be established which are essential in understanding their thermodynamics stability. Details of this simulation can be found from the previous work of Lai et al. [68].*Cloud point determination",n
Cloud point determination,n
"Cloud point measurements of PSf/2P/water, PSf/NMP/water, PSf/DMAc/water were determined at 60 degC wherein water was added dropwise into the homogeneous casting solutions. Local phase separation ensues upon the addition of water, but continuous stirring disrupts it, allowing uniform distribution of the non-solvent in the solution. As more water is added into the system, the cloudy state persists. Using the known concentrations of the ternary system, the composition paths can be determined on the phase diagram.*Kinetics of mass transfer during membrane formation",n
Kinetics of mass transfer during membrane formation,n
"The entailing kinetics of the phase-inversion process were observed and quantified using an optical microscope (Olympus BHT-M-113D). A drop of the casting solution was placed in between two glass slides with a 15 mm Teflon spacer. Next, a drop of water was introduced through the gap to induce phase separation. The microscope is connected to a computer that permits the recording of the phase-inversion process. The captured images were analyzed using an imaging software (Optimas 5.1, Bioscan) to measure the diffusion coefficients.",n
*Surface and cross-section morphology determination,n
Surface and cross-section morphology determination,n
"The surface and cross-section morphologies of the membranes were characterized using a Field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4000 instrument). For the membranes' cross-section, the membranes were cut while being immersed in liquid nitrogen. The membranes were laid on an electrically conductive adhesive carbon tape placed on a stainless-steel SEM holder, and vacuumed dried overnight to remove excess moisture. Prior to loading the samples in the SEM chamber, electrical conductivity of the samples was increased by sputtering platinum on the surface for 100 s. The FE-SEM analysis were conducted under an accelerating voltage of 15 keV.*Porosity and pore size evaluation",n
Porosity and pore size evaluation,n
"The porosity of the membranes was evaluated on membrane samples with a diameter of 1.2 cm. The weight of the dry membranes was first recorded before immersing them in n-butanol, which was used as the wetting liquid. After 24 h of immersion, the membranes were dabbed with a soft tissue to remove the superficial alcohol, and then weighed. Equation (1) [69,70] was then used to determine the porosity of the samples, where W2 and W1 denote the weight of the immersed membrane and of the dry membrane, respectively. r1 is the density of PSf (1.24 g/cm3), and r2 is the density of n-butanol (0.81 g/cm3). 5 independent samples were tested.(1)porosity=(W2-W1)r1r1W2+(r2-r1)W1*100%",n
"The pore size of the pristine and modified polysulfone membranes were measured using a capillary flow porometer (CFP-1500-AXLE, PMI Porous Materials, Inc). Prior to testing, 1.2 cm membranes were impregnated with isopropanol (IPA, g = 20.7 Dyne) to fill up the pores overnight. Next, the sample was loaded into the porometer metallic casing casting which was then tightly sealed. The IPA was displaced by the inert N2 gas at increasing pressures, and the pore size of the membrane was measured using the bubble point method.",n
"The mechanical strength of the membranes was evaluated using Instron 544 instrument. Sample having a dimension of 8 cm x 1 cm was loaded between the instrument's clamps which were automatically and gradually pulled apart, starting from an initial distance of 6 cm. The elongation velocity at which the clamps were separated was maintained at 10 mm/min. Stress-strain behavior was automatically measured and the procedure comes to a halt once the sample breaks.",n
"Membrane water permeability was determined in a dead-end mode using a stirred cell from Amicon(r). A membrane of 13.4 cm2 surface area was placed in the filtration module and was secured with an O-ring. The cell was then filled with 50 mL of DI water and was connected to an nitrogen tank pressure reservoir. An overpressure of 1.5 bar was applied to the system for membrane pore compaction step. Then, the pressure was decreased to 1 bar, and the weight of the water permeate was monitored using an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo) connected to a computer.",n
"The nature of the solvent plays a pertinent role in the morphology of the membranes [71]. For many years, Hansen's solubility parameters have been used as a guide in understanding the solubility of the polymer in a particular solvent. In this study, we have used equation (2a) to determine the solubility of PSf polymer in different solvents:(2a)dS-P= [(dD,S- dD,P)2 + (dP,S- dP,P)2 + (dH,S- dH,P)2]0.5Where dD, dP, and dH pertain to the van der Waals or dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding forces, respectively. The suffix S and P refer to solvent and polymer. Parameters for different PSf/solvent systems are provided in Table 2. From this, it can be inferred that out of the 3 solvents, PSf has the highest affinity towards DMF, followed by NMP, DMAc and 2P.",n
"Among the different mathematical models used to describe the thermodynamics of ternary systems, Flory-Huggins theory is the most sought after due to its relatively simple mathematical model and good accuracy of the phase behavior [72,73]. It is important to note that by constructing the ternary thermodynamics phase diagram of the phase-inversion process, we can get an insight into the composition paths of the demixed system. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (Table 3) of the systems can be estimated using the solubility parameters from Table 2, and their relationship can be transcribed to equation (3a) [73]:(3a)khi3=V1RT(d1-d2)2i=1,2where khi3 is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, V1 is the pure molar volume for component 1, and d1 is the solubility parameter for component i. Later, Hansen introduced a correction factor, a:(4)khi3=aV1RT[(d1,d-d2,d)2+0.25(d1,p-d2,p)2+0.25(d1,h-d2,h)2i=1,2",n
"Fig. 2 illustrates the ternary diagrams of (a) PSf/NMP//water and (b) PSf/2P/water. The binary interaction parameters (kh) such as PSf-2P, PSf-water, and 2P-water used in this study were similar to that of Wang's group [40]. In their work, they used the same values of khNMP-water for kh2P-water. According to their calculations (with the data of excess Gibbs free energy reported from Ref. [75]), the values of khNMP-water and kh2P-water at 40 degC are close hence, they assumed that they are also close at 25 degC. They further verified this by measuring the water compositions in the 2P/water and NMP/water when they are in equilibrium with water vapor in the humid air (25 degC, 70% relative humidity) which showed similar values of both binary interactions. Although the similarity between NMP and 2P (Table 1) is quite intriguing in spite of the increased hydrogen bonding of 2P, it was indicated by Aparicio et al. [76], that 2P supposedly favors forming cyclic dimer due to the inter-molecule hydrogen bonding. Instead of forming hydrogen bond with water, it forms a cyclic dimer that weakens its affinity towards water.",n
"In addition, the solvent-polymer interaction (khPSf-2P and khPSf-NMP) also provides a quantitative information on the degree of interaction of polymer and solvent. According to literature [72], if khpolymer-solvent is less than 0.5, the solvent has high affinity towards the polymer, and is considered a good solvent. Conversely, if it is higher than 0.5, it is regarded as a poor solvent. As shown in Tables 2 and 2P is a poorer solvent than NMP therefore, the homogeneous region of PSf/2P/water phase diagram is narrower than PSf/NMP/water. This indicates that it would take less amount of non-solvent (water) to induce demixing in PSf/2P system. The cloud points in Fig. 2 denoted the amount of water needed to demix the system. For PSf/2P system, it takes about 2 wt% of water to phase separate the solution, and as the amount of PSf in the solution is increased, it takes a lesser amount of non-solvent to induce phase-inversion. With this knowledge, we can identify how much non-solvent additive we can add into the casting solution without causing phase-inversion. Another key parameter that must be considered is the relative energy difference (RED) which provides information on whether the parameters of the two molecules (usually a polymer and solvent) are within range. This can be measured according to the following equations [2,77,78]:(5)Ro=(dD2+dP2)0.5-dH(6)Ra2=4(dD,P-dD,S)2+(dP,P-dP,S)2+(dH,P-dH,S)2(7)RED=RaRo",n
"Ro denotes the interaction radius of the polymer, and Ra refers to the solubility parameter distance. The ratio of Ra and Ro tells us that if it is < 1, the polymer is soluble in the chosen solvent, while the opposite transpires if it is > 1, and if the ratio is 1, the polymer can only be partially dissolved in the solvent. The calculated RED of the systems are 0.72, and 0.69 for PSf/2P and PSf/NMP, respectively. Hence, we can confirm that PSf polymer is soluble in 2P, and be can be used as a ""greener"" solvent replacement for NMP.",n
"Fig. 3 shows the comparison of two PSf membranes (having the same concentration) fabricated via NIPS using 2 different solvents. Left-hand figure displays the surface and cross-section morphology of the PSf membrane when NMP was used as a solvent, while the right-hand figure represents the PSf/2P system. Starting with the PSf/NMP system, a dense surface structure was obtained which is consistent with other published works [1,24-27] while, a skinned asymmetric membrane with large finger-like macrovoids extending from the top part to the bottom part of the membranes with walls having cellular-like structure was obtained. In contrast, when 2P was used as a solvent, the surface structure of the PSf membranes have obvious large pores in the microfiltration (MF) range (to be confirmed in sections 3.2 and 3.3). Meanwhile, it appears that the macrovoids were found at the deeper part of the membrane. Zoomed-in images of the membrane reveal that instead of cellular-like structure, 2P solvent generated interconnected pores or bi-continuous structure which is in agreement with the previous studies by Wang et al. [39,40] when 2P is used as a solvent.",n
"Although there are numerous studies tackling phase-inversion of casting solution to form membranes, the concept governing demixing is still tricky to understand. Many studies have suggested that if a solvent has a high affinity or high miscibility with the non-solvent, instantaneous demixing would occur. In other words, the fast exchange between the solvent and non-solvent induces the rapid precipitation of the polymer and formation of the film, within seconds of immersion in the coagulation or non-solvent bath. With this type of demixing, a highly porous cross-section (finger-like macrovoids) is obtained. On the other hand, if the solvent has a low affinity towards the non-solvent, a slow exchange occurs, which decelerates the formation of the film. Membranes with relatively dense top layer and sponge-like substructure are achieved during delayed demixing [4]. However, other studies suggest that instantaneous demixing can help mitigate the formation of macrovoids [79]. With these ambiguities in membrane formation, Hong et al. [39] studied the demixing that transpires during phase separation process.",n
"A homogeneous casting solution can be demixed through nucleation and growth (NG) or spinodal decomposition (SD) depending on the solution composition at which the phase separation occurs [80]. For the demixing to occur via NG, the phase separation composition must lie on the meta-stable or binodal region. Conversely, for SD to happen, the composition path must be found in the unstable or spinodal region. When phase-inversion happens via NG, the resulting morphology consists of nuclei of polymer-poor phase that can grow into macrovoids. Meanwhile, when phase-inversion occurs via SD, the subsequent morphology contains continuous polymer-poor phase but not nuclei type. If the demixing is accompanied by fast solvent and non-solvent exchange, the phase-inversion would typically be via SD, as evidenced by the formation of bi-continuous structure [39].",n
"It was previously stated that NMP has a high affinity towards water hence, one would assume that the exchange of solvent and non-solvent is fast enough to cause SD demixing. However, this claim contradicts our observations in Fig. 3, as cellular-like structures are observed instead of bi-continuous morphology. Meanwhile, 2P has a low miscibility towards water (possible cyclic dimer), so it is expected that phase-inversion would transpire via NG, and poorly interconnected pores on the walls of the macrovoids are to be anticipated. However, the opposite was found on both membranes. To find out why such phenomena were observed, we evaluated the viscosity of both systems as illustrated at the bottom images of Fig. 3. Due to the poorer solvency of PSf in 2P, higher viscosity is attained. For the same concentration (15 wt%), PSf/2P system has 41% higher viscosity than PSf/NMP system. This suggest that the high viscosity of PSf/2P system slowed down the solvent and non-solvent exchange which helped maintain the open porous structure and interconnected pores by mitigating the coarsening process. Conversely, NMP is a good solvent for PSf. Its high affinity for water permitted fast solvent and non-solvent exchanges, while the low viscosity (553 cP) of the system could not prevent coarsening during the phase-inversion process. So, phase-inversion may occur by SD, but the structure is not fixed and can still evolve after phase-separation. As a result, large macrovoids were observed across the membrane with cellular-like structure.",n
"As stated previously, earlier works did not explore the effect of 2P on the surface morphology of PSf membranes via NIPS process. In this study, we found out that by using 2P as solvent, we could easily obtain PSf membranes in the MF range. Normally, NIPS process generates ultrafiltration membranes as a result of the fast solvent and non-solvent exchange that transpires in the coagulation bath which typically results in the formation of a relatively dense top surface also known as skin layer [49,81-84]. Based on the study conducted by Strathmann, asymmetric morphology arises from the steep concentration, and activity gradient of the polymer, solvent and non-solvent. If the affinity of the solvent and non-solvent towards each other is high, as soon as the water is introduced on the surface of the film, the resulting chemical composition at the interface reaches in a short time a value indicating a phase separation has occurred, due to the fast mass transfer kinetics between the solvent and non-solvent. Where in fact, the internal of the film is still very far below the binodal point [85,86]. In order to slow down the exchange at the interface, additives can be introduced into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. That is why researchers commonly incorporate additives such as PEG or PVP to obtain PSf MF. To obtain PSf MF membranes, additives such PEG or PVP are added into the casting solution to increase its viscosity. However, even without additives, PSf/2P system is viscous enough (compared to PSf/NMP) to allow slower mass transfer kinetics during phase-inversion which permitted the formation of porous surface structure as shown in Fig. 4. But it is important to note that the amount of solid content would also influence the viscosity of the solution which could decrease the porosity of the membrane. Hence, it is evident in Fig. 4 that the surface porosity decreases with the polysulfone content (which will be verified later by dedicated measurements).",n
"The preceding results show that by using 2P as a solvent for PSf polymers, membrane with bi-continuous morphology in the entire cross-section can obtained. Having bi-continuous structure would be beneficial for faster permeation unlike cellular-like structure which are closed pores (not interconnected).",n
"In the introduction, we have stated the different ways to suppress macrovoid growth in polymeric membranes. Among these different approaches, adding additives into the casting solution seem to be the easiest and most economical. PVP, PEG, non-solvent, etc., are some of the most used additives to mitigate macrovoid growth. In this study, we chose water as the additive because of its abundancy and availability, cost-effectiveness, and it will not be trapped in the polymer domain (unlike polymeric additives) during the phase-inversion process. Fig. 5 shows the entire cross-section of the different membranes prepared: P8, P10, P12, and P15 which consist of 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% of PSf in 2P, respectively. The amount of water added into the casting solution was dependent on the cloud point evaluation from Fig. 2, that is to avoid phase-separation of the casting solution. For P8, the amount of DI water was varied from 0 to 1.5 wt%. Meanwhile, for P10 and P12, 0-1.0 wt% of water was added. Lastly, for P12, the concentration of DI water was from 0 to 0.8 wt%. As can be seen below, it is evident that as the concentration of PSf in the casting solution is increased (from P8 to P15), the initiation position of the macrovoid could be found deeper in the cross-section of the membranes. This can be explained by the increase in viscosity of the casting solution, which slowed down the mass transfer kinetics (this will be proven in the next section). After water was added into the casting solution of P8, it was found that the initial position of macrovoid formation appeared deeper in the cross-section of the membrane. Consequently, when more water was added (P8-D1.5), all the macrovoids were suppressed. Similar trends were observed in P8, P12 and P15, as more non-solvent is introduced in the casting solution, complete macrovoid suppression was achieved. In addition, the bi-continuous structure was well maintained in all conditions as evidenced in the SEM images in Fig. 6 which displays the higher magnification of the middle part of the cross-section. Moreover, no skin layer is observable in all PSf membranes as illustrated in Fig. S1. In contrast, it seems that the amount of additive did not directly affect the surface morphology of the membranes (Fig. S2), which all remained highly porous.",n
"It is a known fact that as the amount of solid content in the casting solution is increased, the porosity and pore size of the membranes would decrease. Therefore, a decline in the porosity and pore size of the membranes (P8 > P10 > P12 > P15) is expected, and is proven in Fig. 7. Based on this illustration, the porosity of the pristine membranes gradually decreased from 88% to 76% when the PSf concentration was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%. Likewise, the pore size was reduced from 0.65 mm to 0.30 mm. It was also apparent that the incorporation of non-solvent also resulted in a decrease in porosity and pore size of the membranes (in the same PSf concentration). The decrease in porosity of the membranes could be attributed to the disappearance of the large voids across the membranes. However, it is important to note that as the solid content is the same with and without water, we should acknowledge that porosity difference could only be due to the membrane thickness differences (Fig. S3). For a same solid content and a same thickness, the porosity should be the same, regardless of the presence of macrovoids.",n
"The viscosity of the casting solutions holds a vital role in determining the morphology of the membranes [40]. With this, we measured the viscosity of PSf/2P casting solutions and of PSf/2P/water solutions. Since the viscosity of the polymer solution is shear-rate dependent, we report in the following zero-shear viscosity. The solution viscosity logically increased with increasing polymer concentration (Fig. 8). Moreover, the viscosity tended to be low and constant below a certain concentration threshold and then drastically increased. According to polymer solution theory, there is a critical overlap concentration (C*) of polymer coils, which is the crossover concentration between the dilute and the semi-dilute concentration region. If the concentration of the polymer is below C*, the polymer clusters are segregated from each other, and it is commonly referred to as dilute regime. On the other hand, if the concentration is above C*, the solution becomes entangled as a result of the overlap between adjacent macromolecular coils. The concentration of the polymer at which the onset of significant entanglement occurs is pertained to as critical entanglement concentration (Ce), and it is within the semi-dilute entangled regime [87,88]. PSf is predominantly hydrophobic due to the large presence of aryl groups. When water is added into the system, the PSf chains will be oriented in a way that the hydrophilic segments, sulfonyl and ether groups, are exposed which was induced by hydrophobic hydration [89]. This phenomenon triggers the aryl groups to be ""coiled up or hidden"" to decrease the enthalpy of the system creating spots of cohesion entanglement among the PSf chains (as shown in the insets of Fig. 8). Moreover, as stated in the previous studies of Kahrs and Schellenbach [38], Wang et al. [39,40], Mousavi and Zadhoush [41], and Mousavi et al. [42], the addition of water into the casting solution could lead to interchain hydrogen bonding which can result in increased which can result in decreased solvent power and aggregation of the macromolecules which then induces the viscosity of the system to be enhanced. Therefore, as more water is added into the casting solution, more points of entanglement among the polymer chains are created causing the viscosity to be enhanced.",n
"By taking the straight lines used to fit the curves of the log-log plot of the zero-shear viscosity and PSf concentration (Fig. 9), we were able to determine the critical overlap concentration and the critical entanglement concentration of the casting solutions without additive, and with 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% water. In Fig. 9a, in which no additive was additive into the casting solutions, we determined that the C* is 9.7 wt%, and no onset of entanglement occurred from 2 wt% to 18 wt% (it is probable that Ce would occur at higher concentrations). However, when 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% of water were added into the casting solution, 2 things could be observed: (1) critical chain entanglement ensued; and (2) both values of C* and Ce decreased with increasing amount of additive added. Correlating these values with the SEM from Fig. 5, we can infer that the addition of water has caused the onset of chain entanglement which evidently increased the viscosity which aided in the mitigation of macrovoid growth. Also, when the polymer concentration in the casting solution is higher than the critical chain entanglement, the initiation position of macrovoids shifted to somewhere below the membrane surface. Conversely, when there is no chain entanglement (PSf-D0), macrovoids are present along the cross-section of the membrane. In addition, when more non-solvent additive is added into the casting solution, the entanglement concentration was found to decrease (increased chain entanglement), suggesting that for a much lower polymer concentration, we can fine-tune the substructure of the membrane. This can provide positive impacts in terms of fabricating membranes at a more cost-effective approach.",n
"Aside from this, we have also analyzed the viscoelastic properties of the casting solution and how it is being influenced by the addition of water. Fig. S4 presents the graph of the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G'') as a function of angular frequency. The storage modulus is a measure of the elasticity of the solution and pertains to its ability to store energy. On the other hand, the loss modulus is a measure of the viscosity of the solution and pertains to its ability to dissipate. If G'' > G' the system behaves like a liquid while if the G'' < G' behaves like a gel [87]. Based on Fig. S4, all the systems exhibit a viscous behavior. When water is added, both G' and G'' visibly increased which can be attributed to the enhanced viscosity induced by the hydrogen bonding and subsequent chain entanglement [41].",n
"Aside from probing into the thermodynamics and viscosity of the PSf/2P/water system, it is also essential to investigate the kinetics of the phase-inversion process. We observed the movement of the phase separation front of the casting solutions with varying concentrations of polysulfone under an optical microscope as depicted in Fig. 10. As it was pointed out in the previous sections of this work, higher viscosity could slow down the kinetics of the mass transfer hence, when the concentration of PSf was increased from 8 wt% to 15 wt%, it was clear that it took the non-solvent a longer time to traverse the P15 system.",n
"In fact, when comparing the position of the diffusion front as a function of time for different concentration of PSf in 2P without additives as illustrated in Fig. 11a, after 120 s of phase inversion, the non-solvent travelled a distance of 0.45 mm, 0.32 mm, 0.30 mm, 0.25 mm for P8, P10, P12 and P15, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 11b presents the related diffusion distance vs. square root of time plot.",n
"Assuming that the dark ridges found after the interface corresponds to the initial diffusion position of water, then the diffusivity of water in the system (Dw/s) can be determined based on the equation proposed by Strathmann et al. [61].(2b)d2=4(Dw/set)(1-CW1+CW)twhere d denotes the diffusion distance, e/t represents a geometrical factor for the porosity and tortuosity of the membrane being formed, CW is the water concentration at the interface between the non-solvent and the polymeric system, t pertains to time.",n
"Under the supposition that the concentration of water in the solution at the point of precipitation is small relative to unity so, equation (2b) can be simplified to the following expression (equation (3b)) to determine the effective diffusivity De. This De contains the geometrical correction factor e/t.(3b)d=2(Det)0.5",n
"With the above expression, the calculated effective diffusivity of water in P8, P10, P12 and P15 are 3.23 x 10-4, 2.60 x 10-4, 2.51 x 10-4 and 2.08 x 10-4 mm2/s, respectively. Thus, verifying our previous claim that with higher viscosity, kinetics of mass transfer was evidently slowed down.",n
"Next, the kinetics of non-solvent (water) in the PSf/2P/water casting solutions were examined and presented in Fig. 12. In P8 system, no significant trend was seen which could be attributed to the considerably lower viscosity of the system. Moreover, due to the low polymer concentration (8 wt%), the position of the system lies close to the binodal line, which makes it easier to become thermodynamically unstable. On the other hand, in P10 - P15 systems, it was evident that there is an increasing trend in the non-solvent kinetics when the amount of additive was increased. This was then further verified by calculating the diffusion rates of the non-solvent as presented in Fig. 13.",n
"In 2010, Hong et al. proposed a model for the initiation of macrovoids based on the relationship of the initial position of the macrovoid (L) and effective diffusivity (De, which is similar to diffusion coefficient) versus the normalized polymer concentration(C/Ce) [39]. According to their study, the PSf/2P, PSf/2P/water (0.5 wt%), and PSf/NMP systems can be fitted into an exponential growth curve. Similar relationship is also observed in our PSf/2P/water system as presented in Fig. S5.",n
"Although macrovoids permits fast permeability due to their high porosity, they are considered weak points in the membrane because they are prone to compaction under high pressure operation, which eventually leads to poor flux performance over time. From the previous sections, we have provided data that shows the by adding water into the casting solution, we are able to successfully mitigate the growth of these unwanted macrovoids. Moreover, we have offered in-depth analysis as to how the thermodynamics of the ternary system, kinetics and viscosity affect the morphology of the membranes. To further our study, we have investigated the effects of incorporating additives into the casting solution to help suppress macrovoids to the permeability properties and mechanical strengths of the membranes as shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.",n
"Since Figs. 4 and 5 prove that all of the fabricated membranes are suitable for microfiltration, we decided to investigate the pure water flux of the pristine and modified PSf membranes under a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar. Fig. 14 shows that even though the macrovoids disappeared, similar permeabilities are still maintained which could be due to two possible reasons: First, the additive concentration did not directly influence the surface porosity of the membranes having the same polymeric content. Second, although the huge macrovoids were suppressed, the interconnected pores along the cross-section still permitted fast permeation.",n
"Meanwhile, Fig. 15 displays the measured modulus of elasticity of the membranes obtained from tensile stress/strain plots. At the outset, it is important to note that the mechanical strength of the membrane is in correlation to the concentration of the polymer. Therefore, it is obvious that as the concentration of PSf is increased, the modulus of elasticity also increased from 40 to 130 MPa. Besides, as we increased the PSf concentration in 2P, we were also able to prevent the initiation of macrovoid growth near the top part of the membrane and then the formation of the macrovoids across the entire cross-section of the membranes. This has led to the increase in the modulus of elasticity of the modified membranes. Additionally, we compared the mechanical strength of PSf membrane prepared with 2P to that of prepared using NMP (Fig. S6). As expected, the large macrovoids found in PSf/NMP membranes acted as weak spots which contributed to it having lower tensile strength.",n
"To summarize, using 2P as a solvent allowed the easy fabrication of PSf MF (skin-free) membranes through NIPS process, which is deemed difficult to achieve using other solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc without the addition of additives. However, macrovoids are still present along its cross-section. The addition of a sufficient amount of water (which content is dependent upon the phase diagram) permits to totally suppress the macrovoids without sacrificing the pore size and porosity of the membranes. So, skin-free and macrovoids-free PSf membranes can be prepared using 2P as the solvent and water as a non-solvent additive. As the pore connectivity is maintained, so is the membrane permeability. But as the morphology of the cross-section is no longer asymmetric with large macrovoids, instead replaced with symmetric with continuous connected domains, the mechanical strength of the membranes was enhanced without waiving the permeability. These findings could help provide an easy and economical approach to suppress macrovoids without using expensive organic or inorganic additives, or using intricate methods to fabricate macrovoid-free membranes. Fig. 16 illustrates the short summary of these results.",n
"To evaluate the viability of using non-solvent as an additive to suppress macrovoids, we have utilized other solvents such NMP DMAc and DMF to prepare polysulfone membranes. We initially established their respective ternary diagrams (Fig. 2 for PSf/NMP/water and Fig. 17 for PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water) to first identify up to how much water could be added into the casting solution before phase separation occurs. Based on the solubility parameters from Table 1, DMF and DMAc solvents are also considered good solvents to PSf polymer. This is also evidenced by the large homogeneous area of PSf/DMAc/water and PSf/DMF/water ternary systems illustrated in Fig. 17. Moreover, the cloud points also revealed that it would take more coagulant (water) to induce demixing of the system.",n
"In order to find out the versatility of the water as a means to prevent macrovoid formation, we have prepared 25% of PSf in NMP, 20% of PSf in DMAc, and 15% of PSf in DMF via the NIPS process. We have varied the concentrations of the additive from 0 to 3 wt% for PSf/NMP, 0-2 wt% for PSf/DMAc and 0-1 wt% for PSf/DMF casting solutions. The SEM cross-section images in Fig. 18 reveal that when water was added into the casting solution of PSf/NMP, the macrovoids were effectively suppressed. Similar phenomena were observed in PSf membranes prepared using DMAc (Fig. 19a) and DMF (Fig. 19b) solvents. These results prove that using water as an additive in the casting solution provides a practical and cost-effective approach to tune the morphology of polysulfone membranes from controlling the growth of macrovoids to its overall suppression.",n
"In this study we first investigated the use of 2P solvent to prepare polysulfone membranes in replace of the more commonly used NMP solvent. Being a poorer solvent than NMP, the nature of solvency of 2P greatly influenced the kinetics, viscosity, and thermodynamics stability of the system. The following major conclusions can be made:*The fabricated membranes are skin-free and fall in the microfiltration range.*The lower affinity of 2P towards polysulfone (compared to NMP) greatly increased the viscosity of the casting solution which prevented coarsening. As a result, bi-continuous substructures were formed. However, macrovoids were still observed.*The higher concentrations of the polymer prompted the growth of the macrovoids along the deeper parts of the membranes.",n

"After understanding the effects of 2P on the morphology of the membranes, the second part of this study focused on tuning the cross-section morphology to obtain macrovoid-free membranes through the incorporation of water in the casting solution of PSf/2P. The following inferences can be made:*The addition of water caused the viscosity of the system to further increase which consequently influenced the rate of solvent and non-solvent exchange, and then affected the demixing of the solution.*Adding water in the casting solution induced the polymer chains to be entangled causing the macrovoid to be shifted deeper along the cross-section of the membranes.*The modified membranes maintained high porosity (>75%) and large pore size which are still suitable for microfiltration applications.*Even though the macrovoids were successfully mitigated, high water permeability was still achieved, as interconnected pores were retained.*Through the suppression of macrovoids, the mechanical properties of the membranes were drastically improved.*Water as an additive provided a very simple yet effective approach to suppress the macrovoids not just for PSf/2P system but also for PSf/NMP, PSf/DMAc, and PSf/DMF systems.",n

"Membrane materials stand at the core of membrane separation technology. As the basis of membrane materials, porous membranes are not only widely used in such fields as ultrafiltration, membrane distillation and membrane crystallization, but also can be used as the base membrane of reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, gas separation and other composite membranes. At present, the main research direction of porous membranes is to enhance the mechanical strength, permeability and fouling resistance [1-3].",n
"Nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) is the most established approach for fabricating porous polymer membranes [4,5]. The integration of pore formers (i.e., additives) into dope solutions is one of the most common and effective methods to regulate the permeability of porous membranes [4-7]. However, the excessive addition of pore formers can negatively impact the pore size and mechanical strength of the resulting porous membranes [8,9].",n
"For the method of regulating the permeability by adding additives, the trade-off existing between thermodynamic and kinetic of dope solutions is a very common phenomenon [10]. In NIPS, facilitating the mutual diffusion of water (coagulant) and dope solutions (MDWDS) during the membrane formation process has been acknowledged as an effective method to prepare porous membranes with higher water flux.",n
"Surfactants are considered to be unique additives due to amphiphilic structure [11,12]. Though adding surfactants into dope solutions has been reported in many previous studies, their general focus has been on the effect of surfactant contents on the morphology and properties of porous membranes as shown in Table 1 with the influence of the amphiphilic structure of surfactants on MDWDS being rarely reported. Recent studies revealed that the surfactants at the interface of polymer solutions and water could facilitate MDWDS during NIPS, thus obtaining separation membranes with higher water flux [22,27-29]. For example, Guo et al. [22] added octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (OP-10, a kind of nonionic surfactant) into dope solutions and found that OP-10 at the polymer/water interface facilitated the diffusion of water into dope solution, thus improving MDWDS. Wang et al. [27] investigated the key role of Pluronic F127 in the forming process of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes and found that Pluronic F127 promoted MDWDS, thus accelerating the phase separation process.",n
"The permeability of porous polymer membranes in these studies was enhanced in varied degrees. Nevertheless, the pore size and tensile strength of the membranes were compromised due to the research method was still the effect of addition amounts of surfactants on the properties and morphology of polymer porous membranes. This arouses extreme zeal for us to further modify NIPS-prepared porous membranes against enlarged pore size and lowered mechanical strength, and eventually improve the efficiency in the preparation process.",n
"Therefore, we propose a method capable of improving water flux while maintaining the pore size and tensile strength of porous membranes via alteration of the conventional NIPS process. Aiming at MDWDS during NIPS, an amphiphilic interface via the addition of surfactants was created. The well-organized interface facilitated MDWDS across the interface (Fig. 1 (b)). Our previous study indicated that the hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic polymer and the hydrophobic tails of surfactants had great influence on the MDWDS process. Hence, we controlled other possible variables but only changed the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants [29]. The influence of the hydrophilic interaction force on the formation process of membranes prepared by NIPS was thoroughly investigated. This type of phase separation (PS) process with the assistance of self-assembled surfactant is herein called as surfactants assisted nonsolvent induced phase separation (SA-NIPS). Compared with the conventional methods to improve water flux, the addition amounts of surfactants is always 2.0 wt.%, which may have very limited negative effects on the pore size and tensile strength of porous membranes [21]. We believe that this study not only can help to reveal the key role of surfactants during membrane formation of NIPS, but also help researchers to have a deeper understanding of NIPS process, thus preparing a porous membrane with better performance.",n

"IHN refers to the number of water molecules surrounding an ion [30]. When ionic surfactants are dissolved in solvents, their hydrophilic heads dissociate into ions [31]. Hence, IHN was used to represent the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants at the water/dopes interface. Four typical surfactants with different hydrophilic heads but similar hydrophobic ends are selected, namely, ammonium, carboxylate, sulfonate, and sulfate surfactants. IHN of the surfactants used in this paper is in referenced [30] and listed in Table 2. IHN in the references was obtained by X-ray diffraction methods.",n
The cloud points were determined by conventional titration method [13]. Homogeneous polymer solutions with different PSF concentration and additives (PEG and surfactants) in DMAc were prepared by stirring for 5 h at 343.15 K. Deionized water was added dropwise into the dope solutions under constant agitation by using pipette until perpetual turbidity was observed. The cloud points were noted when the turbidity of the dope solutions did not disappear for at least 30 min. The composition of the cloud points was obtained by the amount of deionized water.,n
"Digital Viscometer (NDJ-8S, Shanghai Jinghai Instrument Co., LTD.) was used to measure the dopes viscosity. The testing was implemented using a sample container under shear rate of 12.0 rpm at 298.15 K. For each of the solutions, at least five measurements were made and the average values are showed in Table 2.",n
"Polymer solutions with PSF, PEG-4000, and different surfactants were prepared using DMAc as solvent and then was stirred at least 5 h at 343.15 K. The homogenous dope solutions were degassed at 343.15 K until no air bubbles existed. The homogenous dope solutions were evenly casted on a glass plate. Then, the glass plate was promptly immerged into coagulant (water) at 298.15 K. The resulting membrane was then reserved in tap water to clear out the remaining additives and solvent. The detailed compositions of the dope solutions are showed in Table 2.",y
"Dope solution was evenly filled into a special flat beaker with at a 3 mm depth. The beaker was then immersed into water bath at 298.15 K. The Shore rubber hardness tester (TH220, Libo instrument Co. LTD, China) was used to measure the real-time hardness value of dope solution [28,29]. The dope solution was considered to have completely solidified when the real-time value ceased to increase. This time was recorded to as the solidification time of dope solution. Here, the thickness of dope solution tested is far beyond the real thickness of membrane, and the measurement objective of the solidification time is to indicate the change of the kinetics of phase separation.",n
"A scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Group, Oberkochen, Germany) was used to observe the surface and cross-sectional structure of the PSF membranes. Dried membrane samples were evenly sputter-coated with gold-palladium. Image-Pro-Plus 7.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA) software was used to measure the surface porosity of membranes. At least four testing were carried out for one data point and the average value was recorded [32,33]. A gas-liquid porometer (Porolux 1000), purchased from Porometer Co., LTD (Belgium), was utilized to measure the bubble point pore size and pore size distribution. Porewick with 16 dyn/cm was used to saturate the pores of PSF membranes.",n
"The surface roughness of dry membranes was characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Dimension Icon SPM, Bruker, USA) in AC tapping mode. Scanning on upper surfaces of membranes was done in an area of 5 x 5 mm using a SCANASYST-AIR model tip (Bruker, USA). The contact angle meter (Harke Speca, Japan) was utilized to test the static contact angle of the membrane surfaces in air. The samples were initially dried for 48 h at 35  to remove the moisture. An average of five measurements at different positions for each membrane sample were taken at room temperature and the average value recorded.",n
"The surface chemistry of the PSF membranes was characterized by using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectrometer (ATR-FTIR) (Vector-22, Germany). The spectra were collected at room temperature with a resolution of 4 cm-1.",n
"Porosity was estimated using the gravimetric method, which was calculated according to Eq. (1):(1)e=(Ww-Wd)/rW(Ww-Wd)/rW+Wd/rpx100%where rp is the density of polymer (i.e., PSF). Ww is the wet weight of PSF membranes, rw = 1.0 g cm-3, Wd is the dry weight of PSF membrane.",n
"The tensile strength of dry membranes was measured using electronic strength tester (YG061F/PC, Laizhou electron instrument Co., LTD, China) at room temperature. The membranes were cut into pieces measuring 10 cm by 2 cm before testing. The ends of samples were clamped and then stretched at a constant tensile rate of 600 mm/min.",n
"The separation performance testing of membranes was conducted using a dead-end filtration system [34]. The actual permeate area was 12.56 cm2. The first testing was the evaluation of the permeability of PSF membranes. First, each membrane was compacted at 0.20 MPa for 20 min to obtain steady state. Then the transmembrane pressure was adjusted to 0.10 MPa and controlled by using a pressure valve. The pure water flux (PWP) was evaluated at 0.10 MPa and calculated according to Eq. (2):(2)PWP=DVA*twhere ^V is the volume of permeated water (L), A is the actual permeation area (m2), t is the operation time (h).",n
"The second testing was the evaluation of the rejection of membranes. The feed solution was 0.1 gL-1 solution of BSA. The ultraviolet spectrophotometer (TU-1810 UV), purchased from Beijing Purkinje General Instrument co. LTD (China), was utilized to measure the concentrations of BSA in the filtration and feed solutions at a wavelength of 280 nm. The rejection (R) was calculated using the following equation:(3)R=(1-CpCf)x100%where Cp and Cf are the concentrations of BSA in the filtration and feed solutions, respectively.",n
"Fig. 2(a) illustrates the phase diagram for PSF/DMAc/water system and the influence of surfactants with different hydrophilic heads on the cloud point. Results show that the cloud point curves are pretty much unaffected by the addition of a small quantity (2.0 wt%) of different surfactants into polymer solution. This indicated that the addition of surfactants with different hydrophilic heads does not greatly impact the thermodynamics of the system [13,35].",n
"The viscosities of dope solutions, which can influence the exchange rate of water and dope solutions during NIPS process, are shown in Fig. 2(b). For this reason, the molecular weight of surfactants used in this study are close to each other and less than 1000 Da, and the addition amounts of surfactants in dope solutions is constant (2.0 wt%). As expected, the addition of small molecule surfactants with different hydrophilic heads does not significantly affect the viscosity of dope solutions.",n
"However, notable change in the kinetics of PS is observed in Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(c) shows that the addition of surfactants is found to decrease the solidification time compared to PSF-O due to surfactant is amphiphilic which can improve MDWDS [22,27-29]. Interestingly, the solidification time further decreases as the IHN of surfactants increases. Surfactants used in the current work are hydrocarbon surfactants, that is, the hydrophobic interaction between hydrophobic polymer and the hydrophobic tails of surfactants remains unchanged. The coagulation bath used here is tap water at 298.15 K. Hence, the only variable in this study is the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants, which may account for the trend in Fig. 2(c). This is because surfactants will directionally align at the water/dope interface with the hydrophilic heads toward the polar phase (water) and the hydrophobic tails toward the non-polar phase (dope solutions) to minimize the interfacial free energy. The surfactants attract water into dope solutions by hydrophilic interaction. This can improve the exchange rate of dope solutions and water during NIPS process. The hydrophilic interaction force between water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants is then altered as the hydrophilic heads of surfactants are modified [31,36,37], eventually affecting the MDWDS. With the heightened hydrophilic interaction force between water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants (i.e., with the increase of the surfactant IHN in Fig. 2(c)), the surfactants attract water into the dope solution faster and efficiently. Hence, MDWDS is further facilitated. Kinetically, it can be concluded from Fig. 2(c) that the solidification time further decreases as the IHN of surfactants increases.",n
"The addition of surfactants into dope solutions has been reported in numerous previous studies, but they were added to improve the water flux of membrane by empirically increasing the addition amounts of the surfactants into dope solutions. This approach normally has obvious negative influences on the pore size and mechanical strength of the fabricated membranes. Notably, the regulation of MDWDS in NIPS by changing the hydrophilic heads of surfactants has not been reported before. Herein, this process is denoted ""surfactants assisted nonsolvent induced phase separation"" (SA-NIPS). SA-NIPS offers an essentially different viewpoint about the influence of surfactants on the MDWDS and the overall PS process.",n
"Fig. 3 presents the SEM images of the upper surface morphology of the PSF membranes prepared without (PSF-O) and with different surfactants. Fig. 3 indicates that the upper surface of the virgin PSF membrane (PSF-O) is relatively dense, which would inhibit permeability. However, SA-NIPS increases the pore number on the upper surface of PSF membranes (i.e., IHN = 4, 6, 9 and 12) at various degrees.",n
"In order to reveal the key role of surfactant IHN during the surface pore formation of PSF membranes, Image J software is utilized to quantify the surface porosity of PSF membranes. As expected, Fig. 4 indicates that the surface porosity of the PSF membranes increased with an increase of surfactant IHN. This is because as the IHN increased (i.e., with the elevation the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants), the surfactants attracted more water into dope solution. This process opens up the dope solution interface (i.e., played a pore-forming role at the interface), thus splitting PSF dope solution into more and smaller PSF rich-phase. Hence, the MDWDS is further facilitated (Fig. 2(c)). This phenomenon normally increases the surface porosity of polymer membranes [28,29,38,39].",n
"In general, the surface roughness of porous membranes changes as surface porosity changes. Hence, the upper surface roughness of the PSF membranes was studied by AFM. Table 3 shows that the mean surface roughness increased with an increase of the IHN. This is because increasing the IHN improved the surface porosity of PSF membranes, which led to the formation of a rougher surface [28,40].",n
"The hydrophilicity of PSF membranes was measured via static water contact angle method. It can be observed in Table 3 that the contact angle of the PSF membranes varied negligibly. This is because the post-treatment technology in this research (see Section 2.4) eliminated all traces of the additives (surfactants and PEG) and solvent. To support this deduction, ATR-FTIR spectra of the upper surfaces of the PSF membranes were collected. For all samples, there are no the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups at 3300 cm-1 in Fig. 5, indicating the remaining additives (surfactants and PEG) were cleared out. This also implied SA-NIPS doesn't affect the surface hydrophilicity of PSF membranes.",n
"The cross-sectional images of PSF membranes are displayed in Fig. 6. All PSF membranes show a representative asymmetric morphology, composed of a skin-layer supported by elongated finger-like voids. The PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS displayed somewhat wider finger-like voids in the sub-layers in comparison with the virgin PSF membranes (PSF-O). The size of finger-like voids somewhat increased as the increase of the IHN. The phenomenon can be ascribed to the faster MDWDS during NIPS [23,29]. In other words, the size of finger-like voids somewhat increased as the increase of the rate of MDWDS (i.e., solidification time decreases in Fig. 2(c)).",n
"Effects of surfactant IHN on the pure water flux of PSF membranes is displayed in Fig. 7. The virgin PSF membrane demonstrated the lowest pure water flux of 282 L m-1h-1bar-1 due to the dense upper surface of PSF-O (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that pure water flux improved with the increase of surfactant IHN as expected, which is attributed to the increase in surface porosity (Fig. 4). Compared to the virgin PSF membrane (PSF-O), the pure water flux of the PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS increased by a maximum of 2.9 times.",n
"There are multiple techniques used to characterize membrane pore size, such as mercury intrusion method, bubble-point method, solute rejection measurements and so on [40]. Though pore size data generated from each of these methods is different, there is a common association among them. In view of this, bubble-point method and solute rejection measurements were used to investigate the influence of the IHN on the pore size of PSF membranes.",n
"Fig. 8(a) shows that both BSA rejection method and bubble-point method indicate that the addition of surfactants into dope solutions and the increase of surfactant IHN do not markedly influence the BSA rejection and bubble-point pore size of PSF membranes. This is because the dominating factors affecting pore size of polymer membranes [28,39] are the kinds and quantities of the main pore-forming additives and the membrane material concentration, etc. In this work, the dominating factors are almost constant, and the only variable is the small addition (2.0 wt.%) of surfactants with low molecular weight (less than 1000 Da). This indicates that the surfactants in the work primarily function as improving the pore numbers of PSF membrane. The pore size of PSF membrane is mostly determined by macromolecular additives such as PEG. It suggests that increasing the IHN of surfactants can significantly improve the pure water flux of PSF membrane, but not significantly affect the membrane pore size.",n
"For porous membranes, the peak of pore size distribution is close to the maximum pore size of membrane indicating the enhancement of the membrane sieving performance [28,29]. Fig. 8(b) displays the pore size distribution of PSF membranes, measured by pore size analyzer based on gas/liquid displacement method. The peak of pore size distribution located from 0.019 mm to 0.022 mm, indicating that SA-NIPS does not dramatically impact the pore size of PSF membranes. Specifically, the peak of pore size distribution shifted to the maximum pore size with the increase in surfactant IHN, indicating the pore size distribution of PSF membranes was optimized.",n
"Porosity measured by the gravimetric method is negatively correlated with the mechanical strength of porous membranes [41,42]. Obvious increase in porosity can lower the mechanical strength of porous membranes. Hence, the porosity of the PSF membranes is investigated, and displayed in Fig. 9(a). The porosity of the virgin PSF membrane (PSF-O) was 85.7%, which was a little higher than that of the PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS. The porosity of the PSF membranes prepared by SA-NIPS showed no obvious change with the increase of the IHN. This indicates SA-NIPS does not affect the porosity of PSF membranes obviously.",n
"Fig. 9(b) shows the elongation and tensile strength of PSF membranes. The tensile strength of PSF membranes did not considerably change. Several factors, such as the kinds and adding amounts of main pore-forming additives, membrane material concentration, etc., are known to influence the tensile strength of membranes [39,40]. These factors are kept constant in this work and the only variable is the addition of trace amount (2.0 wt.%) of surfactants with low molecular weight (less than 1000 Da). This further indicates that the proposed method solves the trade-off bottleneck in which increasing membrane flux by adding additives into dope solutions results in lower the mechanical strength of polymer membranes.",n
"Herein, we reported that the membrane formation process of NIPS was successfully modified by adjusting the hydrophilic interaction force of water and the hydrophilic heads of ionic surfactants for the first time, thus successfully preparing PSF membranes with more through-pores. Elevating the hydrophilic interaction force between water and the hydrophilic heads of surfactants (i.e., increasing the IHN of surfactants) was conducive for the surfactants to efficiently attract more water into dope solutions, eventually promoting MDWDS during NIPS. This process increased the surface porosity and optimized the pore size distribution of the membranes. It was observed that the water flux of as-prepared membranes was significantly increased (up to 2.9 times increase, maximumly). Due to the addition of small amounts of surfactants with low molecular weight, the proposed method improved the water flux of PSF membrane without lowering the tensile strength and enlarging pore size of porous membranes markedly. Other testing results showed that the surface roughness increased slightly and the pure water contact angle was not significantly affected. This research on the pore-forming mechanism of surfactants is still in the preliminary stage, and there are still many shortcomings. However, it may provide some new ideas for the preparation of high-performance porous membranes.",n

"In the last decades, wastewaters have resulted in a huge damage to the nature due to releasing to the environment with no suitable treatment. Hence, state-of-the-art and sustainable water purification techniques are necessary for addressing the water scarcity issue, producing potable water from polluted water, and saving the ecosystem from pollution [12,49]. The conventional treatment strategies proved not to be efficient for the elimination of pollutants. Membrane-based methods have shown a high efficiency while consuming lower energies than the conventional ones, e.g., distillation [13,48]. Nowadays, nanofiltration (NF) has been applied in different industries, e.g., wastewater treatment, as a promising route. It has proved satisfactory in separation and purification of different mixtures in a wide range of applications, e.g., food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries, arising from its low investment cost, low energy demand and significant separation efficiency [27,50].",n
"In the recent decade, several phase inversion methods have been widely utilized the fabrication of mixed matrix membranes, including non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS), temperature-induced phase separation (TIPS), and vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS). Among them, the NIPS method is considered as the oldest strategy extensively utilized in the preparation of numerous polymeric membranes [4,7,8]. Nevertheless, it is well-known that this process leads to the formation of membranes with macro-voids [17,43], considered as a big issue in this field of study. Hence, the VIPS method has emerged as a new strategy to overcome this drawback. In this approach, during the exposure of the membrane to the vapor medium, because a slow mass transfer of water is occurred from the vapor phase to the casting solution, a uniform spongy structure is created in the membrane with no macro-voids [3,31,44]. As an example, it was reported by Su et al. that after the formation of polysulfone membranes using the VIPS approach, a completely cellular morphology was formed by applying a relatively long exposure time [19,24,51]. Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning that the coupled VIPS-NIPS strategy has been also employed in recent years to prepare novel membranes. In these systems, the non-solvent is often water, and so, the phase separation can be promoted via the water vapor transfer. The vapor's role is so crucial in the polymer precipitation, which is completed in the non-solvent bath [23].",n
"Polysulfones, which are categorized as thermoplastic polymers, has been widely employed in the production of the membranes for separation technology, arising from their low cost and ease of processing, and thermal and chemical stability [9]. Polysulfone (PSf) is an extensively utilized material for membrane fabrication while polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) is a relatively new polymer having extraordinary properties in comparison to the more frequently applied PSF and polyethersulfone (PES). PPSU provides superior impact strength than PSF and PES. It is also significantly chemical resistant, and shows a remarkably low rate of water absorption, making it appropriate for applications involving superheated steam sterilization and alkali washing. It also possesses excellent dimensional stability and superb resistance to high-energy radiation and heat. All these properties make PPSU a promising candidate for design of novel membranes [35,36]. Nevertheless, no examples have been reported of the application on membranes based on PPSU in industry, originating from its low flux. For example, pristine ultrafiltration PPSU membranes prepared using the NIPS method provide very low water flux of 0-10 L.m-2.h-1 at 0.1 MPa [29]. The low flux of PPSU membranes can be attributed to the restriction of the variation of casting solution composition because of low miscibility of PPSU with commonly utilized pore-forming additives (polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinypyrrolidone (PVP)) in aprotic amide solvents (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) etc.) [34]. Accordingly, it is an urgent need to modify PPSU membranes for the purpose of enhancing their separation performance, hydrophilicity and antifouling resistance for practical applications. One of the strategies to enhance membrane separation and antifouling performance is blending, which can be done through the introduction of hydrophilic water-soluble polymers and oligomers to the PPSU casting solution, surfactants, low molecular weight substances, inorganic nanoparticles, and metal organic frameworks [26,35,42]. The incorporation of additives has proven so efficient, which is usually done through the incorporation of three different types of additives: (a) inorganic additives, e.g., ZnO [41], SiO2 (Sonawane et al., 2022), TiO2[33], and MOFs [20]; (b) organic additives, e.g., PVP and PEG copolymers (Vidal et al., 2021; Falahati et al., 2019), GO (Tantiwatcharothai et al., 2020), MWCNT [45], and surfactants [11]; (c) additives as the non-solvent, e.g., H2O (Javanbakht et al., 2020), di-alcohols [28], and alcohols [30].",n
"Polysaccharides can be extracted from a variety of sources, including plants, such as cellulose, microorganisms, such as dextran, seaweeds, such as carrageenan, animals, such as chitosan, and seeds [21]. Basil seed, a tiny black seed which is native to different countries in Asia, i.e., Iran and India, is made up of three major components possessing various molecular weights, including polysaccharides (92%), proteins (2.37%), and uronic acids (6.51%) [33,41]. When the seeds are soaked in water, their outer pericarp swells into a hydrogel, which is called mucilage [32]. Because of the fact that basil seeds are easily available with a low price, the fabrication of each gram of mucilage is done by a lower price when compared to that of synthetic polymers [37].",n
"In this research work, neat and mixed matrix polyphenylsulfone-polysulfone membranes incorporated with basil seed mucilage hydrogel were prepared using the VIPS-NIPS technique, in which 1,4-dioxane was utilized as the co-solvent. Membranes with sponge-like morphology with small macro-voids were formed. BSM was used in this study due to its significant hydrophilicity, leading to a considerable enhancement in the flux performance of the mixed matrix membranes. Different mucilage hydrogel contents were incorporated into the membranes to fabricate a variety of membranes with different properties, and achieve a membrane possessing outstanding performance in terms of rejecting different dyes.",n
"Basil seeds were supplied via Reyhan Gum Parsian, Iran. Commercial polyphenylsulfone (PPSU, Ultrason P3010 MR; Mw=35,000 g.mol-1) and polysulfone (PSf, Ultrason(r) 6010 P) were supplied via BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; k30), direct yellow, and Methyl Green were obtained from Merck, Germany. Methylene blue, 1,4-benzendicarboxylic acid, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, and Crystal Violet were supplied by PubChem.",y
"Here, for enhancing the basil seeds purity, impurities washed away with DI water and ethanol, consecutively, and then, the seeds dried at 25 degC. Next, the purified basil seeds were soaked in DI water at 25 degC for 40 min, leading to swelling their outer layer as a gelatinous layer around the seeds. After that, in order to improve the extraction efficiency, NaOH solution (2%wt.) was added drop-wise into the BSM mixture solution under stirring until adjusting pH to 8, which was conducted for 9 h at 70 degC, after which the extracted BSM and the seeds were completely separated from each other. Eventually, using decantation and centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 20 min, BSM was separated. The mucilage hydrogel extraction process is shown in Scheme 1.",y
"First, for the fabrication of the mixed matrix membranes, different amounts of the BSM hydrogel were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane/PVP mixtures, followed by sonication for 2 h to prepare homogeneous mixtures. In the next step, PPSf/PSf with a concentration of 18 wt% was added into the as-prepared mixtures and completely dissolved after continuously stirring at RT for 24 h. The homogenous polymer solution was de-gassed using a desiccator apparatus for 30 min and cast on a glass plate in a climatic box (relative humidity of 65 +- 5% and temperature 40 degC) for 10 s using a Doctor Blade device with a gap of 200 um (the VIPS step), and then, transferred to coagulation bath (the NIPS step). Finally, the prepared membranes were taken out of the bath and kept in DI water until conducting the separation tests. The neat membrane was also prepared by the same method, except that no BSM was added to the polymer mixture. The composition of casting solutions are exhibited in Table 1.",y
"Scheme 2 shows the dead-end filtration set-up used for determining both the rejection and flux performance. For determining the flux performance, DI water was added to the above-mentioned cell and permeated under the pressure of 7 bar. Then, flux was determined using Eq. 1, as follows:(1)F=VAxtWhere A, V, t, and F are ascribed to the effective surface area (m2), the permeate volume (L), the test time interval (h), and flux (L.m-2.h-1).",n
"Dyes rejection performance was also studied via adding a 30 ppm dye/water solution to the dead-end cell, followed via permeating under N2 gas pressure (7 bar; 25 degC).",n
"Dyes rejection of the neat and mixed matrix membranes were also determined via Eq. 2, as follows:(2)R=CF-CPCFx100%Where CF, R, and Cp are the feed solution concentration, the dye rejection percentage, and the permeate solution concentration, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the permeate solution concentration was evaluated by investigating its lmax using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo, Biomate5, USA).",n
"BET analysis, Belsorp mini II, Japan, was done to determine the extracted mucilage hydrogel pore size. The hydrogel was also investigated with FT-IR (Perkin Elmer-spectrum 65); Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; TA, Q600, USA); XRD analysis (PHILIPS, PW1730, Netherland) ranged in 2O = 5-90deg; and FESEM, EDS and SEM Mapping analyses (TESCAN, MIRA III). The neat and mixed matrix polyphenylsulfone-polysulfone membranes were also investigated by ATR FT-IR (Bruker, Tensor 27, Equinox 55); AFM analysis (NT-MDT, semi-contact mode); XRD analysis (Diffractometer D8, SIEMENS) ranged in 2O = 10-80deg; FESEM, EDS and SEM Mapping analyses (TESCAN, MIRA III); and static water contact angle (WCA, Dataphysics, OCA 15 plus);.",n
"Fig. S1a exhibits the FT-IR spectrum related to the chemical structure of the extracted mucilage hydrogel. Based on the spectrum, the peaks emerged at 1096, 1165, 1248, 1455 and 1644 cm-1, corresponding to the CO and COC stretching vibrations of the glycosidic linkage in polysaccharides, C-H vibration, and the symmetric and asymmetric COO stretching vibrations, respectively [47]. Additionally, there are also two peaks which have emerged at 1535 and 1746 cm-1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric CO stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups, respectively. Furthermore, the peaks appeared at 2854, 2935 and 3006 cm-1 are also related to the CH absorption, CH2 bending, and CH stretching vibrations, respectively [11]. Also, the board peak at 3100-3500 cm-1 correspond to the alcohol -OH groups.",n
"Crystallinity of the extracted mucilage hydrogel was evaluated by XRD analysis (Fig. S1b), based on which it can be discerned that the mucilage hydrogel is an amorphous natural polymer, which can be demonstrated by the broad peak emerged at 2th = 12-28deg [14,22].",n
"TGA analysis was done to study the thermal stability of the extracted mucilage hydrogel (Fig. S2a). Accordingly, it can be seen that the TGA curve shows a four-step decomposition by raising temperature from 0deg to 800degC. The first weight loss step has appeared at 60-150 degC, which is owing to the moisture and solvent elimination. The second weight-loss step is observed at the temperature range of 250-350 degC, which is because of the decomposition of both the hemicellulose polysaccharides and glycosidic links of cellulose [46]. The third weight-loss step and the fourth one have also appeared at the temperature ranges of 360-470 degC and 480-600 degC, which are originated from the decomposition of the cellulose and lignin, respectively [45]. Based on the above-mentioned results, the mucilage hydrogel can be stable in the reactions with the temperature of < 150 degC.",n
"The pores characteristics of the extracted BSM, BET analysis was performed in terms of evaluating the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. S2b). It is demonstrated by the results that BSM has a mesoporous structure by having a type IV isotherm with H4-type hysteresis loops (IUPAC classification) [10]. Furthermore, it was indicated that BSM has the BET surface area (as,BET) of 1.09 m2/g, pore volume of 0.27 cm3/g and mean pore diameter of 5.57 nm. Additionally, based on the BJH curve, the pores in the BSM structure mostly have the radius of 1.86 nm.",n
"EDX and SEM Mapping analyses were also conducted to investigate the elemental structure and the elements distribution, respectively, in the extracted BSM (Fig. S3). According to the EDX analysis, it is indicated that BSM is composed of three different elements, i.e., N, C, and O, in which the C and O elements content is dominant. SEM Mapping analysis also indicates that the elements have a good dispersion in the BSM structure.",n
"SEM analysis was also done to study the morphology of the extracted mucilage hydrogel (Fig. 1). Based on Fig. 1, it is discernible that the hydrogel has not only a rough surface with large wrinkles but also some network structures. Based on the literature, this morphology is able to considerably enhance the direct dye rejection [18].",n
"Fig. 2a exhibits the FTIR spectra of the PSf/PPSU, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.1, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 and PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 membranes. Based on Fig. 2a, it can be discerned that two strong peaks have emerged around 1493 and 1560 cm-1 in all the spectra, corresponding to the aromatic vibrational bonding of CC in the PSf and PPSU backbones. Moreover, it is also obvious that strong peaks have emerged at 1158 and 1233 cm-1 in all the spectra, which are ascribed to the vibrational bonding of C-O-C and OSO, respectively, in the PSf and PPSU backbones. Additionally, the peaks appeared around 3041 and 2966 cm-1 are attributed to the vibrational =C-H bonding in the aromatic ring of PSf and PPSU backbones and the aliphatic vibrational -C-H bonding of the PSf backbone, respectively [6,25]. Also, two peaks have appeared around 1310 and 1320 cm-1, corresponding to the vibrational region of the sulfone group [30]. By drawing a comparison between the neat and mixed matrix membranes, it can be found that most of the peaks of BSM and those of the membrane matrix have overlapped. Nevertheless, the broad peak appeared at 3100-3400 cm-1 is attributed to the hydroxyl groups of BSM, which confirms the successful incorporation of BSM into the membranes matrix.",n
"XRD analysis was done to evaluate the crystalline nature of the fabricated neat and mixed matrix membranes. Based on Fig. 2b, a broad peak has appeared around 2th= 18deg, which corresponds to the amorphous nature of both polyphenylsulfone and polysulfone [2,39]. Additionally, the peaks corresponding to the MMMs have been broadened somewhat, arising from the incorporation of the mucilage hydrogel between the polymeric chains. It is also noteworthy that the hydrogel broad peak, at about 2th = 20deg, has overlapped with the strong broad peak of the matrix, and therefore, it is not distinguishable.",n
"The elemental analysis was done using EDX analysis, as depicted in Fig. S4. Accordingly, it is clear that the neat membrane is only composed of C, O, and S elements, while the mixed matrix membranes are composed of C, O, S, and N elements, strongly demonstrating the successful incorporation of BSM hydrogel. Furthermore, it is clear that the more the BSM content has increased, the more the N wt% has increased in the composition.",n
"The surface FESEM images of PSf/PPSU, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.1, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2, and PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 are exhibited in Fig. 3. Accordingly, it can be seen that the neat membrane has a uniform surface without any hydrogel and impurities. By the incorporation of the BSM hydrogel into the mixed matrix membranes matrix, the BSM hydrogel has also appeared on the surface of the modified membranes. Furthermore, the more the BSM content hydrogel increased, the more hydrogels have been loaded on the membranes surface. It is also worth noting that the hydrogel has been dispersed uniformly on the membranes surface, enhancing their efficiency in separation performance.",n
"SEM-Mapping analysis was conducted to investigate the elemental distribution on the surface of the PSf/PPSU and PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 membranes (Fig. 4). It is clear from the images that all the elements are distributed uniformly on the surface of the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 membrane, demonstrating good dispersion of the BSM hydrogel. Moreover, the appearance of the N element on the surface of the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 membrane confirms the successful incorporation of the BSM hydrogel in the matrix of the membrane.",n
"The high- and low-magnification cross-sectional FESEM images of PSf/PPSU, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.1, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2, and PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 are shown in Fig. 5. Accordingly, it can be seen in low-magnification images that the neat and modified membranes are made up of an asymmetric morphology with finger-like structures because of employing considerable DMF concentration in the dope solution [40]. Additionally, based on high-magnification images, the neat and modified membranes are also comprised of an open cellular spongy morphology, because in the VIPS-NIPS route, a slower absorption of water molecules occurs in comparison with the NIPS one, delaying the phase inversion process, and so, results in the creation of a sponge-like morphology [38].",n
"It is also obvious that the finger-like pores are larger in the neat membrane structure in comparison to those of the modified membranes. Furthermore, the more the BSM content increases, the more the finger-like pores size decreases, indicating that the phase separation slows down by increasing the BSM content [5]. This can be attributed to the increase in viscosity of the polymer casting solution through increasing the BSM content (0.8, 0.89, 0.97, and 1.18 Pa.s corresponding to the PSf/PPSU, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.1, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2, and PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 samples, respectively), leading to a decrease in water molecules diffusion through the polymer matrix. According to the literature, the increased viscosity of the casting solution takes the part of a physical roadblock against the mass transfer between non-solvent and solvent, by which a delayed demixing occurs during the membrane preparation process [52].",n
"The roughness parameters of the PSf/PPSU, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.1, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 and PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 membranes were evaluated by conducting the AFM analysis (5 umx5 um). According to Fig. 6, roughness of the mixed. Moreover, in the mixed matrix membranes, by increasing the BSM content, roughness has also increased. Table S1 also shows the roughness parameters in terms of ten-point average roughness, average roughness (Ra), root mean square (Rq), and height difference between the highest peak and the lowest valley (Ry). Accordingly, it can also be demonstrated that by incorporating BSM, the roughness parameters have also increased. Additionally, it is worth pointing out that the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 membrane possesses a much higher roughness than the other membranes because of the great BSM content incorporated in the membrane matrix [1].",n
"To evaluate the effect of the incorporated BSM on the hydrophilicity of the prepared mixed matrix membranes, contact angle analysis was performed, as shown in Fig. 7. according to the literature, the more the hydrophilic nature, the less the contact angle [16,26]. Accordingly, it is easily discernible that by incorporating BSM into the membrane matrix, hydrophilicity has significantly enhanced. The more BSM has incorporated into the membrane matrix, the more CA has decreased [15,28]. All these findings are in a complete accordance with the enhancement in the mixed matrix membranes flux.",n
"The prepared membranes performance was investigated in terms of flux and dye rejection ability, as exhibited in Fig. 8. It is discernible that the neat membrane sample has provided lower rejection and flux in comparison to the mixed matrix membranes. After the addition of BSM, both rejection and water flux have been greatly enhanced. Although the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 sample provided a lower flux than the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 membrane sample, it showed the highest rejection performance, and therefore, it was selected as the optimum membrane.",n
"Long-term stability of the optimum membrane, i.e., PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2, was studied in terms of evaluating flux and dye rejection performance of the membrane after running the experiments for ten days (Fig. 9). Accordingly, as can be observed, the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 sample could provide a superb dye rejection performance with negligible changes after long periods. Additionally, flux exhibited negligible decline owing to dilution and fouling effect. All these observations indicates great long-term stability of the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 sample in terms of both flux and dye rejection, which showed negligible deterioration by passing time.",n
"In this step, the dynamic fouling trend of the BSM hydrogel-incorporated membranes was evaluated in terms of their flux change throughout the alternative filtration of pure water and BSA solution. Based on Fig. 10, it can be found that all of the modified membranes could provide much higher fluxes (water flux, BSA solution flux and water flux after cleaning) than the unmodified membrane. When the pure water was replaced via the BSA solution in the filtration cell, flux of all the membranes decreased. The protein flux reduction compared to the pure water flux of the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 membrane was lower than that of the neat membrane, which demonstrated less fouling tendency of the modified membranes in comparison to the unmodified one. After the protein filtration, the flux recovery property of the membranes was evaluated through determining their subsequent pure water flux, as shown in Fig. 11. After the water cleaning process, the PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.1, PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.2 and PSf/PPSU@BSM 0.5 membranes recovered around 89%, 96% and 94% of their primary water flux, respectively, while the unmodified membrane recovered only 75% of its initial flux, indicating that the cleaning action had affected the BSM hydrogel-incorporated membranes with more efficiency. The outstanding fouling resistance with BSM hydrogel loadings could happen owing to the increased hydrophilicity of the modified membranes, which could prevent the undesired adhesion of hydrophobic foulants because of the formation of a thin water layer.",n
"Here, basil seed mucilage hydrogel was incorporated in mixed matrix blend membranes containing polyphenylsulfone/polysulfone using the VIPS-NIPS strategy, by which membranes with sponge-like morphology with small macro-voids were formed. BSM was utilized in this study due to its significant hydrophilicity, leading to a considerable enhancement in the flux performance of the mixed matrix membranes. Different mucilage hydrogel contents were incorporated in the membranes to fabricate a variety of membranes with different properties, and achieve a membrane possessing outstanding performance in terms of rejecting different dyes. By drawing a comparison between the neat and the mixed matrix membranes, it was found that excellent rejection performance and water flux were achieved after the incorporation of BSM. Long-term durability of the membrane containing 0.2 wt% BSM also demonstrated that after ten days, dye rejection and flux performance showed negligible changes.",n

"Effective treatments of waste waters are highly desired for many industries [1,2], including dye and textile industries, in which dye molecules were separated and recycled by methods including electro-chemical separation, adsorption and deposition [3-7]. Recently, membrane based separation technologies are adopted in these processes in the treatment of high-salinity textile waste water to reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and simplified operations [8-11]. Since conventional ultra-filtration (UF) membranes had too big pore sizes (0.2-0.01 mm) to retain dyes [1,12,13], and nanofiltration (NF) membranes had too small pore sizes (<2 nm)for dye/salt separation, tight ultra-filtration (TUF) (or ""loose"" nanofiltration) membranes with pore sizes between 2 and 10 nm were developed to have high efficiency for separating dye molecules from inorganic salts [1,2].",n
"Various processes had been developed to prepare TUF membranes. Lan [14] et al. developed nano-porous phenolic resins based TUF membranes. Chen [15] et al. improved dye retention of ceramic TUF membranes by grafting amino silanes (KH-551). Polyether sulfone (PES) and sulphonated polysulfone (SPSF) based TUF membranes were also developed for dye/salt separation [16]. However, the trade-off between water flux and dye retention selectivity, had thwarted the applications of TUF membranes [17]. There is a strong need in developing high flux TUF membranes with high dye retention selectivity.",n
"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), such as zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), assembled from inorganic ions and organic ligand [18,19], bearing controllable internal water selective permeating channels to promote water permeation [20,21]. They could be grown on porous substrates by the processes of in-situ chemical, electrochemical [22], layered [23], or stepwise liquid-phase epitaxial deposition [24] to form high performance MOF membranes [25-27]. Flexible mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) could be prepared by adding ZIF particles into polymers matrices [28-31]. However, agglomeration of ZIF particles in these membranes could form non-selective defects, leading to reduced dye rejection rates.",n
"In this work, a novel strategy was developed involving in-situ growing of ZIF particles during the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on the supporting non-woven fabrics(NWF), and then reacted with 2-methimidazole (2MIM) released from the casting solutions during NIPS processes. ZIF particles were in-situ grown, embedded in and packed under the thinned polysulfone porous surface layer to promote water permeation while the molecular weight cut off (MWCO) Stokes pore sizes were effectively controlled by tuning the inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. The impact from variations in Zn (II) loading level, 2MIM content, reaction time, and amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the porosity and performance of the formed ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs was systematically investigated.",n

"Preparation of ZIF-8 particles: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in DI water at a concentration of 1.23 g/100 ml and ultrasound for 20 min. At the same time, 2MIM was dissolved in Methanol at a concentration of 0.9 g/100 ml and ultrasound for 20 min. Then 2-MeIM solution were poured into zinc nitrate solution at a 1:6 vol ratio and let alone for another 12 h. The ZIF-8 particles were separated using centrifuging device, and dried at 30 degC in oven for 1 h before use.",y
"18 g of polysulfone (PSF), and various amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 2-methylimidazole (2MIM) were added to 74 g of N,N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), as shown in Table 1. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50 degC (200 rpm), a homogeneous casting solution was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The PET NWF were cut into 16cm x 16 cm piece and then was poured and completely wet by a 30 g/L Zn (NO3) 2*6H2O aqueous solution. After removal of excess liquid, the solution loading weight was measured for the calculation of Zn (NO3)2 loading. The Zn (II)-loaded NWF was then dried in oven at 30 degC for 0.5 h before use. The fully defoamed cast solution was then cast onto the Zn (II)-loaded NWF at a thickness of 250 mm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) frames with inner diameters 0f 14cm x 14 cm, and then immersed into a 50 degC deionized (DI) water bath for a certain time for phase separation. During the phase separation process, 2MIM from the casting solution and Zn2+ from NWF were continuously ligated to form ZIF-8 NPs in the PSF matrix. In the end, the formed mixed matrix membrane was dried at 30 degC in an oven for 40 min and then sealed and stored in DI-water for testing.",y
"18 g of polysulfone (PSF), 6 g of ZIF-8 particles, and 2 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP), with a total mass of 100 g. By continuous stirring in an oil bath at 50 degC (200 rpm), a casting suspension was obtained and then stand still overnight to be fully de-foamed. The fully de-foamed suspension was then cast onto the pristine PET NWF at a thickness of 250 mm using a coating machine. The coated film was then clamped into two PTFE frames with inner diameters of 14cm x 14 cm, and then immersed into a 50 degC de-ionized (DI) water bath for 45 min for phase separation.

"Prior to taking cross sectional images, the membrane samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ruptured to avoid excessive damage. The surface and cross sectional morphology were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, Hitachi HITACHI, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV with a thin layer of gold sputtered to improve electron conductivity.",n
"The roughness was measured using an AFM (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker, USA) using average from three 5mm x 5 mm areas selected. X-ray diffraction measurements of ZIFs were conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Thermo ARL, SCINTAGX'TRA) at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu-Pb radiations. The samples were scanned in the 2th range of 5-40deg at a step size of 0.02deg and a scanning speed of 0.2 s per step.",n
"The hydrophilicity was evaluated using a contact angle measuring instrument (OCA-15EC Olympus, SZH 10). To obtain the exact contact angle for each sample, the average of five different areas was reported. Surface charges of the membranes were inspected using a zeta potential analyzer (Anton Paar SurPass 3, Austria) with the pH ranging from 3 to 10. Each datum point was averaged from three results in the same pH value. The chemical compositions of the membrane surface were estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA). The concentration of zinc ions was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Elan DRC-e, USA). The values of the concentration were obtained from the average of three random areas. BET N2 adsorption isotherm were determined using a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 system at Bath Temperature of -195.850 degC. Surface area was calculated using multi-point method.",n
"The capillary pore diameter (dc) distribution were analyzed using the NV Porolux500 system, Germany. Peak sharpness could be calculated by dividing the peak height value with peak width value at half the peak height for each peak.",n
Solute MWCO Stokes pore size distribution was determined using the method by Zhu et at [32]. The Stokes diameters of the membrane were calculated from following equation:(1)dp=2*0.0397xM0.43where M was the molecular weight of PEG at 90% rejection.,n
"Then the pore size distribution of the membrane was expressed as follows:(2)dR(rp)drp=1rplnsp2Pexp[-(lnrp-lnmp)22(lnsp)2]where mp was the geometric mean radius of the solute at R = 50%, and sp was geometric standard deviation, equals to the solute radius ratio at R = 84.13% over that at 50%, obtained from modeled straight lines between R over log rs.",n
"rs, the stokes radius of PEG solutes could be calculated using following equation:(3)log rs = -1.4854 + 0.461 log Mwwhere, Mw was the molecular weight of PEG solute used.",n
"Pure water flux (PWF) was measured using a dead-end filtration system with an effective area of 19.645 cm2 at 25 degC and 1 bar. The pure water permeating volume were taken every 15 min until reaching a constant value. The pure water flux (Jw1) can be calculated using the following equation.(4)Jw1=QADtwhere Q was the volume of permeate water (L), A was the effective membrane area (m2), and Dt was the permeation time (h).",n
"The membrane rejection performance was determined using solutions of 0.1 g/L dyes or 1 g/L Na2SO4 after compressed at 1 bar for 1 h in the feed cell. UV-Vis spectro photometers with wavelengths of 497 nm (CR), 463 nm (MO), and 662 nm (MBe) were used, respectively, to determine the dye concentrations in the feed and permeate cells. The concentration of inorganic salts were determined by electrical conductivity meter (FE 38, Mettler Toledo). The rejection ratio could be calculated by the following equation:(5)R(%)=(1-CpCf)x100%where Cp and Cf were the concentrations of the solute in the feed cell and the permeate cell, respectively. Retention selectivity of the membrane between component A over B was calculated by following formula:(6)SA/B = RA/RBwhere RA and RB refer to the rejection ratio of the membrane to component A and B respectively.",n
All the values presented in the figures were averages from five separated measurement of different samples while the error values were the standard deviation of the five measurements.,n
"As shown in Fig. 1, ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs were prepared by in-situ growing ZIF particles during the NIPS process. The central divalent cations, such as Zn2+, were pre-loaded on PET NWF from nitrate solutions, and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As shown in Table 1, the Zn(II), PVP and 2MIM loading levels as well as NIPS time were varied to study the structures and performance of the formed TUF-MMMs. Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MBe) and methyl orange (MO) in addition to Na2SO4 were used as solutes to differentiate the filtration performance of the membranes.",n
"XRD diffraction and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analyses were performed on the membranes to confirm that the grown particles were indeed ZIF-8. The presence of ZIF particles in TUF-Zn- PVP- 2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) could be clearly proved by the characteristic peaks at 10.5deg, 12.86deg, 16.62deg and 18.22 degin Fig. 2a. In Fig. 2b-c, the IR peaks for SO from polysulfone at 1145 cm-1, for N-C from PVP at 1234 cm-1, together with the new peaks at 1660 cm-1 and 3487 cm-1 for CN and N-H bonds from 2MIM, and the increasing surface Zn content from XPS and EDX elemental scan (Figure S-2 and Fig. 3 in supporting information), could fully support the formation of ZIF particles in ZIF/PSF TUF-MMMs. Additional XRD characterization on the ZIF particles made with and without PVP in Figure S-1, also proved that the presence of PVP did not alter the crystalline frameworks of ZIF particles.",n
"The structure and properties of TUF-PVP (TUF-020), TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320), TUF-Zn-PVP-2MIM (TUF-326) and TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) membranes were compared to reveal the unique characteristics of TUF-MMMs made from in-situ ZIF growing NIPS process. In Fig. 3c, ZIF particles in the sizes of 200-500 nm could be observed in the surface separating layers of ZIF/PSF TUF MMMs (TUF-326) not in the structures of TUF-PVP (TUF-020) and TUF-Zn-PVP (TUF-320). ZIF-8 particles of TUF-PVP-ZIF (TUF-020-d6) were added directly in the casting solution and fully sealed inside the PSF matrix as shown in Fig. 3d. These agreed well with its low BET surface area values (14.73 m2/g) shown in Fig. 4d.",n
"The in-situ formation of ZIF particles in the NIPS process had also greatly thinned the top PSF skin layers, from 937 nm (TUF-020), 893 nm (TUF-320) and 762 nm (TUF-020-d6), to 338 nm in TUF-326, leading to greatly reduced permeation resistance. In-situ formed ZIF particles in TUF-326 had fresh and open internal channels for solvent adsorption. These hydrophilic internal channels cross the fresh crystalline bodies of the embedded ZIF particles served as short-cuts for water permeating as illustrated in Scheme 1, leading to the highest water flux value of 247 L/(m2*h) (Tables S-6, Fig. 5c), 7.2 times higher than that of TUF-020.",n
"The internal pores of ZIF-8 particles were too small in size for N2 to penetrate, but the external surface of the formed ZIF-8 particles had added more than 2 m2/g open specific surfaces to the total available open surfaces of TUF-326 although TUF-020, TUF -320, and TUF-326 had specific surface areas in the same ranges of 40-43 m2/g in Fig. 4. Directly added pre-made ZIF-8 particles actually reduced the available adsorption specific surface area to 23.47 m2/g by altering the structure of the formed membranes, indicating very little outer surfaces of added ZIF-8 particles were available for N2 adsorption.",n
"Due to the molecular sieving effect of their internal channels in the sizes of 0.30-0.34 nm, the embedded or packed ZIF-8 particles only selectively enhanced the transportation of water molecules with smaller dynamic diameters of 0.27-0.32 nm. Larger filtrate particles including dye molecules or hydrated ions could only permeate through the gaps between the particles, or the boundary voids between the particles and the PSU substrates. In the formed PSF separating layer, water molecules should see a lot of short-cuts to pass through inside the ZIF-8 particulate crystalline bodies, while the filtrates dissolved in it would see a lot of impenetrable balls blocking their movements. Inclusion of non-porous particle or particles with larger internal channels would not have the same selective effects. As illustrated in Scheme 1, multiple dimensional pores were formed on the surfaces of ZIF/PSF MMMs embedded in and packed under situ grown ZIF particles, including capillary solvent absorbing pores from the PSF matrix with the diameters of dc (80-185 nm), MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores between the ZIF particles with the gap diameters of dr (2.8-10.2 nm) and also internal water permeating pores of ZIF particles with the diameters of di (0.30-0.34 nm).",n
"As shown in Tables S-3, the longest dimension of dye molecules were in the range of 1.1-2.5 nm. Due to the existence of functional groups (-SO3-, and -NH2) in the dye molecular structures, Donan charge effects and agglomeration of dye molecules had caused their rejections by TUF membranes with larger MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pores of 2.8-10.2 nm. Therefore, ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers could promote water permeation and block solute permeation, so solute MWCO Stokes pore sizes were actually controlled by narrowest inter-particulate spaces of the embedded and packed ZIF particles. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the separating layers had reduced capillary solvent filling diameters (dc) and solute rejection Stokes diameters (dr), and increased pore size distribution sharpness for TUF-326, resulting in improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over Na2SO4 (Fig. 5, Tables S-4).",n
"For comparison, TUF-020-d6 prepared using pre-made ZIF particles directly added in the casting solution had also shown reduced capillary absorption diameter (dc) and solute rejection diameters (dr), but with less peak sharpness. Directly added pre-made bulky ZIF-8 particles in the water of NIPS process may not be able to be effectively immobilized into the porous surfaces of formed PSF membranes while directly added bulky ZIF-8 particles in the organic phase casting solution could not migrate to the inter-phasal boundary areas during the NIPS process. They were mostly sealed inside the PSF matrix with limited open surface area and water permeating internal pores (Fig. 3d), leading to less water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity (Fig. 5c and d) than TUF-326. Only in the in situ formation process could the hydrophilic 2MIM ligand molecules be migrated to and enriched in the inter-phasal boundary areas to form exposed ZIF-balls that were embedded in or packed under the newly formed PSF porous separating layers for superior filtration performance.",n
"As discussed above, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the PSF separating layer could promote both water permeation and dye retention selectivity, which could be further optimized by adjusting the parameters of the NIPS processes, including the concentrations of PVP, 2MIM and Zn(II)as well as the NIPS reaction time. Following experiments were conducted to fully illustrated the effects.",n
"Membranes TUF-304, 314, 324 and 344 were prepared with the PVP loading in casting solution increased from 0, 1, 2-4 g/100 ml, respectively when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30 g/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18 wt%, and the content of and 2MIM in casting solution was kept at 4 g/100 ml. From Fig. 8, it is clear that with the increase of the PVP content in the casting solution, capillary diameter (dc) (Fig. 8a, Tables S-8) peak value was increased from 79.6 to 107.5 nm with decreased peak sharpness. The particle sizes of ZIF-8 embedded and entrapped were kept between about 250 and 300 nm while the top skin thickness was kept in the range of 325-375 nm (Figs. 6-7).",n
"As shown in Fig. 7, the surface roughness was increased with improved hydrophilicity from more PVP loading. The water flux was gradually increased from 35.6 to 247.4 L/(m2*h) from TUF-304 to TUF-344 due to increased capillary pore sizes and surface hydrophilicity after the formation of more embedded ZIF particles. However, the solute rejection rates of the membranes were gradually decreased due to the enlarged solute rejection pore size (dr) and reduced pore distribution sharpness as shown in Fig. 8b. The retention selectivity between CR and Na2SO4 were greatly increased from 7 to 19 due to the faster reduction in Na2SO4 salt rejection rate. Balancing between the flux and rejection, PVP level was kept at 2 g/100 ml in casting solution to have maximize MO/Na2SO4 retention selectivity for further experiments.",n
"Membranes TUF-320, 322, 324 and 326 were prepared with 2MIM loading in casting solution increased from 0, 2, 4-6 g/100 ml when the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate pre-loading solution was kept at 30 g/L, the concentration of PSF was kept at 18 wt%, and the content of and PVP in casting solution was kept at 2 g/100 ml. More ZIF-8 particles were formed from more 2MIM loaded, leading to improved surface hydrophilicity, decreased capillary pore diameter dc and MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter dr, and no obvious changes on surface roughness (Figs. S6-7).",n
"The in-situ growing of the ZIF particles during the NIPS process involved the migration of Zn2+, from the PET NWF to the interphasal boundary and then reacted with the 2MIM released from the PSF casting solutions during NIPS processes. As discussed before, in-situ formed ZIF particles embedded in and packed under the surface separating layers had reduced PSF skin thickness and provided hydrophilic internal channels to promote water permeation. As expected, when the top skin PSF layer thickness was gradually reduced from 570, 476, 337 to 275 nm with more 2MIM loading, the water flux was increased from 105.2, 127.2, 197.5-247.4 L/(m2*h) (Fig. 9c). At the same time, the MWCO Stokes solute rejecting pore size (dr) was reduced from 14.6 to 9 nm) with increased distribution peak sharpness (Fig. 9b), leading to greatly improved dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts (Fig. 9c and d). The optimal concentration of 2MIM was selected at 4% when most of the Zn(II) released had been converted to ZIF particles and the retention selectivity of dyes/salt started to level off at this point as revealed in Fig. 9d.",n
"Membranes TUF-024, 324, 624 and 924 were prepared with the Zn(NO3)2*6H2O in pre-loaded solution increased from 0, 30, 60-90 g/100 ml, when the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2 g/100 ml in casting solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9, more Zn2+ had formed more ZIF-8 particles on the membrane surfaces as well as in the separating layers while the surface skin thickness was kept in the range of 300-500 nm. Surface roughness was increased with reduced water contact angles (Fig. S10).",n
"Pre-loaded Zn (II) salts had significantly increased capillary diameter (dc) due to the accelerated diffusion of aqueous phase into organic phase driven by co-ordination reaction of Zn(II) with PVP molecules during the NIPS process. Although the capillary solvent adsorption pore sizes was increased with more Zn(II) content, the MWCO Stokes pore size was decreased with improved distribution peak sharpness. The water flux was increased due to increased capillary pore sizes while dye/salt retention selectivity was decreased due to reduced Stokes pore size (Fig. 10).",n
"Membranes TUF-324 samples. were prepared with varied NIPS time from 15, 30, 45-60 min when Zn(NO3)2*6H2O in pre-loaded solution was kept at 30 g/100 ml, the concentration of 2MIM, PSF and PVP was kept at 4, 18 and 2 g/100 ml in casting solution, respectively. There is no significant change in membrane surface and cross-sectional images, PSF skin thickness, surface roughness and water contact angle (Figs. S12-13). Surface capillary diameter was slightly decreased with reduced distribution peak sharpness while its MWCO Stokes solute rejection diameter was decreased with increased peak distribution sharpness (Fig. S14). It is worth noting that a portion of ZIF-8 particles may have been lost during the sample preparation process, so the actual content may be more than observed in the cross-section images. Water flux was maximized at 45 min while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 min of NIPS time (Fig. 11). The best NIPS reaction time should be controlled from 30 to 45 min.",n
"To test the operational efficiency of TUF membranes, the performance of TUF-324 and TUF-020 were compared in the dye/salt separation experiments using 1 L solutions containing 0.1 g of CR and 1.0 g of Na2SO4 in the same mixture. The water permeance of TUF-324 was maintained in the range of 157.4 to 148.2 L/(m2 h bar), about 7 times higher than those (23.5-19.6 L/(m2 h bar)) of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed much higher CR/Na2SO4 retention selectivity of 15-16 than those of TUF-020. TUF-324 also showed higher anti-fouling capacity than TUF-020 with less CR rejection decay over time (Fig. 12).",n
"By comparing the filtration performance in this work with those reported in the literature, it is clear that ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with in-situ grown ZIF particles, TUF-326, 324, 624 and 924, had broken the Roberson trade-off outer bound between water permeance and retention selectivity (S) for CR/Na2SO4 [33-37], MO/Na2SO4 [38-42], MBe/Na2SO4 [38,39,43-45], bearing high potential to be used in recycling and purifying dyes for dye and textile industries (Fig. 13).",n
A new strategy has been developed to prepared ZIF/PSF TUF membranes with ultra-high water permeance and improved dye/salt retention selectivity involving in-situ grown ZIF particles during the NIPS process that embedded in and packed under the thinned PSF skin layers.,n
"More PVP loading in the casting solution increased capillary pore diameter (dc), Stokes solute rejection pore diameters (dr), surface roughness and hydrophilicity, resulting in increased water permeance and dye/salt retention selectivity, and decreased solute rejection rates. More 2MIM loading in the casting solution increased ZIF particle formation, improved surface hydrophilicity, reduced PSF skin thickness, capillary diameters and Stokes solute rejection diameters, leading to increased water flux, dye rejection rates and retention selectivity over salts. More Zn2+ formed more ZIF-8 particles, leading to higher surface roughness and reduced water contact angles, as well as increased water flux and decreased dye/salt retention selectivity. More reaction time led to decreased solute rejection diameter. Water flux was maximized at 45 min reaction time while the retention selectivity of dye/Na2SO4 was maximized at 30 min.",n
"With thinned PSF separating layer (200-500 nm) and embedding water permeating short-cuts from the ZIF particles, ZIF/PSF TUF membranes showed greatly increased water permeance, up to 250 L/(m2 h bar), and increased rejection rates (30-99%) for dyes and dye/salt retention selectivity, bearing high potential for applications in dye and textile waste water treatment processes.",n

"In the early 1980s, nanofiltration (NF) membranes were first introduced with several promising characteristics between ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) [1]. In recent decades, Nanofiltration (NF) has become the center of attention in separation and purification of aqueous and non-aqueous mixtures several applications including food, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and petrochemical industries, possessing the several advantages including flexible operation, low energy consumption, cost-efficiency and compactness of design [2-4]. It is noteworthy that the retention of dyes from water is considered as one of the largest applications in which nanofiltration membranes are utilized [5,6]. However, developing new membrane materials and exploring facile membrane fabrication methods, which are considered as the determining factors for the performance of the final membrane, are still required in this field [7,8].",n
"In the phase inversion method, the mixture of polymer and its solvent are brought to instability through several means, including: non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS), temperature-induced phase separation (TIPS) or vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS). So far, the NIPS process has been widely used to fabricate polymeric membranes, including reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, microfiltration and MD [9,10]. Nonetheless, the membranes fabricated by using this technique are comprised of an asymmetrical structure with macro-voids [11], which is regarded as a drawback in this field. Accordingly, the VIPS technique can be utilized as a promising alternative to address the issues shown by the NIPS one. In the VIPS method, before the immersion of the membrane into the coagulation bath, the spread polymer solution is exposed to a non-solvent vapor environment, which is generally humid air, for a certain time. It is worth pointing out that the mass transfer of water is slow from the vapor phase to casting solution when the membrane is exposed to the vapor environment, leading to the formation of a uniform spongy architecture in the membrane structure with no macro-voids [12-14]. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that, through controlling the fabrication conditions, including exposure time and relative humidity, the membrane morphology can be controlled [15]. For instance, Su et al. reported the fabrication of polysulfone membranes by the VIPS method, based on which it was demonstrated that the membrane morphology changed from the bi-continuous structure to the cellular one with longer exposure time [16].",n
"Through combining the above-mentioned methods, the formation of pin-holes on the dense layer, which deteriorates the selectivity of the membrane, can be successfully avoided [17]. Accordingly, coupled VIPS-NIPS methods have been also utilized as a promising approach for the fabrication of membranes [18]. In this approach, a preliminary stage, in which the nascent film is first exposed to fixed humid air, precedes the immersion in the coagulation bath. It is well-known that in these kinds of systems, the non-solvent is usually water, and therefore, by the water vapor transfer, the phase separation is promoted. The moist air takes an important part for the polymer precipitation, subsequently accomplished in the non-solvent bath.",n
"In recent years, Polysulfone (PSF) has been among the commonly utilized membrane materials, arising from its excellent properties including good mechanical, chemical and thermal stabilities along with excellent film-forming properties. Accordingly, Polysulfone is widely utilized for the fabrication of porous microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes [19,20]. Nonetheless, in spite of all the above-mentioned merits, Polysulfone membranes suffer from the tendency to be contaminated because of their hydrophobicity, which leads to declining of flux and lifespan of the fabricated membrane [21]. It has been demonstrated that the formation of mixed matrix membranes (MMM) can result in an enhancement in the permeance and selectivity of polymeric membranes [22].",n
"Mixed matrix membranes are fabricated through embedding inorganic fillers, such as zeolites, CNTs, SiO2, etc. in a polymer matrix, which provides a preferential flow path for the target species [2]. Nonetheless, if defects present at the filler/polymer interface are removed, they might overcome the tradeoff between membrane permeability and selectivity [23]. In recent years, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted numerous attention as a promising alternative to inorganic fillers utilized in MMMs [24]. MOFs are a class of hybrid inorganic-organic solid compounds which are made up of continuous bonding of transition metals and transition metal oxides with organic ligands, forming 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D porous structures [25]. MOFs can provide a variety of excellent properties including flexible structure, high surface area, controlled porosity, tunable chemical composition, functionalizable pore walls, excellent chemical, structural and thermal stability, and affinity for certain molecules [26]. It is worth pointing out that the organic linkage existing in the MOFs architecture is capable of providing a superior affinity for polymeric matrices when compared to the above-mentioned inorganic fillers, which is much easier to control MOF-polymer interactions. Hence, the formation of nonselective defects at the filler/polymer interface can be successfully prevented [27]. For instance, Basu et al. reported that, by incorporating modified MOFs into a matrix of polydimethylsiloxane membrane supported on polyimide, dye rejection can be considerably enhanced, while no considerable changes is observed in the permeance [28]. In another research work, Dai et al. fabricated defect-free polyphenylsulfone/ZIF-8 core-shell microsphere membranes, in which the MOF microspheres not only prevented the formation of nonselective defects but also enhanced the SRNF performance of polyphenylsulfone membranes [29].",n
"In this study, VIPS-NIPS method was utilized for the fabrication of a MIL-53(Al)-polysulfone mixed matrix membrane by using 1,4-Dioxane as the co-solvent. MIL-53(Al) was used in this research work as the MOF because of not only excellent water stability at room temperature but also small pore size [2]. Accordingly, different membrane compositions with various amounts of MIL-53(Al) were fabricated in order to achieve a membrane with superior performance for dye rejection application. Then, the rejection of different dyes, including Reactive Red (RR), Methyl Green (MG), Crystal Violet (CV), Direct Yellow (DY), Methylene Blue (MB), was investigated by the prepared membranes.",n
"Commercial polysulfone (PSf) with molecular weight of 35,000 g.mol-1 (Ultrason(r) 6010P) was supplied by BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 1,4-benzendicarboxylic acid, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), Al(NO3)3*9H2O (99.99%) and 1,4-dioxane were purchased from Merck Co. Ltd. (Darmstadt, Germany). The dyes including Reactive red, Direct yellow, Methyl green and crystal violet were all supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Co.",y
"The hydrothermally synthesis of MIL-53 (Al) was conducted according to the literature [30]. Accordingly, in the first step, Al(NO3)3*9H2O, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and DI water were mixed together with a molar ratio of 2:1:160. Subsequently, the as-prepared mixture was placed into a Teflon lined steel autoclave at the temperature of 220 degC for 72 h. After the accomplishment of the reaction, the steel autoclave was gradually cooled down to room temperature (RT). In the next step, a white product with the yield of 97%, based on the organic ligand, was achieved by centrifugation, followed via washing with DI water and drying in a vacuum oven at RT. Finally, the elimination of the excessive 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid which had been adsorbed in the pores was done by using heat treatment at 320 degC for 72 h in air.",y
"The PSf membranes were prepared by using vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) method coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) technique (VIPS-NIPS). It is well-known that the addition of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer solution along with applying an evaporation step before immersing the as-cast films into a coagulation bath have been reported for the successfully formation of integrally skinned asymmetric membranes [30]. Hence, a mixture of DMF, as the solvent, and 1,4-dioxane, as the volatile co-solvent, at a 3:1 wt ratio was utilized in this study for the fabrication of dope solutions. Accordingly, precise amounts of MIL-53(Al) were first added into the DMF/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed by sonication for 180 min in order to prepare homogeneous dispersions. In the next step, PSf with a concentration of 18 wt% was added into the as-prepared dispersions, and completely dissolved after continuously stirring at RT for 2 days. The MIL-53(Al) loading in the final dopes varied from 0 to 7 mg/g of MIL-53(Al) (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 mg/g). The homogenous polymer solution was de-aerated by using a vacuum process for 120 min and cast on a glass plate in a climatic box (relative humidity of 65 +- 5% and temperature 40 degC) by using a Doctor Blade device with a gap of 200 um. Only the MNIPS sample was formed by the NIPS process, and the other membranes were formed by the VIPS-NIPS method. By the coagulation step, the fabricated PSf membranes were separated from the glass plate. The fabricated membranes were stored in a soaking bath containing DI water for 1 day for the complete elimination of the residual solvent, followed by drying at RT. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4, according to the weight percentage of MIL-53(Al). The neat PSf membrane with 0 wt% of MIL-53(Al) was fabricated as the neat membrane and was labelled as M0. Furthermore, to draw a comparison, a membrane was also fabricated by the NIPS method, labelled as MNIPS. The compositions of the casting solutions are exhibited in Table 1.",y
"In this study, by using a self-made dead-end filtration apparatus, the water flux and dyes rejection of all the fabricated membranes were measured. A feed including a 30 ppm dye aqueous solution (Table 2) was added to the filtration apparatus and pushed to permeate through the fabricated membrane (effective surface area of 7 cm2) under the pressure of 5 bar. The experiments were conducted at 25 degC. Finally, data were measured via the following equations:(1)F=VAxt(2)R=CF-CPCFx100%In equation (1), F corresponds to the water flux (L/m2.h), A denotes the effective surface area of the prepared membranes (m2), V is ascribed to the permeate volume (L), and t is related to the interval of the test time (h). In equation (2), R denotes the rejection (%), and Cf and Cp are related to the feed and permeate solution concentrations which were determined via UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Pharo 300, Merck).",n
"The X-ray diffraction patterns of the fabricated membranes were collected by using a Philips PW1730 spectrometer with a Cu-Ka radiation source in the region of 2 from 5deg to 50deg. The EDS, SEM mapping (detector: Oxford Instrument), and surface and cross sectional morphology of the fabricated membranes were investigated by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), SIGMA VP, ZEISS, Germany. AFM analysis, NT-MDT, operating in a semi contact mode, was utilized in order to investigate the surface morphology of the fabricated membranes. Static water contact angle (WCA) test was also conducted by using Dataphysics, OCA 15 plus, to study the hydrophilic nature of the surface of the fabricated membranes. Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR, Avatar 370, Thermo), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCA 2000, MultiLab) analyses were also conducted to investigate the changes in chemical structure of the membranes after each step. The loading amount of MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles was investigated through evaluating the loading amount of Al elements via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Varian Vista-MPX. Accordingly, 1 cm2 of the prepared membranes was dissolved in 2 ml of aqua regia (1.5 ml HCl/0.5 ml HNO3) at 100 degC for 6 h, followed by diluting with DI water in order to reduce the acid concentration to <= 10% (v/v).",n
"The FTIR spectrum related to MIL-53 (Al) and all the prepared membranes are exhibited in Fig. 1. It is obvious in the spectrum of neat PSf that two strong absorptions have been emerged at 1489 and 1575 cm-1, related to the aromatic vibrational bonding of C = C in the PSf backbone. Additionally, the strong absorption peak present at about 1151 cm-1 is also attributed to the vibrational bonding of O = S = O in the PSf backbone. The absorption peak emerged at 1229 cm-1 also corresponds to the vibrational bonding of C-O-C in the ether group. Furthermore, the peak observed at 3049 cm-1 is also related to the vibrational bonding of = C-H in the aromatic ring of PSf backbone, and the two strong absorption bands appeared at about 1301 and 1318 cm-1 also shows the vibrational region of the sulfone group [31]. It can be discerned in the spectra of the membranes possessing MIL-53 (Al) that a new peak has appeared at 1665 cm-1 which is related to the vibration of carboxylic functional groups, indicating the presence of MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles in the prepared mixed matrix membranes [32].",n
"The elemental analysis was carried out on the surface of the MNIPS, M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 samples to evaluate the changes in the chemical composition of the fabricated membranes, as shown in Fig. 2. It is easily discernible that, after the addition of MIL-53 (Al) to the membranes matrix, the Al element has been detected by this analysis, demonstrating the successful introduction of MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles to the PSF matrix in the M1, M2, M3, M4 samples.",n
"The loading amount of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles was studied by evaluating the loading amount of Al elements via ICP-OES analysis. Based on the obtained results, the Al loading amounts were assessed at 0.04, 0.136, 0.232, and 0.329 mg/cm2 corresponding to M1, M2, M3, and M4 samples, respectively, demonstrating that high amounts of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles have been loaded in the membrane matrixes.",n
"X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted to evaluate the crystalline structure of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles and the prepared mixed matrix membranes (Fig. 3). It is discernible in this Figure that the corresponding peaks of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles, emerged at 2th = 8.4deg, 10.7deg, 15.5deg, 18.4deg, 21.1deg and 26.1deg [33], are almost unchanged in the fabricated mixed matrix membranes, demonstrating that the crystalline morphology and phase purity of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles are also maintained in the mixed matrix membranes.",n
"XPS analysis was also performed to demonstrate the incorporation of MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles into the M2 membrane matrix, as depicted in Fig. 4. The survey XPS spectrum of the M2 membrane not only shows the presence of Al elements, which are not observed in the survey XPS spectrum of the M0 membrane, but also exhibits the O 1 s peak with a higher intensity when compared to that of the M0 membrane. All these findings demonstrate the successful incorporation of MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles into the MMMs.",n
"The SEM images of the fabricated membranes surface are exhibited in Fig. 5. It is obvious that a dense skin layer has been formed on the top surface of the membranes. Moreover, the presence of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles is easily discernable on the surface of the M1, M2, M3, M4 samples with two different structures of sphere-like and rod-like. It can be confirmed that the more the amount of MIL-53(Al) nanoparticles has increased in the composition of the membranes, the more the structure the nanoparticles has shifted from sphere-like to rod-like.",n
"Cross-sectional SEM images of all the fabricated membranes are exhibited in Fig. 6. It is obvious in low-magnification images that an asymmetric morphology with finger-like structures has been formed in the architecture of the prepared membranes, arising from the use of high DMF concentration in the dope solution [31]. Furthermore, it is easily discernable in high-magnification images that an open cellular spongy morphology has been formed in the structure of the membranes prepared by the VIPS-NIPS method, i.e. M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 samples. It is well-known that, in the VIPS-NIPS approach, a slower absorption of water molecules takes place when compared to the NIPS one, which delays the phase inversion procedure, and consecutively, leads to the generation of a sponge-like morphology [34].",n
"By drawing a comparison between the untreated membrane (M0) and the other membranes prepared via the VIPS-NIPS method (M1, M2, M3, M4), it seems that the size of the cells firstly increases and then decreases for M3 and M4 samples, based on which it can be concluded that the phase separation is initially faster and then slows down [35]. Through the addition of MIL-53(Al), an enhancement in the solvent diffusion velocity from the polymer matrix takes place, arising from the decrease in the interactions between the polymer chains and solvent molecules through the hindrance effect of the introduced nanofillers [36]. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that the viscosity of the polymer casting solution increases by the increasing the MIL-53(Al) content, by which the diffusion of water molecules through the polymer matrix is slowed down. The reason for this observation is that the increased viscosity of the casting solution plays the role of a physical roadblock for the mass transfer between non-solvent and solvent, resulting in a delayed demixing throughout the membrane formation procedure [2].",n
"The surface roughness of the MNIPS, M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 samples was studied by using AFM analysis at a scan size of 5 mm x 5 mm, as depicted in Fig. 7 and listed in Table 3. It is obvious that Ra increases from 4.89 nm (M0 membrane) to 8.36 nm (M1 membrane), 11.41 nm (M2 membrane), 17.36 nm (M3 membrane) to 22.23 nm (M4 membrane). It was confirmed by AFM analysis that the roughness of the membranes surface have increased by introducing MIL-53(Al) to the membrane matrix. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the more the MIL-53(Al) content increased in the membrane matrix, the more the roughness increased. The ""valleys"" in the rough membrane surface lead to an improvement in the contact area, and therefore, enhances the water flux [37,38]. The data are in accordance with the water permeability of the fabricated membranes.",n
"Contact angle analysis was conducted to study the surface hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes, as exhibited in Fig. 8. It is well-known that the higher contact angle, the lower surface hydrophilic nature [39,40]. Accordingly, it is discernable that both of the untreated membranes, i.e. MNIPS and M0, have the highest contact angles among all the prepared membranes, demonstrating the hydrophobic nature of the surface of the untreated membranes. However, after the addition of MIL-53(Al), it can be seen that the contact angles of the treated membranes have decreased. The more MIL-53(Al) was added to the matrix of the treated membranes, the more contact angles decreased, confirming the improvement in the surface hydrophilicity of the treated membranes. Several membrane batches were prepared in order to evaluate repeatability, as represented in Table 4 (See Fig. 9.).",n
"The investigation of water Flux and dyes rejection performance of all the membranes was carried out in terms of the removal ability of MG, DY, CV and MB in an aqueous solution (Fig. 7). The membrane fabricated by the NIPS (MNIPS) method provided a much lower rejection ability when compared to the membrane prepared via the VIPS-NIPS (M0). Furthermore, it was found that the M2 membrane sample could provide the highest rejection ability among all the prepared membranes. It is also noteworthy that the M2 membrane sample provided the highest rejection ability for MG, with the highest molecular weight, and the lowest rejection ability for MB, with the lowest molecular weight. Additionally, water Flux of the M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4 membranes followed the order of M0 < M1 < M2 < M3 < M4, which can be attributed to the MIL-53 (Al) content in these membranes. The effect of MIL-53 (Al) on rejection and water Flux performance of the prepared membranes is schematically represented in Scheme 1. MIL-53 (Al) has proved to be a superb candidate filler for MMMs in aqueous solutions because of its permanent porosity, and great structural stability. The ordered porous structure and intensive hydrophilic surface of MOFs are essential for both the high dye rejection and the high-flux, because the homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles in a polymer matrix is able to provide additional small water passages along with an increase in the effective contact area of the prepared MMM to facilitate the channel of water molecules [27,41]. Moreover, the M0 membrane sample exhibited a slightly lower water Flux than that of the MNIPS sample, which can be attributed to its higher contact angle and denser top layer, which is in accordance with the literature [42]. Several membrane batches were fabricated to study repeatability, as listed in Table 4 (See Fig. 10.).",n
"It is evident in Fig. 11 that Almost an enhancement has been achieved in the permeate flux through the incorporation of nanoparticles in the M2 membrane. All these experimental results confirm that the antifouling performance of the prepared M2 mixed matrix membrane has been considerably improved as a result of the incorporation of MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles, resulting in exhibiting negligible changes in Flux through passing time. This enhancement can be originated from the effect of the incorporated MIL-53 (Al) nanoparticles in enhancing permeation pathways for water.",n
"Long-term durability of the prepared M2 membrane was carried out to investigate the flux and dye rejection ability of the membrane through running the experiments for ten days, as exhibited in Fig. 8. It was found that the M2 membrane had an outstanding performance in the rejection of the dyes utilized in this study for long periods. Even though flux has continuously declined because of dilution and fouling effect, the dye rejection showed negligible changes after ten days. This demonstrated that the M2 mixed matrix membrane performance, in terms of dye rejection, did not deteriorate by passing time.",n
"Comparison of nanofiltration membranes reported by other articles and the M2 sample prepared in this study is listed in Table 5, based on which it can be strongly confirmed that the membrane prepared in our work has a superior performance.",n
"In this study, a combination of two different methods, i.e. VIPS and NIPS techniques, were used for the preparation of polysulfone-MIL-53(Al) mixed matrix membranes. Because of possessing small pore sizes, hydrophilic nature and excellent water stability, we decided to introduce the MIL-53(Al) nanoparticle into the polysulfone membrane matrix and investigate its effects on the Flux performance and dyes rejection ability of the final mixed matrix membranes. Accordingly, various membrane compositions with different MIL-53(Al) weight percentages were prepared. It was found that the membrane with 0.06 wt% of MIL-53(Al) provided the highest rejection performance for all the dyes utilized in this study along with a suitable Flux, demonstrating its promising properties in this field.",n

"Thin-film composite (TFC) membranes have been extensively applied in nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) owing to their excellent selectivity, high permeability and energy efficiency [1]. A TFC membrane has a thin selective layer on the support membrane which is composed of non-woven fabrics (NWFs) substrate layer and porous support layer. Generally, the performance of the TFC membrane could be influenced by regulating the membrane structure, the physicochemical properties and the special function of different layers. Numerous studies are focused on the selective layer owing to its decisive effect on the performance of TFC membranes [2,3]. However, the porous support layer and the NWFs can regulate the transport pathway of water and solutes through the membrane [4-6], which also affects the performance of TFC membrane [7,8]. With good mechanical strength, acid and alkali resistance and chemical stability [9], polysulfone (PSf) membranes which are fabricated by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method have been preferred chosen as support layer in many commercial TFC membranes [10-12]. The pore structure and morphologies of PSf membranes formed via NIPS are classified as finger-like pores and sponge-like pores, which are mainly influenced by liquid-liquid and solid-liquid phase separation or polymer precipitation rates [13-15]. In general, the delayed phase separation produces membranes with ""sponge-like"" structure, while transient phase separation produces membranes with large ""finger-like"" substructure [16-18]. Additionally, several studies have shown that an ideal support layer with thin sponge-like structure was much more beneficial in designing high-performance TFC membranes due to its withstand high pressures [19]. As known, the support membrane with finger-like structure, similar to other porous ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, had poor pressure resistance and can only suffer low pressure (~0.2 MPa) [20], which greatly limited its application in pressure separation, especially in NF or RO application. However, the support membrane with sponge-like structure exhibited better compressive performance and breaking strength than that of the membrane with finger-like pore structure, which was beneficial to be used as the support layer of NF or RO membranes [21,22]. Therefore, it was necessary to prepare sponge-like structure PSf membranes.",n
"Currently, the research of the formation and morphology of support layer mainly focuses on the composition of casting solution [23-25], the composition and conditions of coagulation bath and the non-solvent additives [26], etc. Ismail [24] and Wang [25] et al. systematically investigated the influence of PSf concentration on the membrane structure. It was reported that higher PSf concentrations increased the viscosity of the system, resulting in longer phase separation times and gelation times. The thickness of the prepared PSf membrane increased, the skin structure was dense, and the membrane permeability was correspondingly reduced. Ali [27] et al. added ethanol to the coagulation bath to slow down the entry of non-solvents into the casting solution while preparing the PES support layer for NF membrane. Both the polymer precipitation and retarded phase separation were slowed down, which eventually resulted in the formation of sponge-like pores. Blanco [28] et al. studied the effects of coagulation bath temperature on the morphology of the PSF + SPSF co-blends supporting layer in NF membranes. It was found that the size and numbers of the finger-like pore structure increased as the coagulation bath temperature declined as the result of a lower diffusion of non-solvent in and solvent out. As a non-solvent additive, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) played an important role in the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the PSf casting solution, especially for its generated membrane structure. Han [26] et al. found that the viscosity of the casting solution raised significantly as the PVP content increased (PVP mass fraction >20%), leading to a lower rate of solvent/non-solvent exchange, which delayed the phase separation of the casting solution and inhibited the macro-porous structure of the membrane. Although extensive studies have focused on preparing PSf membranes with various structures, the influence of different fabrication parameters for PSf support layer with sponge-like structure is not systematically studied.",n
"Additionally, the structure and performance of porous support membranes are also influenced by different materials and properties of the NWFs substrate layer. Sairam [29] et al. used nylon woven fabric to prepare FO membrane. The results indicated that the coating solution penetrated into the fabric to form a defected low permeability cellulose acetate (CA) membrane. Conversely, a dense nonwoven could lead to a lower adhesion between the polymer and the fabric layer resulting in membrane delamination and defects. Goettmann [30] et al. found that using dense fabric in the film-forming process would lead to the delamination of the polymer layer. Additionally, Vilakati [31] et al. used two different materials NWFs of polyester and polyphenylenesulphide as supports to prepare TFC membranes, and they found that pure water fluxes (PWF) and NaCl rejections of the TFC membranes were affected by different NWFs materials. Tang [32] et al. systematically investigated the influence of fabrics properties on the morphologies and separation performance of the PSf membrane. The results indicated that PSf casting solution was easily infiltrated into the NWFs pores with low fiber density, which reduced the thickness of the PSf layer, widened the finger-like pore structure, and increased the permeation flux. Recently, Wang [33] et al. used two kinds of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) NWFs with different thicknesses to study their effects on the performance of the PVDF-gPEGMA UF membranes. They found that the PVDF membranes using thin PET fabrics had higher PWF than that with thick PET fabrics, which was attributed to the thinner and higher porosity of the PET fabric. To summarize, the polymer, the phase transformation conditions, the fabric characteristics and the interaction between these properties must be considered in the membrane-forming process. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies were focused on fabricating PSf membrane with sponge-like structure via changing PET substrates with different properties. Herein, the fabrication parameters, the fabric support properties and their influencing mechanism must be taken into account in the preparation of PSf membrane with sponge-like structure.",n
"In this work, PSf porous support membranes were prepared via NIPS method, and three different PET NWFs were selected as the substrate layer. The morphologies of the support membranes were adjusted by changing the coagulation bath temperature, pre-evaporation time, relative humidity and scraping membrane thickness. Then, the effects of the PET NWFs properties on the sponge pore support membranes were investigated. Finally, the optimal fabricating parameters and the PET NWFs fabric were confirmed with the PWF, BSA rejection and anti-fouling of the PSf membrane. This work may provide a reference for optimizing the support membrane structure and selecting the PET NWFs substrate layers to fabricate TFC membranes.",n
"Three kinds of PET NWFs named as NWF-01, NWF-02 and NWF-03 (PET, Hirose Co., Japan) were purchased for support fabrication. Commercial HT PSf ultrafiltration membrane named as PSf-HT were pruchased from VONTR (PSf, Beijing VONTRON Co., LTD, China).",y
"Polysulfone (PSf, P-3500 LCD MB7, Mw = 77,000-83,000 g/mol, Solvay, Belgium) was chosen to fabricate the membrane. N, N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc, Mw = 87.12 g/mol, Peking Reagent, China) was used as the solvent and polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw = 400 g/mol, MERYER, China) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 8000 g/mol, Innochem, China) were used as the additive in the casting solution. Deionized (DI) water was obtained using a Merck Mili-Q purification system among the whole experiment. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mw = 67,000 g/mol, Macklin, China) dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0-7.2) was used to evaluate membrane rejection. The concentration of BSA in the solution was 1000 ppm. All reagents were utilized directly without further treatment.",y
"The casting solution was composed of 19 wt% PSf, 7 wt% PEG, 0.5 wt% PVP and 73.5 wt% DMAc which were filled into a 500 mL flask. Then, the flask was heated to 95 degC by an oil bath. The homogenous casting solution was obtained after continuous stirring for 7 h at 2600 rpm (DF-101S Collective thermostatic heating magnetic stirrer, Shanghai Zhenjie Experimental Equipment Co., China). Lastly, the resulting casting solution was put into a vacuum oven at 25 degC for at least 24 h.",y
"PSf support membranes were prepared via NIPS method. NWFs were attached to the steel plate and then the dope solution was casted uniformly by an automatic film applicator (Elcometer 4340 Automatic Film Applicator, Elcometer Co., England) with a steel knife. The relative humidity was determined by adjusting the intensity of automatic humidifier (SC-3K40 air humidifier, Midea Group, China) and using indoor humidity measuring instrument (LondiSun LS-207 electronic moisture meter, Shanghai Diyi Zhan Trading Co., China). The nascent membranes were exposed to atmosphere for several seconds and then soaked into the coagulating bath with different temperature for 30 min to proceed the phase inversion. The prepared membranes were kept in DI water before test. The PSf membranes formed on three different PET NWFs (NWF-01, NWF-02 and NWF-03) were denoted as PSf-NWF-01, PSf-NWF-02, and PSf-NWF-03 membranes, respectively.",y
"The PWF and BSA rejection (R) of the PSf membranes were assessed by the dead-end filtering device (HP4750 Stirred Cell, pcsr-tech). The PSf membranes were pre-pressurized with DI water at 0.2 MPa for 0.5 h before being tested. The rejection of PSf membrane was measured by 1000 ppm BSA feed solution at 0.10 MPa under room temperature. The PWF (J, L/(m2*h)) and BSA rejection (R, %) of the PSf membranes were calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2)[34]:(1)J=VAxDt(2)R=(1-cpcf)x100%where V (L) is the volume of permeated water over a certain period of time Dt (h)at different pressure, A (m2) is the effective membrane area (14.6 cm2). CF and CP are the BSA concentrations in the feed and permeate, respectively, which were measured by UV-visible spectrophotometer (TU-1810, Beijing Puxi, China) at the wavelength of 280 nm [35].",n
"To access the anti-fouling performance of the PSF membranes, 1000 ppm BSA solution was used as the evaluation system for filtration tests. The BSA flux was recorded every 15 min during continuous filtration at 0.2 MPa for 2 h. Normalized flux (J/J0) was used to represent the extent of membrane fouling, where J and J0 were the BSA flux at a certain time and initial BSA flux, respectively. Theoretically, a high value of normalized flux indicated a low level of membrane fouling.",n
"The membranes were soaked in dilute NaOH solution (0.4 g/L) for 12 h after BSA filtration for 2 h. The PWF (Jw) of the cleaned membrane was measured again and the flux recovery rate (FRR) of the membranes was measured using Eq. (3):(3)FRR=Jw1Jwwhere Jw1 and Jw represent PWF of the membrane before and after BSA solution filtration, respectively. In general, membrane fouling includes reversible fouling (Rr) and irreversible fouling (Rir). Rr was caused by concentration polarization and the formation of a gel layer on the membrane surface, while Rir was caused by adsorption on the membrane pore surface [36]. Rr and Rir can be calculated as follows:(4)Rr=Jw1-JpJwx100%(5)Rir=Jw-Jw1Jwx100%where Jp is the BSA solution flux of the membrane, expressed in L/(m2*h).",n
"The chemical compositions of the PSf membranes were determined by a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) which was configured with a Nicolet 6700 Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation, USA).",n
"The morphologies of the PET NWFs and PSf membranes were obtained by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7401, Tokyo, Japan) under an accelerating voltage of 3 kV. Samples were kept in the drying oven at 60 degC at least 2 h before sputter-coated with platinum. Samples were pretreated and fractured in liquid nitrogen before observing its cross-sectional morphologies.",n
"The water contact angles (WCAs) of PET NWFs and PSf membranes were measured by an optical contact angle goniometer (OCA20, Data physics Co., Ltd., Germany) which was set to the sessile drop method. Both static and dynamic WCAs for the samples were measured at least 5 times [31].",n
"In order to reduce the influence of physical forces and chemical agents on the structure of PSf membrane, the characterization of PET NWFs and PSf membrane were measured together as a whole. Firstly, the samples were immersed in DI water for 48 h and weighed after brushing off water on the surface. Then the wet samples were dried in an oven at 60 degC for 24 h and weighed again. The weight and effective area of samples should be recorded. The porosity (e) of PET NWFs and PSf membranes was determined by Eq.(6)[37,38]:(6)e=Ww-WdrAsx100%",n
"The tortuosity (t) of the fabric was calculated by Archie's law basing on the e measurements and evaluated by Eq. (7) as follows [39],(7)t=1e0.3where Ww and Wd(g) are the weights of the wet and dry samples, respectively. r, A(cm2) and d(mm) are the water density (1.0 x 103 kg/m3), effective area and the thickness of the wet samples, respectively. Additionally, the surface mean pore size and porosity (es) of PSf membranes were analyzed by ImageJ software through SEM images [35,40].",n
"The physical property parameters of PET NWFs were measured and calculated to study the effect on the performance of PSf membranes. The structure parameter (S) is the average distance of molecules passing through the support layer from the bulk solution, or the barrier diffusion path caused by the membrane structure, which is defined as [41],(8)S=KD=tstewhere K, D, ts, t and e are the resistance to solute diffusion, the solute diffusivity, the thickness of the support, the tortuosity and the bulk porosity of the PET NWFs and PSf membrane, respectively [19].",n
"Furthermore, the pore size of the PET NWFs is calculated by the Hagen-Poiseuille model using the air permeability. And the permeability(Lp) can be determined by.(9)Lp=erp28mttswhere rp and m are the pore radius and the viscosity of air at 20 degC, respectively.",n
"Exploring the interaction forces between the polymer, coagulant and PET NWFs provides a better understanding of how the PET NWFs affect the formation of the membrane. The uptake of the polymer solution by the fabric can be judged by capillary pressure. The Young-Laplace equation is taken to calculate the capillary pressure (pc) in the pores of the fabric [42],(10)pc=2gLcosthcrp",n
"Positive capillary pressure states that the PET NWFs pull the polymer solution into the pores spaces interstitial spaces, leading to a high adhesion between PET NWFs and the PSf layer. Conversely, the negative capillary pressure reveals that the polymer solution is excluded from the interstitial spaces to the PET NWFs surface causing a low adhesion between the two layers. Additionally, the solid-liquid interfacial energy (-DGSL) is determined by [31].(11)-DGSL=gL[1+costhc]where gL is the liquid surface tension for pure water (72.8 mJ/m2) at 20 degC [43,44]. The larger value of -DGSL, the higher interaction energy between the surface and the liquid [31].",n
"Initially, NWF-02 fabric was chosen to prepare the PSf support membrane. The effects of membrane fabrication parameters (such as coagulation bath temperature, relative humidity, pre-evaporation time, and membrane thickness) on the membrane structure were discussed. Relatively uniform membrane preparation conditions would be obtained eventually for preparing PSf support membrane with sponge-like pores.",n
"The effects of different coagulation bath temperatures (set at 25 degC, 40 degC, 50 degC and 60 degC) on the surface and cross-sectional structure of PSf membrane prepared by NIPS were investigated in this section. The membrane fabrication parameters of relative humidity, pre-evaporation time and membrane thickness were fixed as 20%, 30 s and 60 mm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the pore size of the membrane surface and the thickness of the skin layer increased as the coagulation bath temperatures raised. Interestingly, the cross-section morphologies of the membrane transformed gradually from finger-like macro-voids to short and narrow finger-like structure with dense sponge-like top layer, and finally formed uniform sponge-like structure at 60 degC. The solvents and additives continuously diffuse into the coagulation bath, while the non-solvent enters from the coagulation bath into the as-cast membrane in NIPS process [17,24]. The diffusion rates of solvents and non-solvent between the polymer solution and non-solvent interface determine the final membrane structure [45]. With the raising of the coagulation bath temperature, the diffusion rate of the two and the phase inversion rate were accelerated. Hence, a large amount of non-solvent entered the as-cast membrane, and the membrane was in a high swelling state, contributing to a looser and larger pore for the membrane surface as the coagulation bath temperature raised. Basically, the above diffusion rates are affected by the heat transfer rate and the mass transfer rate of the casting solution in the coagulation bath at different temperatures. When the coagulation bath temperature was lower than the casting solution's cloud point, the mass transfer rate played a dominant role in forming finger-like structure in PSf membrane. As the coagulation bath temperature raised to the cloud point, the cloud point curve would approach the polymer-nonsolvent axis. At the moment, heat transfer became the main driving force for the formation of the membrane, and the sponge-like structure was formed [21,46]. Therefore, the cross-section morphologies of the PSf membrane transformed gradually from finger-like macro-voids to short and narrow finger-like structure, and finally to uniform sponge-like structure as the coagulation bath temperature increased. Moreover, the solubility of hydrophilic PEG in the casting solution increased as the coagulation bath temperature raised, resulting in a lower precipitation rate of polymer and ultimately changing the shape of the macrovoids from finger-like to sponge-like pores [47]. In a word, the instantaneous phase separation was gradually replaced by the delayed phase separation as the coagulation bath temperature increased, which led to more sponge-like pores [48]. Therefore, the coagulating bath temperature of 60 degC was taken as the optimal condition to obtain PSf membrane with sponge-like structure.",n
"Adjusting the humidity of air can also be used to control the morphology of the membrane. The other preparation conditions were kept constant (coagulation bath temperatures: 60 degC; pre-evaporation time: 30 s; casting thickness: 60 mm). The effects of relative humidity of air on the morphology of PSf membrane were presented in Fig. 2. As the relative humidity of air increased from 20% to 30%, 40%, 50%, the pore density and the pore size of membrane surface increased [49]. Meanwhile, the cross-sectional structure of PSf membrane drastically changed from homogeneous sponge-like to a macrovoid, loose sponge-like. Specifically, the dense skin layer of the top surface almost disappeared and the cross-sectional structure of the membrane became a symmetrical loose sponge-like structure as the relative humidity increased from 20% to 40%. When the relative humidity increased to 50%, much more macrovoid sponge-like pores were formed in the cross-sectional structure of PSf membrane. By exposing the nascent membrane to humidity, the polymer precipitation rate slowed down, promoting a delayed exchange between the solvent and the non-solvent, giving rise to sponge-like pores structure. Furthermore, the mass transfer rate of solvent outward in the casting solution was greater than that of non-solvent inward in NIPS process, which was conducive to form dense surface. Conversely, if the mass transfer rate of non-solvent inward was greater than that of solvent outward, porous membranes tend to be formed [16,50]. Therefore, at the initial phase inversion state, the composition of the nascent membrane was most affected by the water vapor, and the mass transfer rate of moisture in the air diffusing into the membrane increased as the relative humidity increased, resulting in more porous structure on the surface and more loose sponge-like macrovoid structure throughout the support layer [51]. We aimed to obtain a PSf membrane with small pore size, a relative humidity condition of 20% was selected.",n
"The pre-evaporation time referred to the time when the casting solution was exposed to the air before immersion in the coagulating bath. The pre-evaporation time was set as four gradients (20 s, 30 s, 40 s and 60 s respectively) to explore its influence on the PSf membrane structure while other conditions were maintained constant (coagulation bath temperature: 60 degC, relative humidity: 20% and theoretical thickness: 60 mm). As shown in Fig. 3, the pore on the membrane surface was smaller in size and less in number with the extension of evaporation time. Meanwhile, the macrovoids in the cross sectional structure were gradually replaced by uniform sponge pores, and the thickness of skin layer was gradually increased. Finally, a compact and dense skin layer was formed when the pre-evaporation time was more than 40 s. When the evaporation time was extended to the 60 s, the pore on the membrane surface was gradually reduced and the thickness of the skin layer increased further. The polymer concentration on the surface of as-cast membrane could be increased as the pre-evaporation time prolongs, and further affecting the membrane structure [52-54]. The above results also verified that the pre-evaporation time had an essential influence on the compactness of the membrane surface. The formation of the dense skin layer on the PSf membrane was caused by the increase of PSf polymer concentration on the as-cast membrane surface as the evaporation of the volatile solvent [24]. The increased PSf polymer concentration led to an increase in the degree of entanglement or interaction between the polymer molecular chains on the surface [55], which increased the resistance of the non-solvent to enter the as-cast membrane and then delayed phase separation occurred, and eventually sponge-like structure formed [56,57]. To sum up, we chose the pre-evaporation time of 30 s as the optimal condition for follow-up investigation to obtain PSf membrane with uniform sponge-like and thin skin layer.",n
"The effects of membrane thickness on PSf membrane structure were studied in this section (coagulation bath temperature: 60 degC, relative humidity: 20% and pre-evaporation time: 30 s). A proper casting knife was used leading to membranes of thickness ranging from 30 to 160 mm (a:30 mm; b: 60 mm; c: 100 mm; d: 160 mm). As seen in Fig. 4, the thickness of the PSf membranes were 30 mm, 64 mm, 98 mm, and 161 mm, respectively. The pore size of the membrane surface became smaller and the cross-sectional structure transformed from sponge-like pores to finger-like pores as the membrane thickness increased. The surface porosity decreased with the increase of membrane thickness. The main reason was that the thickening of the membrane increased the mass transfer resistance, leading to the reduction of the solvent and non-solvent exchange rate. Therefore, the pore size and porosity of the membrane surface decreased [58]. When the membrane thickness increased from 30 mm to 160 mm, many more, longer and narrower finger-like pores formed, and also the thinner top skin layer and thicker bottom dense layer gradually appeared. The possible reason was that much space was provided for the growth of internal pore sizes as the membrane thickness increased [59]. Therefore, the finger-like pores growing-up step was then hindered as the space between the top surface and bottom in thin as-cast membrane narrowed (i.e. membrane thickness decreased), and then sponge-like pore structure formed. In addition, the PET NWFs were used as the support layer, it prevented the non-solvent entering the casting solution from bottom to top [32], and the bottom phase inversion slowed down to form a sponge-like pore structure [17,60]. Briefly, the scraping thickness was controlled at about 60 mm to obtain the PSf membrane with sponge-like structure with small pore size.",n
"As stated above, the PSf membranes with much more, smaller surface pore and higher porosity could be prepared while the membrane fabrication parameters of coagulating bath temperature, relative humidity, evaporation time and the membrane thickness were 60 degC, 20%, 30 s and 60 um, respectively. Therefore, the above optimal fabrication parameters were expected to be selected for studying the influence of PET NWFs on PSf membrane, which will be discussed in the next section.",n
"The surface chemical structures of all the NWFs were determined by ATR-FTIR spectra, as presented in Fig. 5. Some peaks corresponding to CO bond stretching vibration, CO bond stretching vibration, OCO asymmetric stretching and CH2 bending vibration were emerged at 1712 cm-1, 1240 cm-1, 1092 cm-1 and 721 cm-1, respectively. Based on the above results, the three NWFs were proved to polyethylene terephthalate (PET).",n
"Besides the chemical composition, the morphologies and surface properties of all the PET NWFs (named NWF-01, NWF-02, and NWF-03) were also characterized, as shown in Fig. 6 and listed in Table 1. All of the NWF-01, NWF-02, and NWF-03 had uniform fiber thickness (Fig. 6). The thickness and the fiber thickness of PET NWFs followed this order: NWF-03 > NWF-02 > NWF-01, and the NWF-01 had fine and tightly packed fibers might with a lower gas permeability. This speculation was verified by gas penetration test, and some physical parameters of the PET NWFs were also presented in Table 1. The bulk porosity and the structural parameters were NWF-03 > NWF-02 > NWF-01 in descending order. Meanwhile, the air permeability of NWF-01, NWF-02 and NWF-03 were 489.19, 508.35 and 522.20 mm/Pas, respectively. It indicated that the airtightness of the NWF-01 was better than that of others, reflecting its higher degree of denseness. As known, gas permeability can be affected by multiple physical parameters of PET NWFs, which could be positively related to fiber diameter and bulk porosity and negatively to the thickness and structural parameters [61]. Although the thickness of NWF-03 was the thickest, its volume porosity was the largest, which led to lower resistance for gas transport path through it, ultimately resulting in a higher gas permeability compared to the other PET NWFs [62,63]. Additionally, the WCA values of the three PET NWFs were presented in Fig. 7, and the specific data were NWF-03 (90.55deg) > NWF-02 (87.09deg) > NWF-01 (82.19deg). Actually, all the three NWFs were polyethylene terephthalate (Fig. 5). Therefore, the roughness variation of the NWF substrate was the main reason for the difference in the WCA [64]. Fig. 8 showed the rough characterization of the three PET NWFs. Generally speaking, the greater the roughness, the better the hydrophilicity when the WCA was lower than 90deg. It can be seen that the roughness of NWF-01 (396 nm), NWF-02 (331 nm) and NWF-03 (314 nm) decreased successively. Therefore, the hydrophilicity of NWF-01 was better than that of other PET NWFs. In addition, the increase of roughness also affected the bonding force between the casting solution and the PET NWFs. The PET NWFs with larger roughness had greater adhesion to the casting solution [32]. Thus, the structure of PSf membrane would be affected by the PET NWFs with different hydrophilic and roughness, which would be discussed in the next section.",n
"To further investigate the influence of the substrate hydrophilicity and roughness on the morphology and performance of the resulting PSf membranes, the above three kinds of PET NWFs were used as substrates to prepare sponge-like structured PSf membranes under the same optimal preparation conditions which were established in Section 4.1. The composition, preparation method and process of casting solution were the same as those described in Section 2.2. Subsequently, the properties, the PWF and BSA rejection for the three kinds of PSf membranes (named PSf-NWF-01, PSf-NWF-02 and PSf-NWF-03 membrane) were tested and discussed in detail. Herein, Fig. 9 showed the ATR-FTIR spectra of the different PSf membranes. Compared to the PET NWFs (Fig. 5), it could be seen that the stretching vibration peaks of SO2 group at 1584 cm-1, 1149 cm-1, and 1296 cm-1, the bending vibration peak of CH3 at 1487 cm-1 and 1240 cm-1 were appeared, which illustrated that the PSf membrane was successfully formed on the PET NWFs [65].The surface and cross-sectional micrographs of the prepared PSf membranes were presented in Fig. 10. It showed that all the PSf layers via a typically delayed phase separation produced membranes with ""sponge-like"" structure. The thickness of PSf-NWF-01, PSf-NWF-02 and PSf-NWF-03 membranes were 41.38, 42.78 and 64.03 mm, respectively. Although the top surfaces of all the membranes appeared to be smooth and porous, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane had the lowest surface average pore size (30.40 nm) and the highest pore density (9.77 x 10-3) (Table 2). To be specifically, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane showed a higher surface pore density and volume porosity than all the other PSf membranes, which was consistent with the higher hydrophilicity of NWF-01. During phase inversion, the PET NWFs offered a barrier for water intrusion to nascent PSf membrane from the bottom and then delay the solidification process, which was accelerated by the hydrophilicity of the PET NWFs. In contrast to the other PET NWFs, NWF-01 with higher hydrophilicity intensified the rate of the solvent/water exchange in the coagulation bath, resulting in a higher porosity of the resulting PSf membranes [57].",n
"Finally, the PWF and BSA rejection performance of the three self-made PSf membranes and a commercial membrane (PSf-HT, properties in Table 2) were illustrated in Fig. 11. Specifically, the order of PWF was PSf-NWF-01 (463.69 L/(m2*h)) > PSf-NWF-02 (285.27 L/(m2*h)) > PSf-HT (243.13 L/(m2*h)) > PSf-NWF-03 (147.26 L/(m2*h)). The PWF of PSf-NWF-01 membrane was much higher than that of other PSf membranes. It was explained by that the PSf-NWF-01 membrane had a thinner thickness, a smaller tortuosity, a higher surface pore density and volume porosity (Table 2), which had a positive impact on the permeation flux. Additionally, the BSA rejections for PSf-HT (98.1%) and PSf-NWF-01 (97.58 %) membranes were much higher than those of other PSf membranes (<95%), the main reason was that the pore size and its distribution (Table 2) for PSf-HT and PSf-NWF-01 membranes were smaller and uniform. To summarize, the self-made PSf-NWF-01 membrane had the optimum performance among the above membranes.",n
"Actually, the PET NWFs offered a barrier for water intrusion to the nascent PSf membrane which can delay the solidification in NIPS process, but it can be accelerated by the hydrophilicity of the PET NWFs, and then a thinner and porous PSf membrane could be formed. The increase in the porosity of membrane structure would open the diffusion path, thereby improving the permeability [31]. Many researchers proposed that PSf membrane with better structure and pore properties can be formed on PET NWFs with higher hydrophilicity, maximum roughness and compact fiber accumulation [31,32,66], which were also proved in our study. Based on the above results, PET NWFs with different roughness were considered to play an essential role in the formation of membrane morphology. As presented in Fig. 12, the capillary pressure of the three PET NWFs had a good correlation with the solid-liquid interface energy, while the water flux of the membrane was also closely related to capillary pressure and solid-liquid interfacial energy [67]. According to the Young-Laplace equation, NWF-01 with higher roughness and hydrophilicity had the highest capillary force owing to their higher solid-liquid interfacial energy and stronger binding force, which meant the polymer casting solution could be better absorbed by NWF-01 to form a thinner PSf layer. Thus, the gap between the PSf layer and the NWF-01 layer was narrowed and the transmission path of water was shortened with a lower transmission resistance, which contributed to a higher water flux. On the contrary, there was a larger repulsion between NWF-03 and PSf casting solution due to its higher hydrophobic, lower roughness and minimum negative capillary force. Therefore, the lowest adhesion between NWF-03 and PSf membrane resulted in poor performance of PSf-NWF-03 membrane. Above all, the increase in membrane thickness would effectively increase the length of the water diffusion path, thereby reducing the water flux [65]. It was concluded that sponge-like structure PSf support membrane with better pore properties was easier to form on hydrophilic PET NWFs with higher roughness.",n
"To evaluate the anti-fouling ability of the PSf membranes, the BSA protein solution filtration tests were carried out, and the results were shown in Fig. 13. The decreasing amplitude of membrane flux in descending order was PSf-NWF-01, PSF-HT, PSf-NWF-02 and PSf-NWF-03. In the process of BSA filtration, the flux attenuation of the four membranes generally went through three stages: rapidly decaying in the initial stage (about 0-60 min), then slowing down in the middle stage (about 60-120 min) and keeping stable in the late stage (about 120-210 min). Such flux decay trends were also found in other studies [68]. The reason was that the adsorption of some protein molecules on the membrane surface at the early filtration stage, resulted in a rapid decrease in flux. Then, the fouling rate gradually decreased until the flux was stable in the middle and late stages, which was due to the formation of filter cake layer [68]. Additionally, the flux recovery rate (FRR) and fouling resistances (Ri or Rir) were important parameters to evaluate the antifouling performance of the membranes. As shown in Fig. 14, the FRR of the membranes were PSf-NWF-01 (88.59%), PSf-HT (88.29%), PSf-NWF-02 (87.29%) and PSf-NWF-03 (85.41%). Meanwhile, the values of Rir followed by PSf-NWF-01(11.41%) < PSf-HT (11.71%) < PSf-NWF-02 (12.71%) < PSf-NWF-03 (14.59%). Combining the previous membrane properties, it concluded that PSf-NWF-01 membrane with a higher hydrophilicity (Fig. 15), smaller surface pores and a smooth surface morphology (Fig. 10) leading to higher FRR and lower Rir, and also illustrated its higher anti-fouling performance. Correspondingly, the PSf-NWF-03 membrane was fouled easily, mainly because BSA protein molecules were easier to enter the membrane surface with large pore size. The increase of protein adsorption in membrane surface can aggravate the blockage degree of membrane pores and eventually lead to the deterioration of membrane fouling [69-71]. Overall, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane prepared on the higher hydrophilic PET NWFs not only had uniform sponge pore structure, but also had high PWF, rejection and anti-fouling ability.",n
"In this work, a series of PSf support membranes with sponge-like structure were fabricated by NIPS using three different PET NWFs as the substrate layers. The influences of membrane fabrication parameters and PET NWFs' properties on sponge-like structure PSf membrane with high performance were systematically studied. Sponge-like structure PSf support membranes can be obtained by adjusting the fabrication parameters while the coagulation bath temperature, relative humidity, pre-evaporation time and scraping membrane thickness were 60 degC, 20%, 30 s, 60 mm, respectively. Moreover, the fiber diameter, thickness, volume porosity, structural parameters, hydrophobicity and capillary pressure of all the NWF-01, NWF-02, and NWF-03 were characterized. The results showed that the hydrophilicity of PET NWFs was positively correlated with the performance of PSf membranes according to Young-Laplace equation, which indicated the adhesion degree between PSf and NWFs. Accordingly, NWF-01 had a stronger adhesion to PSf casting solution resulting from its higher hydrophilic, and then a thinner and porous PSf layer was formed. Hence, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane showed an ideal performance compared with other self-made PSf or HT commercial membrane, with PWF and BSA rejection were 463.69 L/(m2*h) and 97.58%, respectively. Moreover, the PSf-NWF-01 membrane also exhibited the highest flux recovery ratio of 88.59% and the lowest irreversible fouling of 11.41%. This work was expected to provide a reference for optimizing the preparation conditions of the sponge-like structure PSf membrane and selecting appropriate PET NWFs for manufacturing TFC membranes.",n

"As one of the emerging agriculture-based industries, natural rubber mills unavoidably produce a large amount of wastewater. The excessive generation of wastewater from local rubber industries results in severe air and water pollution, contributing to environmental damage. To address this issue, there is a window of opportunity to develop an effective rubber-laden wastewater (NRW) treatment. Commonly, NRW is treated using coagulation-flocculation [1] or biological treatment [2] prior to its disposal in the water body. Unfortunately, these methods generate sludge as a by-product that requires further treatment before discharging to the landfill. This post-treatment requires additional expenses, which contributes to an increase in operational costs for wastewater treatment.",n
"In recent years, membrane technology has been widely implemented for water and wastewater treatments due to its technical applicability and outstanding removal performances as compared to other processes. The advantages of membrane technology include continuous separation, efficient and clean energy consumption, versatility to be integrated with other physicochemical separations, adjustable physical and separation properties, less chemical consumption, applicability for separating thermally-sensitive solutions (biological and organic solutions), and less sludge generation [3-5]. Particularly, membrane reactor technology has been extensively applied for many wastewater treatments [6,7]. A membrane reactor is an integrated technology that combines filtration and reaction processes in a single unit simultaneously. However, this method still struggles with limitations, including low pollutant rejection, fouling formation, lack of reusability, and poor durability [8,9]. New membranes with superior characteristics that can tackle those problems are urgently needed for membrane reactor technology. As a type of membrane reactor technology, the photocatalytic membrane became a popular method for treating wastewater that contains complicated contaminants [10-12]. The semiconductor materials as the photocatalysts are incorporated into the polymer matrix to synthesize the photocatalytic membrane composite [10,13].",n
"Semiconductor oxides have been widely utilized as photocatalysts, such as tin oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), magnetite (Fe3O4), silver phosphate (Ag3PO4), tungsten oxide (WO3), titanium oxide (TiO2), cerium oxide (CeO2), bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6), and graphene oxide (GO) [14-22]. They have been applied for degrading pollutants, including dyes, organic pollutants, natural organic matters, and pharmaceutical substances [12,23,24]. Among them, TiO2 has attracted extensive attention from scientists and engineers because of its chemical stability, ease to activate, low toxicity, modifiable, and water-insoluble, showing promising application for wastewater treatment [10]. ZnO has a similarity with TiO2 regarding the photocatalytic characteristics such as similar bandgap (3.10 - 3.37 eV), UV light-driven activation, large availability, chemically, and thermally stable [25,26]. Previous studies reported that ZnO performed better photocatalytic degradation efficiency for removing organic pollutants than that TiO2, which was caused by the effective charge transport on its large surface area [27]. Nevertheless, pure ZnO photocatalyst usually exhibits low photo-sensitivity and a high rate of electron-hole recombination, hence, resulting in limiting its usability in large-scale application of the photocatalytic process. Theoretically, to achieve better performance of the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts, the electron-hole recombination rate should be maintained as low as possible.",n
"Several studies to improve the performance of photocatalysts have been reported, including compounding, doping, decorating, and catalyzer carrier [27,28]. Those methods have been implemented to enhance the photocatalytic properties of ZnO. Constructing heterojunction structures on ZnO with other semiconductors to engineer the photo-sensitivity bandgap energy seems to be an effective method. This method can also reduce the electron-hole recombination rate and subsequently enhance the photodegradation efficiency of the ZnO-based photocatalyst. There are some materials that are widely used as complementary photocatalysts to construct the heterojunction structure, such as carbon nitride (C3N4) [29], reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [30], GO [31], and manganese oxide (MnO2) [28], WO3[32], and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) [33]. Some studies also investigated those noble metals (Au, Ag, and Pt) and transition metals (Fe, Cr, and Mn) can enhance the photocatalytic degradation of various dyes [34]. Amongst those, MnO2 has gained significant attention as a complementary photocatalyst, supercapacitor material, and lithium-ion battery additive. This is due to its immense natural availability, outstanding electrochemical characteristics, low bandgap energy, and high specific capacitance. By integrating MnO2 with conventional semiconductors such as ZnO, the photo-induced electrons of the semiconductor are transferred and captured by the MnO2 structure, which restrains the possibility of electron-hole recombination. The embedded MnO2 particles can also reduce the overall bandgap energy of the composite by inducing oxygen vacancies in the lattice structure of ZnO [35]. Moreover, the embedded MnO2 can also improve the photocatalytic properties by increasing the lifetime photo-induced charge transport and enhancing the charge transfer process.",n
"Furthermore, efficient photocatalysts should have a large surface area to provide massive active sites for photocatalysis. Silicon dioxide (SiO2) has been widely utilized as catalyst support for semiconductor photocatalysts [34,36]. The incorporation of SiO2 influences some fundamental characteristics of TiO2 and improves its photocatalytic properties [34,36]. Balachandran and coworkers reported that the specific surface area improved from 65 m2/g for TiO2 to 75 m2/g for TiO2/SiO2 composite [37]. Moreover, the addition of SiO2 into TiO2 improved the thermal stability of the TiO2/SiO2 composite, thus, inhibiting the TiO2's crystalline conversion from the anatase into the rutile phase [38]. Utilizing SiO2 as catalyst support also provides pollutant adsorption that brings the pollutant molecules closer to the active sites of the catalyst, thus resulting in a higher rate of photodegradation [39]. Due to these advantages, SiO2 was selected as the catalyst support to enhance the photocatalytic ability of the synthesized ZnO-MnO2 catalyst.",n
"Basically, performing photocatalytic properties on the membrane's surface can provide a simultaneous filtration and photocatalytic process at a single time. Furthermore, the membrane process is susceptible to fouling formation; therefore, performing the photocatalytic process on the membrane's surface can also prevent fouling formation by degrading the attached foulants with the generated radical molecules, which can provide overall membrane performance improvements. In this present study, the MnO2 doping into ZnO with SiO2 as the matrix (ZnO-MnO2@SiO2) composite was synthesized via the sol-gel process, and the membranes were prepared using the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The synthesized photocatalyst composite was expected to improve the photocatalytic activity, hydrophilicity, and antifouling performance of the modified PSf membrane. Based on our review, none has conducted the study regarding synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation of the UV light-driven photocatalytic PSf membrane incorporated by ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite as the photocatalyst for simultaneous membrane filtration and photocatalytic process for NRW treatment. This study explored, evaluated, and compared the membrane performance in dark conditions and under UV light exposure. The photodegradation performance, photocatalytic degradation kinetics, effects of scavengers, and photocatalytic mechanisms of the membranes were also investigated. Therefore, this study can provide a better option for enhancing photocatalysts activity to improve the overall membrane performance, which can prolong the membrane's lifetime for a reliable method of NRW treatment.",n

"The sol-gel method was applied with some modifications to synthesize the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite [40,41]. Firstly, 25 g of SiO2 was constantly mixed in a 125 mL NaOH 2 M for 2 h at 150 degC. After the mixture cooled down, it was filtered through a filter paper (Whatman No. 42) to separate the undissolved SiO2 from the mixture. Then, 1.25 g of ZnO and 1.25 g of MnO2 were added to 25 mL of the filtrate solution, and it was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed into an ultrasonic homogenizer at a frequency of 50 kHz for 60 min in order to get better particle dispersions. Dilute solution containing HCl 1 M was added dropwise into the mixture under constant stirring until the mixture turned into gels. The gels were left overnight for the compaction process. Subsequently, the spent solution was removed from the gels using a vacuum filter, and the damp gels were dried in an oven at 110 degC for 12 h. The dried gels were calcinated in a furnace at 500 degC for 5 h to remove the remaining organic substances and bonded water molecules and activate the photocatalysts. Then, it was crushed using a planetary ball mill machine, and the product was sieved to get finer powders.",y
"The composite membranes were fabricated by referring to the (NIPS) process [42,43]. Table 2 shows the variation of membrane compositions prepared in this study. In the beginning, a certain amount of PSf pellets were mixed into a 50 mL of NMP solvent until the PSf pellets wholly dissolved. Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife. Then, the casted solution was immersed in a DI water bath to form the membrane sheets, and it was left for 24 h to remove the spent solvent inside the membrane. Finally, membrane sheets were dried at an ambient condition.",y
"The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL Series, JSM-6510-LA, Japan) was used to observe the surface micromorphology and cross-section images of as-synthesized photocatalysts and the fabricated membranes. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX, JEOL Series, Japan) was performed to capture the chemical composition, including elemental and oxide contents of the fabricated membrane. The particle size distribution of the photocatalyst was determined using a laser particle size analyzer (PSA, Labtron Instruments, UK). The atomic force microscopy (AFM, Hitachi, Japan) was applied for the fabricated membranes' surface roughness and topography observation. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR, Perkin Elmer, USA) was used to characterize the chemical functional groups of as-synthesized photocatalysts and the fabricated membranes. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to investigate the crystalline structure and crystal phases of the photocatalysts and the fabricated membranes. The diffractograms were recorded using Cu Ka at 30 mA and 30 kV with a scanning speed of 3deg min-1 for a diffraction angle (2th) of 10deg-70deg.",n
"The assessment of photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles and the optical analysis of diffuse reflectance spectrometry (DRS) was carried out. It was performed using a UV-vis (ultraviolet-visible) spectrophotometer (UV-vis Spectrophotometer, Shimadzu, Japan) and conducted at 250-700 nm. This analysis provided the absorbance interaction of the nanoparticles upon the photon energy from different wavelengths ranging from UV to visible light spectra. The energy gaps of the nanoparticle were then estimated using the method of Tauc plot. Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET, Quantachrome, Switzerland) with nitrogen (N2) as working gas was applied to observe the hysteresis loop, sorption behavior, and the specific surface area of the photocatalysts.",n
"The porosity measurement of the membrane was carried out by immersing the membrane for 24 h in DI water and recording the final weight of the membrane. Afterward, the membranes were placed in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 degC, and the dry weight of the membrane was measured. Finally, the membrane porosity was calculated using Eq. (1)[42].(1)e=wt-worwxAxdx100%Where e is the membrane porosity (%), while wt and wo represent the weights (g) of the wet and dry membranes, respectively. rw shows the water density at room temperature (0.997 g.cm-3); A corresponds to the effective surface area (cm-2); d represents the membrane thickness (cm).",n
"Additionally, the average pore radius was analyzed using the Guerout-Elford-Ferry approximation by Eq. (2)[42].(2)r=8edQx(2.9-1.75e)exAxDPWhere e shows the water viscosity at room temperature (8.9 x 10-4 Pa.s), d represents the membrane thickness (m), Q is the volumetric flow rate of the permeate (m3.s-1), and DP shows the trans-membrane pressure (Pa).",n
"The material testing machine (UTS H001, China) was used to conduct membrane mechanical strength measurements based on thickness, tensile strength, and elongation break. The measurement was subjected to a 5 x 5 cm2 flat sheet membrane sample. The sample was placed on a sample holder and carefully clamped. The sample was stretched, and the elongation rate was fixed at 20 mm/min. The measurements were subjected to each membrane sample in triplicates. A contact angle meter (OCA25 Dataphysics Instrument GmBH, Germany) was used to measure a static contact angle and surface energy using the sessile drop method. The DI water at 25 degC was used as a probe liquid. The water was dripped on the membrane surface. After 3 s, its contact angle was measured. The contact angle measurement was conducted several times to obtain reproducible measurement results. The water uptake value of fabricated membranes was calculated using Eq. (3)[42].(3)WU=ww-wdwdx100%Where WU is the water uptake (%), ww and wd are the wet and dry weights (g) of the tested membrane.",n
"The photocatalytic-filtration (photo-filtration) performance of the fabricated membranes was evaluated based on the permeate flux and pollutants removal in NRW photo-filtration process. The photo-filtration test was conducted using a prototype of a membrane filtration system equipped with a feed tank, a pump, pressure gauge, a permeate collector, and a membrane cell modified with a UV lamp (Philips TUV- 30-watt, Netherland). Fig. 1(a) shows the photo-filtration cross-flow module setup used in this experiment. The UV lamp can be easily turned on or off to perform, whether on dark or UV exposure filtration. The actual sample of NRW was used as the feed for evaluating the permeate flux and pollutants rejection, which focused on phenol, COD, and NH3-N removals.",n
"Before measuring the wastewater flux analysis, the membrane was acclimated using deionized water for 30 min. This test was performed at 5 bar trans-membrane pressure with a membrane area of 12.57 cm2. The permeate flux was recorded every 30 min for 3.5 h for each membrane. The membrane water flux values were then calculated using Eq. (4).(4)J=VA.tWhere J and V are the permeate water flux (L.m-2.h-1) and the volume of the permeate (L). At the same time, A and t are effective membrane area (m2) and filtration time (h), respectively.",n
"The phenol, COD, and NH3-N concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined using reagents of HACH 183699, dichromate, and HI3824-025, respectively. The following Eq. (5) was used to calculate membrane pollutant rejection.(5)R=(1-CPCF)x100%Where R is rejection efficiency (%), Cp and Cf are the concentration (mg/L) of the pollutant in permeate and feed solution, respectively.",n
"The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membranes was evaluated by assessing the phenol, COD, and NH3-N degradations rate using the sample of NRW as the feed. Firstly, 100 mL of NRW sample was diluted by adding 100 mL of DI water to reduce the pollutant concentration and make the countable photocatalytic degradation by the membrane composites. The membrane sheet of 5 cm in diameter was mounted onto the glass holder and was immersed into 100 mL of NRW sample. This experiment was carried out in a dark and closed chamber equipped with a UV lamp. The distance between the wastewater and the UV lamp was 10 cm. The complete illustration of the batch photocatalytic test setup can be seen in Fig. 1(b). Before the UV lamp was turned on, the membrane was immersed for 60 min in order to achieve the adsorption equilibrium state for ensuring that only the photocatalytic process was assayed. This photocatalytic process was conducted for 120 min, and COD, NH3-N, and phenol removals were measured every 20 min. The photocatalytic degradation kinetics using the composite membranes were further evaluated by applying the zero order and pseudo-first order kinetic models. The mathematical expressions of the applied kinetic models are represented in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), respectively [44].(6)Co-Ct=kot(7)lnCoCt=k1tWhere Co and Ct represent the concentrations of pollutants at initial (mg/L) and at a specific time (mg/L), ko (mg L-1 min-1) and k1 (min-1) symbolize the rate constants of zero-order and pseudo-first order kinetic models, and t is the operating time (min).",n
"In this study, trapping tests were performed to investigate further the relevance, existence, and relative activity of the reactive species on pollutant degradations. Oxalic acid, benzoquinone, and methanol were used as the scavengers for holes, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively [45]. The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membranes was tested in a 100 mL NRW sample containing 2 mmol of the scavengers at 30 degC for 120 min under UV irradiation. After that, the concentration of phenol, COD, and NH3-N was measured to understand the effect of scavengers on the photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membranes.",n
"The stability test in terms of permeate flux and pollutant removal was carried out by performing filtration in the dark mode and under UV light irradiation for 15 h (900 min). The permeate flux was measured every 30 min, and the pollutant removal was analyzed at the end of the filtration process. To assess the fabricated membranes' reusability, three straight cycle experiments on permeate flow and pollutant removal were performed. The membrane was utilized in the filtering experiment for 3 x 210 min under UV light irradiation, with the permeate flow being collected every 30 min. The membrane was submerged in DI water for 30 min at the end of each cycle. After that, the membrane was gently cleansed with a water sprayer to remove any adherent dirt before being utilized again for the next cycle of testing. Three consecutive cycle tests were also conducted to evaluate the photocatalytic stability of the tested membranes. The approach for determining photocatalytic activity is the same as in section 2.6. The membrane was soaked in DI water for 30 min in between cycles before being employed in the following cycle test. The NRW sample was renewed to assure that the initial pollutant condition was the same in every cycle experiment.",n
"Using a resistance in series model, the resistance during filtration was assessed. The model considers all types of membrane fouling resistance, including intrinsic resistance (Rm), adsorption resistance (Ra), deposition resistance (Rd), and concentration polarization (Rcp), as the complete formula are shown in Eqs. (8)-(11), respectively [46].(8)Rm=DPexJi(9)Ra=DPexJa-Rm(10)Rd=DPexJf-Rm-Ra(11)Rcp=DPexJv-Rm-Ra-RdWhere DP is the trans-membrane pressure (Pa), e is pure water viscosity (Pa.s), Ji, Ja, Jf, and Jv are the initial membrane pure water flux (PWF) (L.m-2h-1), the measured PWF after fouled by static adsorption (L.m-2h-1), the PWF after fouled by actual NRW (L.m-2h-1), and the measured flux when operating in actual NRW filtration (L.m-2h-1), respectively.",n
"The effect of UV irradiation on composite membranes for producing photocatalytic activity can also be ascribed to the reduction of membrane fouling which is known as the antifouling properties. The total fouling ratio (RT), reversible fouling ratio (RR), irreversible fouling ratio (RIr), and flux recovery ratio (FRR) of the fabricated membranes were measured as the mathematical formula are given in Eqs. (12)-(15), respectively [46].(12)RT=Ji-JwJcx100%(13)RR=Jc-JwJix100%(14)RIr=Ji-JcJix100%(15)FRR=JcJix100%Where Ji, Jc, and Jw are the initial PWF (L.m-2h-1), PWF after cleaning (L.m-2h-1), and the permeate flux of wastewater (L.m-2h-1), respectively.",n
"Several analyses were performed to characterize the prepared photocatalyst composites. Fig. 2(a) depicts the micromorphology of the prepared ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. The irregular structure dominates the micromorphology of this composite. Some aggregations can still be observed in the SEM image. This possibly occurred due to the high tendency of tiny particles to stick with others [47]. The elemental and oxide composition of the as-synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite were characterized using EDX, and the results are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that the composite mainly consisted of 24.13 %, 13.10 %, and 15.14 % of SiO2, ZnO, and MnO2, respectively, with low content of impurities such as sodium (Na) and copper (Cu) with compositions of 0.13 % and 0.81 %, respectively. The recorded Na and Cu compositions can be promoted by the tiny amount of Na and Cu in the SiO2 as the matrix material of the composite. Since the content is not significant, the negative impacts of the Na and Cu presence on the photocatalytic properties of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 can be neglected. The detected significant Zn and Mn signals in the EDX results revealed that the doping of ZnO and MnO2 into the SiO2 matrix was successful. Fig. 2(b) shows the particle size distribution of the synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. This composite has various sizes of particle that distribute from 20 to 180 nm, and particle size of 60-80 nm dominates the distribution. It is also found that the average size of the composite is 78.54 nm. Smaller particle size is possible to facilitate a larger surface area of the active sites, thus can generate better photocatalytic performance. FTIR analysis was used to characterize the contained functional groups of the composite, as the results are compiled in Fig. 2(c). In all spectra, the fingerprint region that corresponds to the metal oxide bonds is observed at the wavenumber of 600 to 400 cm-1[48]. Moreover, a broad absorption peak at 1000 cm-1 that can be observed in the spectra of pristine MnO2 and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite indicates the presence of Mn-O bonds [28]. A sharp peak at around 500 cm in ZnO and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite correlates to the presence of Zn-O bonds [48]. These observed peaks that correspond to the presence of Zn-O and Mn-O groups in the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite indicate success attachments of ZnO and MnO2 in the composite.",n
"To further understand the characteristics of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite, an XRD analysis was carried out. XRD results present the diffractograms that correlate with the crystalline structure of the tested samples. Fig. 2(d) reflects the diffractograms of SiO2, ZnO, MnO2, and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. Based on the results, it is found that SiO2 and MnO2 seem to have an amorphous structure. Despite this, SiO2 show two sharp peaks at 33.21deg and 45.63deg that indicate the crystallite of SiO2[49]. Some small peaks are also observed in the diffractogram of MnO2, which closely correlates to the birnessite crystal phase of MnO2[27]. In contrast, the diffractogram of ZnO shows a lot of significant peaks. The peaks in the ZnO's diffraction pattern can be related to the wurtzite crystal structure phase based on the card number of JCPDS No. 0036-1451. Moreover, the XRD pattern of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite is dominantly attributed to that of ZnO, with also contains the patterns of MnO2 and SiO2, which signifies the coexistence of ZnO and MnO2 crystallite sites. This indicates the successful formation of the heterostructure of the composite [50]. It is also found that the peak intensity of standard ZnO is reduced in the synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite, which is caused by the more intense reflections due to the entrapped other oxides (MnO2 and SiO2) in the ZnO structures. This phenomenon corresponds to the formation of the heterostructure in the photocatalyst composite. Overall, the XRD results agree well with the previous FTIR results to support the successful doping of ZnO and MnO2 in the photocatalyst.",n
"BET-BJH analysis was used to show the sorption properties of the photocatalysts and their specific surface area, as shown in Fig. 2(e). Based on the results, the sorption isotherms of N2 for all photocatalysts are attributed as type IV with H3 hysteresis loop characteristics [51]. It suggests that the pore characteristics of all samples can be classified as mesoporous material, indicated by the quite noticeable envelope shape in the hysteresis loops. The mesoporous material has a pore size of 2-50 nm, which is usually associated with the detected pores as the gaps between nanoparticles. Furthermore, the BET surface areas of the photocatalysts were 182, 207, and 254 m2/g for ZnO, MnO2, and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. This result indicates that the synthesized ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite has the largest BET surface area among others, which correlated to the utilization of SiO2 as the composite's matrix, thus providing a larger surface area. These findings are also in a similar shape to previously reported studies that also used SiO2 as the catalysts support [52]. The larger surface area of a photocatalyst might provide massive active sites for the photocatalytic process and enhance the degradation performance. The surface area also plays a crucial role in pollutant adsorption prior the photocatalytic degradation.",n
"The DRS analysis was performed to understand the light absorption behavior of the photocatalysts under UV-vis spectra. Fig. 2(f) depicts the response of the photocatalysts to light absorbance upon irradiation of UV-vis spectra. It can be seen that each sample shows a different response trend. SiO2 seems to not have an active light absorption either in UV or visible regions. ZnO shows a significant absorbance in the UV region, while MnO2 presents an active behavior in the visible light region. Meanwhile, the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite shows the light absorption activity in a region between pristine ZnO and MnO2. However, by looking it closer, the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite has the highest absorption of the light spectrum in a wavelength of around 350 nm, which is still in the UV light region. Therefore, the photocatalytic experiment should be performed using UV light irradiation instead of visible light irradiation. The bandgap energies of the photocatalysts were estimated using the Tauc plots, as depicted in Fig. 2(g). It can be observed that SiO2 has an undetected bandgap value, as previously suggested by the DRS results. Previous works reported that SiO2 has extremely high bandgap energy with approximately 5.00 eV [39]; thus, it cannot be estimated using standard light spectra of 250-700 nm. Pristine ZnO has a bandgap energy of 3.10 eV, indicating that the photocatalytic process should be performed under UV light conditions. Pristine MnO2 shows a bandgap of 2.20 eV, as shown by the significant light absorption in the visible light region. The ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite has a bandgap value of 2.65 eV, which is lower than that of pristine ZnO and SiO2 but higher than the pristine MnO2. This reduction of the bandgap value of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite is desirable and is reasonably caused by the incorporation of MnO2. However, despite the fact that the pristine MnO2 has the lowest bandgap energy, it does not reflect the best photocatalytic properties. It is due to a single element photocatalyst tends to have a higher electron-hole recombination rate, which is not satisfying [53]. Indeed, the main goal of MnO2 integration into the composite is to reduce the bandgap energy of the composite by inducing the oxygen vacancies in the lattice structure of ZnO and creating the heterojunction photocatalytic mechanism to reduce the electron-hole recombination [35]. This finding suggests that the doping of MnO2 into ZnO can influence the light absorption behavior of the synthesized composite and result in lower bandgap energy. The lower bandgap energy indicates that the photocatalyst requires lower photon energy to perform the photocatalysis, thus can improve the photocatalytic performance of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite.",n
"The surface and cross-sectional images of the neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes are compiled in Fig. 3. Based on the results in Fig. 3(a), it is found that the surface morphology of the neat PSf is relatively smooth, with some defects spotted. These defects might be formed due to different coagulation rates of polysulfone in the defect spots compared to the whole membrane surface during the phase inversion process. The embedded photocatalysts, i.e., ZnO, MnO2, and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, on the surface of the modified membranes are observed, as shown in Fig. 1(b-d), respectively. The photocatalysts appear as tiny dots across the membranes' surface. The embedded photocatalyst on the membrane surface will become active under UV light irradiation to perform the photocatalytic process for pollutant degradations. For the cross-sectional structure, the neat PSf membrane attributed a sponge-like structure with spotted microvoid structures. This sponge-like structure reflects a low membrane's porosity due to a denser structure. It is found that the cross-sectional morphologies of the modified membranes with photocatalysts are significantly different from that of the neat PSf. The modified membranes attributed a similar finger-like structure to their cross-sectional morphologies. The finger-like structure is a typical characteristic of the cross-sectional morphology of membranes that are prepared using the NIPS method [54]. The finger-like structure formed right after the coagulation process, which separated the solvent and polymer. Polymer rich phase turned into a membrane matrix, whereas solvent rich phase turned into membrane pores that were usually in the form of finger-like structure. It is also found that PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 have fine constructed finger-like structures. It can be seen that the modified membranes with photocatalysts have a more massive pore structure compared to the neat PSf membrane. The massive pore structure possibly leads to creating higher membrane porosity, water uptake, and permeability [55]; thus, the modified membranes can perform better filtration performance. The embedded photocatalysts are found in the pore structure of the modified membranes, which is desirable to enhance membrane hydrophilicity. The synergetic effects of photocatalysts on the membrane's surface, the finger-like structure, and embedded photocatalysts in the membrane's pore structure are helpful in generating a significant improvement in the filtration process.",n
"To characterize the membranes' compositions, EDX analysis was performed, as the chemical compositions of neat PSf and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 are collected in Table 4. From the results, it is found that the neat PSf membrane is composed of 83.45 % of carbon (C), 11.09 % of oxygen (O), and 5.46 % of sulfur (S). Meanwhile, after the addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite into the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, the membrane's composition significantly changed. Some new elementals are found in the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane's composition, including silicon (Si), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) with compositions of 0.22 %, 0.52 %, 0.34 %, and 0.06 %, respectively. These newly recorded elementals have correlations with the oxide compositions that contained the key oxide substances, i.e., SiO2, ZnO, and MnO2. These new recorded compounds also reflect that the addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst into the membrane was successful. Another essential piece of information from the EDX analysis is that the oxygen composition in the membrane increased after the addition of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst, meaning that the modified membrane contains richer oxygenated compounds. The rich oxygenated compounds on the membrane surface can enhance the membrane's hydrophilicity that leading to permeability improvement. In addition, the interfacial interaction between PSf and ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst is physical interaction that has a similar photocatalyst-polymer interaction with other reported studies [46,56,57]. Photocatalyst particles are attached physically to the matrix of PSf. It is obvious from the SEM images of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are no side reactions between photocatalyst and PSf matrix.",n
"Furthermore, EDX mapping distribution characterization is used to show the key elemental distribution in the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Fig. 4(a-f) reflect the elemental distributions of C, O, S, Zn, Mn, and Si, respectively. The dense distribution of C, O, and S confirms that the membrane is constructed by polysulfone, which is consisted of C, O, and S, as previously presented in Table 4. Furthermore, it can be seen that the elemental distributions across the membrane's surface are dispersed uniformly. The combined distribution of Zn, Mn, and Si also shows the remarkably well-dispersed elemental distribution, as represented in Fig. 4(g-h). The prominent dispersion of photocatalysts on the membrane surface can prevent particle aggregations. In this study, the photocatalyst dispersion is obtained by performing a constant agitation and conducting a 60,000 Hz ultrasonic homogenizer prior to the membrane casting. The ultrasonic waves are responsible for making the photocatalyst's dispersion in the dope solution, hence, preventing the agglomeration of the photocatalyst's particles. In the conventional membrane filtration, uniformly distributed photocatalyst on the membrane's surface controlled the surface hydrophilicity, while in the photocatalytic filtration, the uniform photocatalyst distribution also provides more extensive availability of active sites across the membrane's surface to boost the photodegradation of the pollutants. This photodegradation mechanism on the membrane's surface is helpful in fouling mitigation, thus, can improve the membrane's performance and durability.",n
"AFM analysis was used to investigate the surface roughness of the neat PSf and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, as the results are presented in Fig. 5. The brighter region on the images reflects the relatively higher area, whereas the darker region means vice-versa. In two-dimension surface profiles, some quantitative properties are estimated, including the average surface roughness (Sa), root mean square of height data (Sq), and the height difference between the lowest and the highest peak (Sz). It can be seen that the neat PSf membrane attributed to a relatively smooth surface with 0.473 nm in Sa and 7.21 in Sz. In contrast, the modified PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane shows a rougher surface with a Sa value of 1.70 nm and Sz value of 31.7 nm, which is approximately 3.5 times rougher surface than that of the neat PSf membrane, as shown in the three-dimensional AFM images (right side). The increment in surface roughness can be caused by the relative porosity of the membrane and a change of interaction between solvent and non-solvent in the presence of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite. A membrane with a rougher surface possesses a larger filtration area [58]; thus, it can increase the membrane's permeability. The rougher membrane surface also reflects the presence of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalysts. The peak distribution is distributed uniformly, as it agrees well with the EDX mapping results and also indicates the massive availability of the active sites to perform the photocatalytic process.",n
"The crystalline structure of the neat PSf and modified PSf membranes with embedded photocatalysts were characterized using XRD analysis, as the results are represented in Fig. 6. It is found that the diffractogram patterns of all membranes show a similar pattern as the neat PSf. The patterns of all membranes exhibit a broad peak around diffraction angle from 15deg to 20deg [59]. This broad peak is a typical peak indicating the polysulfone polymer's backbone. The neat PSf membrane possesses a smooth diffractogram pattern without any distinct peaks, indicating that the neat PSf membrane is constructed by an amorphous polymer structure that is free from any crystal structure. Meanwhile, the modified membranes with photocatalysts addition demonstrate some tiny peaks on their diffractogram patterns, suggesting the presence of some crystallite sites from the photocatalysts on the polymer structures. For example, the diffractogram of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exhibits some tiny peaks at diffractogram angles of 31deg and 37deg that indicate the crystallite sites of ZnO, and a peak at 49deg signifies the crystallite of MnO2[27,28]. The observed weak tiny peaks can be associated with the uniformly dispersed photocatalyst across the membrane; thus, the detected peaks were not entirely prominent. This finding is supported by the EDX mapping results, as previously discussed.",n
"FTIR analysis was performed to analyze the developed functional groups in the fabricated membranes over a frequency range of 4000-450 cm-1. The FTIR spectra for the neat PSf and modified PSf membranes with embedded photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 7. It can be visually observed that all the FTIR spectra of the membranes have a similar pattern, meaning that the membranes were constructed with the same polymer. The observed peaks consistently reflect the typical functional groups of polysulfone, such as a peak at 1585 cm-1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of CH groups, and peaks at 1448 and 1241 cm-1 that belong to the stretching vibrations of OS = O groups of polysulfone [42]. From FTIR spectrum of M-04, which is PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, shows notable small peaks at 2974 and 1074 cm-1, which correspond to the Zn-O and Mn-O bonds, respectively, confirming the existence of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite.",n
"Pore properties characterization is important to evaluate the effect of photocatalyst loading on the physical properties of the fabricated membranes. Evaluations of thickness, porosity, and average pore size of the membranes are essential because these parameters cause some influences on the permeability, sorption of water, selectivity, and even the fouling tendency of the fabricated membranes [55]. Table 5 summarizes the results regarding the pore properties of the membranes. It is found that the photocatalysts doping increased the thickness of the fabricated membranes, from 35.43 um for the neat PSf to 46.31, 43.70, and 45.83 um for PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2. This can be caused by the swelling effects in the polymer structure of the membranes upon the addition of photocatalysts, thus, resulting in thicker membrane layers. The porosity parameter shows a similar trend with the thickness. The porosity of the membranes significantly increased with the addition of photocatalysts, from 42.16 % for the neat PSf to 63.13, 56.33, and 72.31 % for PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. The higher porosity of the modified membranes is promoted by the creation of void sites in the membrane body when phase inversion occurs. The photocatalysts are helpful in creating more gaps in the membrane body during phase inversion. These findings are also evident in the cross-sectional morphology of the membranes. The membranes with embedded photocatalysts have a similar porous and finger-like structure that makes it possible to create a more porous structure, as previously discussed. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane possessed the highest porosity among other membranes, indicating that the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite can provide higher void formation during the phase inversion process compared to the pristine ZnO and MnO2. Membranes with higher porosity can perform better sorption of water and hydrophilicity, which can improve permeability. Additionally, the membranes' average pore radii were evaluated. Based on the results, it can be observed that the addition of photocatalysts into the membranes causes a slight increment in the average pore size from 40.32 nm for the neat PSf to 48.11, 45.78, and 42.76 nm for PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. This phenomenon can be correlated as the side effect of the gap formations due to the doping of photocatalysts. The formed gaps in the membrane's body are possible to increase the distribution of wider pores, which results in the larger average pore size of the modified membranes. Naturally, membranes with bigger pore sizes can generate lower selectivity. Nevertheless, the rise of the membrane's pore size is not too extreme; therefore, the negative impacts of pore size rising are not significant. It is also noteworthy that all membranes can be classified into ultrafiltration (UF) types since their average pore sizes still fall in the range of 10 to 100 nm.",n
"Mechanical strength analysis is quite critical to show the robustness of the membrane when they are used in the actual filtration condition. The membranes' mechanical properties also have correlations with the durability and service life during application for wastewater treatment. The membranes' mechanical properties, including tensile strength and elongation at break were evaluated, as the results are depicted in Fig. 8(a). It is found that the tensile strengths of the membranes are 4.73, 4.31, 4.26, and 4.68 MPa, and the elongation at breaks values of 45.03, 42.30, 38.72, and 43.70 % for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Based on the results, it can be seen that the addition of photocatalysts relatively reduced the tensile strength and elongation at break of the membranes. This phenomenon is explainable that the photocatalyst sites in the polymer matrix create gaps between the polymer structure, which then weaken the polymer chains [60]. Corroboratively, based on the EDX and XRD results, they signify the presence of the crystallite sites in the modified membranes upon the photocatalyst addition. Due to the more gaps formed and the presence of crystallite sites, the polymer matrix structure becomes weaker, more brittle, and less elastic, which results in a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break. The modified membranes PSf/ZnO and PSf/MnO2 have a little bit lower mechanical strength compared to that of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. It is explainable by the SEM results that found some aggregation structure of the photocatalysts in the cross-sectional image of PSf/ZnO and PSf/MnO2 membranes. The aggregations create gaps between the polysulfone matrix and weaken the mechanical strength of the membrane, while in the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, the photocatalyst dispersion is much better. Hence, the mechanical properties of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane are better than the other two modified membranes. Furthermore, previous studies suggested not to add inorganic fillers with a concentration of >2 %-wt because it can reduce the membrane's mechanical strength and also possibly cause agglomerations [61]. Nonetheless, the decrease of mechanical properties in the modified membranes was not too bad. Since the applied pressure on filtration was set at 5 bar (~0.5 MPa), which is still far below the critical tensile strength of all membranes; thus, the membranes' mechanical strength is acceptable, and all membranes can still be applied for the filtration process.",n
"Hydrophilicity is an essential characteristic of membrane-based technology for water and wastewater treatment applications. The hydrophilicity of the membranes explains the surface behavior of the water molecules. In this present work, the hydrophilicity of the membranes was examined using water contact angle measurement, as the results are depicted in Fig. 8(b). It is found that the water contact angles of the membranes were 81.55deg, 71.43deg, 73.21deg, and 65.59deg for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, respectively. It can be seen that with the photocatalysts' addition, the water contact angle was significantly reduced. The lower value of water contact angle means a more hydrophilic surface characteristic. Hydrophilic membrane surface can generate more permeate water and also can mitigate the fouling tendency, especially for highly polluted wastewater [62]. The neat PSf membrane possessed the lowest water contact angle, suggesting that the natural character of polysulfone is less hydrophilic; thus, it is not recommended to use the pristine PSf membrane without any modifications for wastewater treatment purposes. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane appeared as the most hydrophilic membrane, suggesting the lowest contact angle among other membranes. This can be due to the rich contained oxygenated groups such as Zn-O and Mn-O and the uniformly dispersed ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst sites on the surface of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, as revealed by FTIR, XRD, and EDX mapping results. The rich oxygenated groups and photocatalyst sites perform strong attraction van der Waals forces to the water molecules, thus, subsequently can enhance the membrane's permeability [62,63]. The better hydrophilicity of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane compared to PSf/ZnO and PSf/MnO2 is promoted by the higher surface energy. Fig. 8(c) shows the estimated surface energy of the fabricated membranes. The estimated surface energies were 6.73, 23.54, 19.60, and 44.17 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Surface energy shows the magnitude of attraction force of the surface towards water molecules [64]. Higher surface energy correlates with the hydrophilic surface; thus, the membrane with higher surface energy has better hydrophilicity (lower contact angle). In a similar shape, the water uptake ability improved on the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. It is found that the water uptake abilities were 39.77 %, 65.22 %, 61.75 %, and 70.43 % for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. The neat PSf possessed the lowest, whereas PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 showed the highest water uptake ability. Hydrophilicity and porosity play an equally dominant for the sorption ability. The PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 showed outstanding hydrophilicity and porosity; thus, the water molecules can rapidly fill the void space inside the membrane. This intense water sorption ability can also be helpful in enhancing the membrane's permeability.",n
"Initial checking of the effect of photocatalytic properties of the membranes on the membrane performance was carried out by determining pure water flux (PWF). The filtration experiments were performed by filtering DI water for 120 min and were carried out in the dark and under UV light irradiation conditions. Fig. 8(d) presents the results of PWF for all membranes. In the dark filtration condition, it can be observed that the PWF value is higher in the modified membranes with photocatalysts compared to the neat PSf. The measured average PWF values were 17.43, 26.35, 23.28, and 28.74 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Under UV light irradiation conditions, PWF values further increase only in the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. The measured PWFs under UV light irradiation was 17.58, 29.01, 25.21, 31.97 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 for respectively. These findings indicate that UV irradiation can improve the PWF in the membrane with embedded photocatalysts. The PWF improvement in membranes with embedded photocatalysts is caused by the increase of hydrophilicity during UV light irradiation. In the photocatalyst, the photo-induced holes can oxidize the superoxide radicals and create oxygen vacancies [65,66]. These oxygen vacancies tend to attract water molecules and generate adsorbed hydroxyl (OH) groups, thus enhancing the surface hydrophilicity [64,65]. The higher surface hydrophilicity led to providing a stronger attraction force to water molecules [64], which resulted in an improved PWF.",n
"Permeability profiles upon treating NRW using the fabricated membranes in the dark (conventional) and under UV light irradiation were thoroughly studied. The conventional filtration in the dark environment was conducted as the control variable, whereas the UV light irradiation was aimed to initiate the photocatalytic reaction on the membrane's surface. Fig. 9(a-d) compile the permeability profiles of neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, respectively, in the dark and under UV light irradiation conditions. It is found that the neat PSf membrane (MM-01) shows insignificant permeability profile differences between in the dark and under UV light conditions. It obviously signifies that pristine PSf polymer is not a photocatalytic material. Meanwhile, improvements in permeability are observed in the membrane with the embedded photocatalysts. The modified membranes with embedded photocatalysts show distinct improvements in permeability after being irradiated by UV light. The UV light irradiation seems to have significant effects on increasing the permeability of the modified membranes. In the membranes with a single photocatalyst, PSf/ZnO membrane (MM-02) exhibited better permeability than that of PSf/MnO2 (MM-03) in the dark and under UV light irradiation. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 exhibited the best and most stable permeability performance among other membranes. This membrane achieved a permeate flux of 23.54 L.m-2.h-1 in the dark condition, then improved to 27.31 L.m-2.h-1 when it was performed under UV light irradiation condition, as depicted in Fig. 9(d).",n
"It is also found that the modified membranes with embedded photocatalysts not only performed better permeability in photo-filtration conditions but also enhanced the permeability in conventional dark filtration conditions compared to the neat PSf membrane. This occurrence can be caused by some reasons. First, the embedded photocatalysts increase the surface hydrophilicity of the membranes, thus, enhancing the surface attraction forces to the water molecule and then generating higher permeability. Second, the rougher membrane due to photocatalysts addition creates a larger filtration area and increases the contact between water and photocatalysts' sites. Third, the addition of photocatalysts generates higher porosity and water uptake ability; thus, the modified membranes can absorb more water, which results in higher permeate flux. Fourth, when the modified membranes are irradiated under UV light, the photocatalyst initiates a photocatalytic process, which subsequently generates radical molecules to degrade the attached pollutants on the membrane surface; thus, the filtration process is not disturbed by the deposited pollutants. The fifth reason is that the photo-generated holes during photocatalysis can produce the superoxide radicals and create the oxygen vacancies on the active sites [65,66], thus subsequently increasing the surface hydrophilicity and permeability. In conclusion, in the dark filtration condition, surface hydrophilicity, pore properties, sorption ability, and surface roughness control the permeability of the membranes, whereas, in the photo-filtration condition under UV light, the photocatalytic process dominates the control of the permeability of the membranes.",n
"The removal efficiency by membrane filtration was evaluated by measuring the pollutant concentrations at the initial and the end of the process. In this study, NRW was used as the feed water, and the removal efficiency was measured based on some pollutant parameters, including TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N contents. The pollutant removal performance of the neat PSf and modified membranes are shown in Fig. 10. It can be observed that the membranes with different embedded photocatalysts show different removal abilities. The modified membranes with photocatalysts exhibit higher removal efficiency either in the dark or under UV light conditions compared to that of the neat PSf membrane. Furthermore, UV light irradiation improves the removal efficiencies of the modified membranes. In the dark condition, the neat PSf membrane removes 22.31 %, 18.75 %, 28.73 %, and 20.51 % of TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively. When the UV irradiation was performed in the neat PSf membrane, no noticeable improvements were captured. In contrast, the modified membranes with photocatalysts showed distinct enhancement when they were irradiated by UV light during the filtration experiment. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane presents the best pollutant removal among the other membranes under UV light irradiation and in dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 10(d). In the conventional filtration condition, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exhibits 59.31 %, 53.43 %, 60.18 %, and 58.44 % of TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N removals, respectively, whereas, under UV light irradiation the removal efficiencies increase to 73.26 %, 68.33 %, 78.92 %, and 75.69 % for TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N removals, respectively.",n
"After being performed under UV light irradiation, the improved pollutant removals occurred for some reasons. First, the photocatalytic degradation process can be helpful in improving pollutant removal. The photo-generated radicals, either superoxide (0O2-) or hydroxyl (0OH) in the active sites (embedded photocatalysts), can react with the pollutant molecules by redox reaction and degrade them into small molecules [53]. Second, the defect-free surface and uniformly distributed photocatalyst on the membrane surface are also valuable for performing better pollutant removal. Third, the highly hydrophilic sites on the modified membrane surface also improved the pollutant rejection by performing repulsion forces against the pollutant (organic matter), which usually presents in different polarities [66]. Since the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite shows a prominent semiconductor property by attributing bandgap energy of 2.65 eV, uniformly distributed photocatalysts particles on the membrane surface, and the highly hydrophilic surface, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane appears as the best membrane in pollutant removal compared to other membranes.",n
"Effects of adsorption and photocatalysis on photodegradation performance of the neat PSf and modified membranes were evaluated. This evaluation was done by measuring the pollutant removal, including phenol, COD, and NH3-N, under UV light conditions. The changing of concentration profiles (Ct/Co) for the tested membranes are shown in Fig. 11. It is found that prior to the UV light being turned on, there are small removals that occurred on all three pollutant parameters on the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. The removal before UV light irradiation can correspond to the occurrence of surface adsorption. This finding shows that the active sites of the photocatalysts can also perform pollutant adsorption besides photocatalysis. The rich oxygenated sites on the membrane surface also generate strong van der Waals attraction forces to the charged pollutant molecules, thus, resulting in adsorption performance [64,67]. Interestingly, the membrane embedded by ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 shows a slightly higher adsorption effect compared to other photocatalysts. This result is in agreement with the BET-BJH analysis, which reflects the more comprehensive sorption range and specific surface area that boosted the adsorption performance of the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Moreover, after the UV lamp was turned on, the pollutant degradations significantly improved, specifically in the membranes with embedded photocatalysts. In this state, photocatalysis plays the dominant role in pollutant removals. It is observed that the PSf membrane shows insignificant removal ability during the process, which signifies that the PSf membrane has no photocatalytic characteristics whatsoever. The modified membranes present the improved pollutant removal performance under UV light exposure and strengthen the finding that photocatalysis is far too dominant in the photodegradation of pollutants compared to the adsorption process.",n
"The characteristics of photodegradation of pollutants were evaluated further using two kinetics models, including the zero order and pseudo-first order models. These evaluations were done by determining the pollutants degradation rates of the fabricated membranes. Initially, the membrane sheet was mounted onto the glass holder and immersed in the NRW sample. This experiment was performed in a dark and closed chamber utilized with a UV lamp (see Fig. 1(b)). Before the UV lamp was turned on, the membrane was left in the NRW sample for 60 min in order to achieve the adsorption equilibrium state for ensuring that only the photocatalysis was performed for the pollutant removal. Fig. 12 (a-f) show the fitting plots of degradation kinetic on phenol, COD, and NH3-N removals, respectively, using zero-order and pseudo-first order kinetics, whereas the fitting parameters are listed in Table 6. Based on the results, it is observed that the neat PSf membrane (MM-01) did not show any removal performance under this photocatalytic experiment. The photocatalytic degradations of pollutants remarkably improved in the modified membranes with the embedded photocatalysts (MM-02 - MM-04). In addition, the pollutants' degradation rates of the membranes using both models follow this order: MM-04 > MM-02 > MM-03  MM-01. A higher rate constant represents faster photocatalytic degradation can be obtained. This indicates that the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 has the strongest photocatalytic power compared to other membranes. From the average coefficient of determinations (R2avg), it is found that the pseudo-first order kinetic model is a better fit than the zero order. R2avg values of pseudo-first order are 0.9489, 0.9394, and 0.9668 for phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively, whereas for the zero-order are 0.9401, 0.9338, and 0.9646 for phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively.",n
"In common heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation, reactive species including holes, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals are the main substances to degrade the pollutants. In this study, trapping tests were performed to investigate further the relevance, existence, and relative activity of the reactive species on pollutant degradations. Oxalic acid, benzoquinone, and methanol were used as the scavengers for holes, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively [45]. Fig. 13(a-c) depict the effect of scavengers on phenol, COD, and NH3-N degradations using PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes, respectively. It can be observed that the scavengers reduce the photodegradation efficiency on all membranes. This means that the scavengers disrupt the active species to react with pollutants. The relative order of active species' effects on photocatalytic degradation can be ordered as h+ > 0O2- > 0OH. It is also found that all active species play essential roles in pollutant degradation; eliminating one of them resulted in the reduction of degradation efficiency.",n
"Fig. 14 illustrates the proposed mechanisms of the photocatalytic process using the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite. ZnO-MnO2 plays a vital role in the photocatalysis reaction, while SiO2 provides the adsorption of pollutant molecules to be closer to the photocatalyst, resulting in easier and faster degradation of pollutants [53]. In specific, when the composite is irradiated with photon energy from UV light, the electrons (e-) are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). In the CB, the photo-induced electrons transferred from the higher potential of ZnO to the lower potential of MnO2, while in the VB, the empty sites filled with the photo-induced holes (h+) that transferred from VB of ZnO to VB of MnO2[68]. In Fig. 14(a), it is observed that the CB of MnO2 is more positive than the energy level for superoxide radical (0O2-) generations; hence, the reduction reaction to generate 0O2- has less possibility of taking place on the CB of MnO2. Due to the excellent electron conductivity of MnO2, some electrons reacted with Mn4+ ions to form Mn3+[69]. Then, the Mn3+ ion can react with O2 to form Mn4+ and 0O2-. The VBs of ZnO and MnO2 appear more positive than the potential energy to generate hydroxyl radicals (0OH); therefore, the oxidation reaction can take place, as reflected in Fig. 14(a). In the VB of MnO2, the photo-induced holes reacted with water (H2O) or hydroxyl (OH-) molecules through an oxidation reaction to produce the hydroxyl radicals (0OH). As both generated radicals have strong reactivity, 0O2- and 0OH radicals reacted with pollutants to degrade them and resulting in CO2, H2O, and mineral acids as the products [28]. An illustration of mechanisms of pollutant degradation by the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite by heterojunction pathway under UV light irradiation can be seen in Fig. 14(b). The detailed mechanisms of the photocatalytic process of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 are as follows:",n

"To assess the stability of the flux and pollutant rejection performance, the membranes were used to treat the NRW sample for 15 h, and the flux and pollutant rejection were calculated during this assessment, as the results are shown in Fig. 15(a). Based on Fig. 15(a), it is found that in the dark condition, the pristine PSf membrane (MM-01) experienced an extreme flux reduction during the period from 16.67 L.m-2.h-1 at the beginning of the process and leaving a pseudo-static permeability of 2.02 L.m-2.h-1 after going through 15 h of filtration. Meanwhile, in the same dark condition of filtration, PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane (MM-04) exhibited a significant improvement in the permeability compared to the neat PSf membrane. This membrane experienced a starting flux of 23.50 L.m-2.h-1 and maintained a pseudo-static flux of about 6.89 L.m-2.h-1 afterward. It is explainable by the increase of the membrane's hydrophilicity after being embedded by the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 nanoparticles, which play a key role in boosting the permeability of the membrane, especially in the dark (conventional) filtration condition. However, the membrane still struggled to maintain high and stable permeability, which signifies the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane in the dark condition has a limited capability to tackle fouling formation. Further permeability improvement was observed by irradiating the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane under UV light during the filtration process to carry out the photocatalytic activity of the membrane. It is found that the magnitude of the flux of this membrane is the highest compared to MM-01 (dark) and MM-04 (dark). Under UV light exposure, the membrane achieved an initial flux of 27.12 L.m-2.h-1 and can perfectly maintain a pseudo-static flux of 18.02 L.m-2.h-1 until the end of the filtration period. The UV irradiation on the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane also exhibited an outstanding pollutant removal ability. It is found that the pollutants removal of MM-04 (UV) was 74.31 %, 70.25 %, 80.93 %, and 76.55 % for removals of TDS, phenol, COD, and NH3-N, respectively. This finding suggests that UV irradiation triggered a photocatalysis reaction on the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite on the surface of the membrane, which destroyed the concentrated contaminants, thus, making it easier for water molecules to move through the membrane as well as contributing to improving the pollutant removal performance [70,71].",n
"The reusability test using three consecutive cycles of filtration was performed under UV light irradiation, and the results are presented in Fig. 15(b). At the starting point of the test, the measured permeabilities were 16.67, 23.55, 21.10, and 27.11 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf (MM-01), PSf/ZnO (MM-02), PSf/MnO2 (MM-03), and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 (MM-04), respectively. Based on the results, the neat PSf membrane experienced the lowest permeability and lack of flux recovery in the next cycles, which suggests that the neat PSf membrane is susceptible to fouling. Other membranes with embedded nanoparticles show improvements in the magnitude of permeability and flux recovery ability. After two cycles, the measured permeabilities at the beginning of the third cycle were 9.97, 18.55, 17.82, and 25.33 L.m-2.h-1, whereas, at the end of the cycle test, it was found that the membrane permeabilities were 1.55, 9.45, 7.32, and 17.03 L.m-2.h-1 for neat PSf, PSf/ZnO, PSf/MnO2, and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2, respectively. Hence, it is noteworthy that the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 appears as the best membrane in flux magnitude, stability, retrievability, and reusability compared to other membranes. Fig. 15(c-e) present the results of photocatalytic degradation abilities of the membranes upon three process cycles. It is found that different membranes exhibited different profiles of pollutant degradations. It can be observed that PSf/MnO2 shows the weakest photodegradation ability compared to PSf/ZnO and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2. It can be correlated to the weak absorption capacity of UV light energy by the membrane composite as revealed by UV-vis DRS results, thus, making it struggles to perform the photocatalytic process. On the other hand, PSf/ZnO and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membranes demonstrated the stronger photodegradation ability and retrievability under UV light irradiation. This is strongly correlated due to a strong UV light energy absorption capacity by these membranes [57]. PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 experienced the best pollutant degradation efficiency and showed nice degradation stability in three cycles of the process. Therefore, these results indicate that the fabricated photocatalytic composite membranes, particularly the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane, it has an excellent and long-lasting photocatalytic ability, which is desirable for NRW treatment.",n
"The antifouling properties of the fabricated membranes were evaluated through several parameters, including flux profile under certain conditions, resistance during filtration measurement, flux recovery ratio, and the ratio between reversible and irreversible fouling, as the results are compiled in Fig. 16. Fig. 16(a) represents the results of flux profiles under different conditions of filtration. Ji shows the initial pure water flux, Ja represents the pure water flux after the membrane was immersed in the NRW sample to cause static fouling, Jf represents the pure water flux after the membrane was used for NRW filtration, and Jv is the flux of actual NRW filtration [46]. According to the results, it can be seen that the modified membranes with photocatalysts show higher flux values compared to the neat PSf both in the dark and under UV light exposure, indicating the enhanced antifouling performance of the modified membranes. The maximum flux performance was achieved for the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exposed to UV light irradiation, which can be due to the occurrence of photocatalytic reaction in the nanoparticle composite. This mechanism creates a maximum capability to degrade the attached foulants, resulting in a reduction of membrane resistance, thus creating higher permeability of the membrane.",n
"The partial elements of membrane resistance, including intrinsic (Rm), adsorptive (Ra), deposition (Rd), and concentration polarization (Rcp) resistances in the dark and under UV light conditions of filtration were assessed, and the results are depicted in Fig. 16(b). The neat PSf and PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 demonstrated the maximum and minimum membrane resistance in all conditions, respectively. In membrane filtration, lower resistance is more desirable in order to generate a higher permeate flux rate. When PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane was exposed to UV light irradiation, the resistance was reduced by about 52.43 % compared to the same membrane in the dark filtration condition. Moreover, the resistance reduction occurred in all constituting elements of resistance, suggesting that the photocatalytic properties of the membrane play an important role in preventing the formation of fouling on the membrane.",n
"Fig. 16(c) depicts the total fouling ratio (RT), reversible fouling ratio (RR), irreversible fouling ratio (RIr), and permeate flux recovery ratio (FRR) of the membranes in the dark and under UV light exposure. The modified membranes exhibited lower fouling ratios compared to the corresponding value of the neat PSf membrane. Furthermore, the FRR of all modified membranes irradiated with UV light was higher than that of the neat PSf membrane, suggesting the improved antifouling activities of the modified membranes due to the photocatalytic process by degrading concentrated pollutants on the membrane's surface to prevent the fouling formation. However, no significant improvement regarding the antifouling properties of the neat PSf membrane (MM-01) was observed when it was irradiated with UV light. It is due to the fact that the neat PSf is not classified as a photocatalytic material. The values of RR and RIr of the modified membranes were lower than that of neat PSf. As an example, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 (MM-04) has the RT value of 34.27 % in the dark condition, which consists of 44.15 % of RR and 55.85 % of RIr. Once it was irradiated with UV light, the total fouling ratio reduced to 21.26 % which 73.52 % is relevant to RR and 26.48 % is relevant to RIr. The declined RT value indicates that the modified membrane is more capable of preventing fouling occurrence [72]. Moreover, the reduction of irreversible fouling proportion when the membrane was exposed to UV light suggests that the pore blocking in the membrane by the pollutant molecules can be reduced due to the photocatalytic degradation effect of the ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 composite on the membrane's surface. In comparison with irreversible fouling, the reversible fouling on the membrane is repairable and easier to treat by a simple method such as conventional rinsing [42]. Therefore, performing the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane under UV light irradiation significantly improved the antifouling properties to prevent fouling formation and prolong the usability of the membrane.",n
"The basic properties and key findings of the prepared PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 irradiated under UV light that tested in the photocatalytic membrane filtration system are compared with other similar studies in the literature as summarized in Table 7. As comprised in Table 7, relative to other photocatalytic composite membranes, PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane shows comparable improvements in permeability, pollutant removal, flux stability, photocatalytic ability, and antifouling properties. Synergetic outstanding surface characteristics such as roughness, wettability, and porosity with photocatalytic activity from of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite resulted in those significant improvements. The utilization of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst composite in PSf for treating the highly polluted NRW was not the case in other reported studies in the literature. In conclusion, this present study can provide new insight into treating the contaminated water using integrated filtration and photocatalysis in a single membrane composite.",n
"This present study investigates the effects of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst addition in the polysulfone (PSf) membrane that performed a combined membrane filtration and photocatalytic process under UV light irradiation for natural rubber-laden wastewater (NRW) treatment. The photocatalyst composites were synthesized using the sol-gel method, and the membranes were prepared using the phase inversion technique. SEM and EDX mapping results show that the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane exhibited a smooth surface with a well-constructed finger-like structure and a pretty uniform dispersion of photocatalysts elementals on its surface. AFM results support the finding that the addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst resulted in a rougher surface image that increased the contact area, thus, boosting the membrane's permeability. Several new polar functional groups such as Zn-O, Mn-O, and Si-O-Si were confirmed in the FTIR spectrum of PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. DRS results showed that the MnO2 doping in ZnO successfully improved the photo-sensitivity and photocatalytic activity of the composite, suggesting the reduction of the bandgap energy from 3.10 eV to 2.65 eV, which promoted the photocatalytic improvement. The addition of ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 photocatalyst also improved the membrane porosity, hydrophilicity, water uptake ability, and mechanical strength. Furthermore, the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane also exhibited enhanced performance on permeate flux, pollutant rejection, and photo-degradation ability. Reactive species (h+, 0O2-, 0OH) contributed as the photo-degradation agents. The photocatalytic kinetic evaluation suggested that the pollutant degradation behavior showed a better fit using the pseudo-first order kinetic model rather than the zero-order model, with the highest photocatalytic degradation rate achieved by PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane. Performing the PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane under UV light irradiation significantly improved the flux stability, membrane recyclability, and antifouling properties to prevent the fouling formation and prolong the usability of the membrane. In conclusion, according to all characteristics and performance, PSf/ZnO-MnO2@SiO2 membrane is found to be the most promising UV light-driven photocatalytic membrane for effective NRW treatment.",n

"The wastewater produced by manufacturing is harmful for environment and wild and human health [1,2]. Pulp and paper industry is one of the most polluting industry in the world, consuming more than 900 million m3 of fresh water and disposing around 700 million m3 of wastewater per year [3]. During the production of paper in a thermomechanical pulp mill, a process water (ThMP), mainly consisting of hemicellulose and lignin, is leaving the mill to be treated at a wastewater treatment plant [4]. However, hemicellulose is considered a valuable polymeric compound, and if recovered from the process water it can be used for other purposes. There are many potential application areas for hemicellulose, such as oxygen barrier films, food coatings, hydrogels or biomedical applications [5,6]. For these applications, it is desired to purify the hemicellulose from lignin and low molecular weight compounds such as extractives and salts. Membrane filtration has previously been selected as a promising pretreatment method of this feed solution [4,7]. However, the separation of hemicellulose using membranes is challenging due to membrane fouling related issues [8-10]. Membrane fouling results in a significant decrease in total flux, along with the possibility of a complete loss of operational properties. Therefore, it is of high interest to produce and evaluate membranes with antifouling properties for the filtration of ThMP process water, to contribute to the development and implementation of membrane filtration processes in large-scale industries.",n
"Membrane hydrophilization is one of the widely used techniques for fouling mitigating. It can be carried out by coating [13] and grafting [14] as well as using hydrophilic polymers [15], co-polymers [16], oligomers [17] and nanoparticles [18] via blending technique. Both coating and grafting techniques require additional modification steps [19,20], that complicates the industrial production of membranes. Membranes modified via blending, e.g., by hydrophilic polymers [21], are often characterized by the washing out of the hydrophilization agent due to their affinity to water during the phase separation and further operation and are not effective for surface hydrophilization.",n
"Surface modification is an efficient method for membrane modification due to the location of the modification agent on the selective layer surface as well as on the pore walls of the selective layer and the possibility of agent to directly contact with the feed solution, resulting in more efficient separation and enhanced antifouling performance. Antifouling membrane performance could be improved by reducing the surface roughness, hydrophilization of the membrane surface and changing the surface charge [11,12].",n
"Polyelectrolytes are promising for membrane modification for improving membrane antifouling stability due to the presence of the hydrophilic and charged groups. When polyelectrolyte macromolecules are included in the membrane structure, they feasibly form a hydrated layer on the membrane surface and prevent fouling. Moreover, their ability to change the conformation, when external conditions are varied, makes it possible to impart surface self-cleaning properties to membranes. Membrane modification using polyelectrolyte solutions is often carried out by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique [22,23]. Polyethylenimine (PEI) [24], polyacrylic acid (PAA) [25], poly(allyl amine) hydrochloride [26], poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) [27], poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) [28] are often used for preparation of the selective layer of composite membranes for microfiltration [31], ultrafiltration [29], nanofiltration [30], or reverse osmosis [32] via LbL technique.",n
"Membrane modification via the addition of the polyelectrolytes and hydrophilic polymers into the coagulant in non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) has shown to be a highly effective one-step method which requires no additional procedures [33-39]. It was reported that polyelectrolyte macromolecules added to the coagulation bath migrate to the surface of the nascent polymer membrane during non-solvent induced phase separation. Studies of the composition of the membrane selective layer revealed that polyelectrolyte macromolecules are mainly immobilized on the surface of the membrane selective layer as well as on the pore walls, but not on the surface of the bottom layer. This facilitates the formation of the thin layer of water molecules due to hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic groups of polyelectrolyte macromolecules immobilized on the selective layer surface which prevents the adsorption of the dissolved compounds during filtration. Thus, introduction of polyelectrolytes to the coagulation bath was found to be a facile, easy to carry out, cheap and effective method for reducing the membrane fouling [34-37].",n
"Liu et al. [33] suggested an one-step membrane preparation technique based on the modification of activated carboxylated poly(arylene ether ketone)s (PAEK-COOH) flat sheet membrane by crosslinking with PEI in the coagulation bath during the phase separation process. It was found that the membrane flux of the initial PAEK-COOH membrane was more than two times lower compared to the PEI modified membrane. Moreover, the water contact angle of the modified membrane selective layer was revealed to be 43deg, which was 20deg lower compared to the reference membrane. This is due to the immobilization of the hydrophilic PEI units on the membrane selective layer surface [33].",n
"Plisko et al. [34,35] and Hliavitskaya et al. [36,37] reported the modification of the polysulfone (PSf) and polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membranes, correspondingly, by addition of the cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes (commercially available flocculants) based on polyacrylamide containing poly(2-(acryloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium chloride) blocks (Praestol 859) [34,37] and poly(sodium acrylate) blocks (Praestol 2540) [35,36], in the coagulation bath during NIPS. It was found that polyelectrolyte macromolecules predominately immobilize on the surface of the selective layer and not on the bottom layer. It was shown that PSf membrane modifications by Praestol 859 and Praestol 2540 result in surface hydrophilization, surface roughness increase and greater negative zeta potential values at pH 7-10 compared to the reference membrane, as well as improvement of membrane antifouling stability in the ultrafiltration of human serum albumin solution, model humic acid solution and surface water ultrafiltration [34,35]. It was revealed that modifications of PES membranes with cationic and anionic flocculants Praestol led to decrease in water contact angle of the selective layer, increase in surface roughness and increase in membrane antifouling resistance in bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution [37] and during ThMP ultrafiltration [36,37]. Moreover, it was shown that PES membrane modifications by Praestol 859 and Praestol 2540 led to 2-7 [37] and 3-8 [36] times increase in flux, increase in fouling recovery ratio by 2 times and improvement of cleaning efficiency without decreasing membrane rejection with regard to hemicelluloses and lignin as reference components in ThMP ultrafiltration [36,37].",n
"He et al. [38] described an approach to obtain the antifouling layer on the membrane surface by a reaction enhanced surface segregation method. This technique included the addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in the casting solution as a surface segregation agent and PAA as an additive in the coagulation bath. It was shown that application of PAA as an additive in the coagulation bath led to the significant surface hydrophilization, enhancing the negative surface charge and, besides, increasing flux recovery ratio values after oil-water emulsion and bovine serum albumin solution filtration [38].",n
"In this article, a further development of the method of PSf ultrafiltration membrane modification by addition of polyelectrolytes into the coagulation bath via NIPS was performed [34-37].

The novelty of this work is that the modification of PSf membranes using the addition of PAA to the coagulation bath is systematically studied for the first time.

To study the composition of the selective layer and bottom layer of the membranes modified by the PAA addition to the coagulation bath Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using frustrated total internal reflection method was applied. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Is50 IR Fourier spectrometer (Thermo Scientific(tm)) in the frequency range of 400-4000 cm-1 with an accuracy of 0.01 cm-1. The membrane samples were dried for five days before the FTIR studies.,n

"First, membranes were compacted for 30 min at 1 bar while pure water ultrafiltration with stirring. Directly after this, the membrane PWF was measured every 5 min until it became constant. This value was considered as membrane PWF. Thereafter, the water was replaced by either 0.3 wt% aqueous solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K-30) or 0.5 wt% Lys solution in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Flux (J, L m-2 h-1) and rejection coefficient (R, %) of the reference PSf and modified membranes were measured after 30 min of ultrafiltration at 1 bar and ambient temperature. The Lys contents were analyzed with an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Metertech UV-VIS SP 8001) at a wavelength of 280 nm. The concentration of PVP K-30 was evaluated using a Rayleigh interferometer.

"The membrane pH-sensitivity (dependence of pure water flux on the pH) was investigated by filtration of MilliQ water adjusted to different pH values (3, 5, 7, 9) using 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions. The procedure was the following: first, the studied membrane was pre-conditioned for 30 min while pure water ultrafiltration at 1 bar. Then, MilliQ water with pH 3 was placed into the filtration cell. The ultrafiltration was carried out for 30 min and flux was measured. Thereafter, MilliQ water with pH 5 was filled into the ultrafiltration cell and filtered for 30 min. The pure water flux was measured. The similar procedure was repeated for pH 7 and 9. Thereafter, MilliQ water was filtered during 30 min and the cycle started again. Overall, three filtration cycles were carried out to study reproducibility of the change of flux in response to the pH change.",n

While filtration of 5*10-3 wt% HAs solution in tap water for 1 h, flux (JHAs, L m-2 h-1) and rejection coefficients were determined every 10 min. After that the membranes were cleaned with MilliQ water during 30 min of ultrafiltration and the PWF was determined.

"The UF experimental setup used for the filtration of ThMP process water included a 15 L feed tank with temperature regulation by a temperature control unit (Model MCM, Shinko, Technos Co., Ltd, Japan) and an immersion heater (Baker, Elektro-Varme, Sweden) (Fig. S2, Supporting information). The overall transmembrane pressure (TMP) was monitored by two digital pressure gauges (DCS40.0AR, Trafag AG, Switzerland) on the feed and retentate sides, and controlled using a needle valve on the retentate side. The crossflow velocity (CFV) over the membrane surface was measured by a flowmeter (FCH-34-PP-Chemica, B.I.O-TECH E.K., Germany) placed on the retentate side and the flow was set by a positive displacement pump (Hydra-cell D25XL, Wanner, USA). The setup was equipped with 3 identical and parallel membrane modules. Each module had a circular shape and an effective membrane area of 19.6 cm2. Scales (PL6001-1, Mettler Toledo Inc., USA) placed below each of the modules were used to calculate the permeate fluxes based on mass differences over time.

"The following analytical procedure was performed as per the standardized NREL procedure [41,42].",n
"The concentration of hemicelluloses was determined using mannan as an indicator sugar for the softwood hemicellulose. To obtain monomeric forms of sugars from polysaccharides for analysis, an acid hydrolysis of 20 mL samples with 1.5 mL of 72% sulfuric acid was performed in an autoclave (Systec DX-150, Germany) at 121 degC for 1 h. The hydrolysates were thereafter filtrated through ceramic filters to separate soluble parts from acid insoluble solids. Further, the filtrates collected from this filtration step were diluted in deionized water before being analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography with a Dionex ICS-3000 (Dionex Corp., USA) system. The system was equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector and a Carbo Pac PA1 as analytical column. Deionized water at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1 was used as eluent solution, while a 200 mM NaOH solution at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min-1 was considered for post column eluent addition.

To reach the temperature of 250 degC, temperature increase rate of 10 degC min-1 was considered while for the following temperature increase, 20 degC min-1 temperature ramping was performed. The ash content was the difference in weight prior and after the ashing procedure.",n

FTIR spectra of the selective layers and the bottom layers of both the reference PSf membrane and PSf membranes modified via the addition of PAA to the coagulation bath are presented in Fig. 1. It was found that vibrations of PSf membrane matrix prevail both in the spectra of reference and modified membranes.,n
"It was revealed that the absorption bands with the peak at 1153 cm-1 are due to the PSf R-SO2-R group symmetric stretching vibrations (Fig. 1). The absorption bands at 1583, 1487 and 1106 cm-1 belong to the vibrations of PSf aromatic ring (CC bonds) [44]. Peak at 1243 cm-1 is assigned to the vibrations of -C-O-C- groups bound with benzene ring of PSf [45]. Stretching fluctuations of S-N groups are observed at 2850 and 2965 cm-1. The absorption bands at 1650 cm-1 correspond to the vibrations of the S=O in carboxylic groups of PAA immobilized on the selective layer surface (2-6 in Fig. 1) [46]. FTIR spectra of the selective layer of modified membranes were characterized by the wide absorption band in the range of 3000-3600 cm-1, peaking at 3420 cm-1. These broad peaks correspond to the vibrations of the O-H groups involved in the formation of hydrogen bound of the carboxylic groups immobilized on the surface of the selective layer (2-6 in Fig. 1). This was the result of the immobilization of the polyelectrolyte macromolecules into the PSf membrane selective layer when PAA is added in the coagulation bath upon membrane preparation by NIPS. It was found that an increase in PAA concentration in the coagulation bath yields the increase in the intensity of the peaks at 1650 and 3420 cm-1 in the spectra of the selective layer surface (2-6 in Fig. 1). This is due to the fact that more PAA macromolecules were immobilized on the surface of membrane selective layer. However, no evidence of immobilization of PAA macromolecules was revealed on the surface of the membrane bottom layer (7 in Fig. 1). This finding is in agreement with the results obtained in our previous works [34,35]. This fact can be explained in the following way: polymer film was cast on the glass plate and then immersed in the coagulation bath, so membrane bottom layer is blocked by the glass plate from the contact with coagulant until the membrane will be completely formed and spontaneously released from the glass plate. In this system the selective layer is the first to contact with the coagulant during membrane formation via NIPS. The diffusion of the coagulant occurs in the direction from the selective layer to the bottom layer across the nascent polymer film. Absence of PAA macromolecules on the surface of the membrane bottom layer is due to the low rate of their diffusion through the formed less porous and dense selective layer across the nascent polymer film during membrane preparation via NIPS [34,35].",n
"The effect of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath on the membrane structure is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The structure of the reference PSf membrane as well as the membranes modified by PAA consists of the thin selective layer, the transitional layer and porous membrane matrix pierced by elongated macrovoids. The reference PSf membrane was revealed to feature the porous transitional layer located near the selective layer and porous membrane matrix between large macrovoids (Fig. 2a). This morphology is a common structure formed by instantaneous demixing mechanism in NIPS. Addition of 0.4 wt% of PAA results in the change of the macrovoid shape: they become wider, shorter, some of the macrovoids become oval. The thickness of the transitional layer increased (macrovoids move farther from the selective layer); however, it remained very porous (Fig. 2b). It was found that starting from 0.7 wt% PAA in the coagulation bath and further increase in the PAA concentration the number of macrovoids decreases and a denser selective layer and less porous membrane matrix are formed (Fig. 2c-f). Moreover, the thickness of the transitional and selective layers increased with the rise of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath. It was previously found that the addition of the cationic or anionic polyelectrolytes (commercially available flocculants) based on polyacrylamide, Praestol 859 or Praestol 2540, respectively, to the coagulation bath does not influence the thermodynamics of the phase separation of the casting solution [34-37]. It was established that the key factor responsible for the change of membrane structure is a significant rise in viscosity of the coagulation bath. ""Solvent-non-solvent"" exchange rate during membrane preparation via NIPS decreased with the increase in coagulant viscosity. In other words, the in-diffusion velocity of the precipitant into the cast polymer film and out-diffusion velocity of the solvent out of the polymer film decreased [34-37]. Previously, it has been revealed that the addition of polyelectrolytes to the coagulation bath yields the increase in membrane formation time due to the increase in the coagulant viscosity [34-37].",n
"In this study it was found that addition of PAA to the coagulant also leads to the increase of viscosity (Fig. S3 A, Supporting information). However, this increase in viscosity is rather small compared to the addition of Praestol flocculants based on polyacrylamide [34-37]. For instance, when 2.0 wt% of PAA is added to coagulant the viscosity increases by 2.2 times compared to water (Fig. S3 A, Supporting information). The systematic dependence of membrane formation time on coagulant viscosity was revealed and presented on Fig. S3 B (Supporting information). When 1.0 wt% of PAA is added to the coagulation bath membrane formation time increases by 1.7 times (from 7 up to 12 s); and when 2.0 wt% of PAA is added - by 2.9 times (from 7 up to 20 s) compared to membrane formation time when water is used as a coagulant. So, it was revealed that PAA addition to coagulation bath leads to the slight increase of membrane formation time due to not very high molecular weight. It should be taken into account that membrane formation time as determined in this study is a global measure of kinetic processes during NIPS and will not reflect all mechanistic details; what happens at the interface upon contact between cast film and coagulant is certainly not fully covered. A possible reason of structural changes of membrane cross-section is the immobilization of PAA macromolecules in the membrane selective layer, which leads to the formation of thicker and denser selective membrane layer. Upon the contact with the coagulant a partly precipitated gel-like selective layer is formed and further diffusion of the coagulant happens through this formed layer. The diffusion coefficient of PAA macromolecules through the formed selective layer is lower compared to the diffusion coefficient of solvent and non-solvent. Hence, it is expected that the depth of PAA anchorage in polymer matrix will be in the vicinity of the selective layer and concentration of PAA will significantly decrease across the membrane thickness. The evidence for this is the absence of PAA macromolecules on the surface of the membrane bottom layer which was confirmed by FTIR and discussed above.",n
"It was revealed that PAA addition led to a decrease in a number of pores in the membrane selective layer and a decrease in the pore size (Fig. 3). This is due to the deceleration of phase inversion rate, caused by the coagulation bath viscosity increase. Pores of the selective layer of PA-2.0 membrane become so small that they can no longer be detected by SEM at the magnification used (Fig. 3e).",n
"The topology of the surface of membrane selective layer was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is known that surface roughness of the selective layer has a great impact on antifouling membrane stability [47]. The surface roughness of the membrane selective layer was analyzed for the reference membrane (PA-0) and membranes with high PAA concentration in the coagulation bath (PA-1.0, PA-1.5 and PA-2.0) (Fig. S4, Supporting information).",n
"It was found that the selective layers of modified membranes have a nodular structure typical of membranes obtained via NIPS. Further, it was shown that immobilization of the PAA macromolecules on the selective layer surface had only a weak influence on the topology and selective layer roughness (Table 4). However, it was revealed to be the minimum values of the roughness parameters, both average roughness (Ra, nm) and root mean square roughness (Rq, nm), for PA-1.5 membranes. According to this, the PA-1.5 membranes are characterized by a smoother selective layer surface.",n
"Zeta potentials of the selective layer surface of the reference and modified membranes were investigated via measurements of the tangential flow streaming potential. It is known that zeta potential greatly affects membrane separation performance as well as antifouling resistance. It was revealed that the zeta potential was negative for reference and modified membranes over the entire investigated pH range. Zero fit showed that the isoelectric point for PA-0 membranes was approximately at pH 3.4, for PA-1.0 membranes it was at pH 3.3, for PA-1.5 and PA-2.0 - at pH 2.5 (Fig. 4). Hence, the isoelectric point was found to decrease with PAA concentration in the coagulation bath. Decrease in the zeta potential of the selective layer surface of the reference membrane with pH rise are explained by the specific adsorption of anions of electrolyte (Cl-) and hydroxyl ions (OH-) whereas PSf has no dissociated (negatively charged) groups [48]. It was found that the zeta potential of the reference membrane is lower in absolute value than that of the membranes modified by PAA over the whole pH range. An increase in the PAA content in coagulation bath and, therefore, a density of immobilized macromolecules (Fig. 1) yielded the decrease in zeta potential of the membrane surface (Fig. 4). It was shown that zeta potential decreased when pH increased, that is due to the ionization of PAA macromolecules (pKa of the PAA is 4.5 [49]). These results are consistent with the data obtained in [35].",n
"A water contact angle characterizes the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface and impacts the antifouling membrane performance [34]. It was found that addition of 0.4 wt% of PAA into the coagulation bath during membrane preparation results in a dramatic decrease in water contact angle from 65deg for the reference PA-0 membrane down to 25deg. Further, increase of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath yielded the decrease in water contact angle down to 20-21deg for PA-0.7, PA-1.0 and PA-1.2 membranes. The rise of PAA concentration in the coagulation bath up to 1.5 and 2.0 wt% led to further hydrophilization of the surface of the membrane selective layer: the water contact angle became 17-16deg (Fig. 5). This is due to the increase in the density of immobilized polyelectrolyte macromolecules containing hydrophilic groups which was confirmed by FTIR analysis (Fig. 1). Carboxylic groups (-COOH) of PAA were solvated by the water molecules forming the hydration layer which prevents the absorption of proteins and colloid particles on the membrane surface [38].",n
"Membrane separation performance depends primarily on the selective layer structure (thickness, pore size and porosity). The membrane pure water flux (PWF) was found to decrease with an increasing the PAA concentration in the coagulation bath (Fig. 6A). For instance, PWF for PA-2.0 decreased by 2.2 times compared to the reference PA-0 membrane. This is the result of the formation of a denser selective layer and a decreasing of the selective layer pore size and porosity, which was confirmed by SEM (Fig. 3).",n
"The PVP K-30 rejection coefficient, on the contrary, was shown to increase up to more than 99% with the increasing of polyelectrolyte concentration in the coagulation bath, compared to 90% for the reference membrane (Fig. 6A). Decreasing of the pore size leads to the reduction of permeability of the PVP macromolecules and, therefore, to the increase in rejection coefficient.",n
"Membrane separation performance was also investigated by filtration of the 0.5 wt% lysozyme solution in the phosphate buffer with pH 7.2. It was found that the addition of 0.4 wt% PAA into the coagulation bath resulted in a lysozyme solution flux decrease in 2.6-2.8 times (Fig. 6B). However, further increase in PAA concentration did not affect the modified membrane flux, and it did not exceed 13-15 L m-2 h-1. The lysozyme rejection coefficient increased up to 99% for PA-2.0 membrane. This was the result of decreasing the pore size of the membrane selective layer (Fig. 3). Another possible reason is the higher adsorption of positively charged lysozyme macromolecules at pH 7.2 on the negatively charged membrane selective layer surface. The latter factor could promote the electrostatic attraction of lysozyme macromolecules to the membrane surface and facilitate the formation of a gel layer of lysozyme, which served as a secondary membrane and increased lysozyme rejection during ultrafiltration (Figs. 4 and 6B).",n
It was found that pH of the feed solution affects the modified membrane performance due to the presence of PAA macromolecules on the selective layer surface and on the pore walls. It is known that the ion strength and pH variations cause the self-induced reversible conformation transition of the polyelectrolyte macromolecules: a stretched chain -- a globule. The degree of elongation of the polyelectrolyte chain coil increases proportionally to the degree of ionization due to the electrostatic repulsion of charged groups. Polymer chains in the stretched conformation probably covered a large membrane surface area thereby decreasing the effective pore size that resulted in a flux reduction.,n
"The dependence of flux changes on the pH of the feed water was studied for PA-1.5 membrane (Fig. 7). Polyelectrolyte units immobilized on the selective layer surface and inside the pores, being protonated at pH 3, assumed the globule conformation and therefore did not block the pores. Consequently, the membrane flux was found to be the highest at pH 3. Further proceeding to the base pH region induced the ionization of the carboxylic groups of the PAA with the formation of the negatively charged carboxylate groups. Repulsion of similar charged groups caused the transition of PAA macromolecules to the stretched conformation and partially blocked the membrane pores. Thereby, the membrane flux was decreased by 4 times, in the average, at pH 7 and 9 compared to the flux at pH 3.",n
"The reproducibility of results was demonstrated over three filtration cycles (Fig. 7). It was found that pH-sensitivity was maintained over the three filtration cycles. The increasing membrane flux in the second and third cycles was probably due to the washing out of PEG-400 from the membrane selective layer and pores. However, the pH-sensitivity of membranes was not lost. Thus, it can be stated that PAA macromolecules were strongly fixed in the PSf membrane matrix.",n
"The influence of PAA addition to the coagulation bath on the antifouling performance was investigated during filtration of the 5*10-3 wt% humic acids (HAs) solution in tap water. The antifouling performance of the reference PA-0 and modified PA-1.5 membranes was studied. HAs performance and antifouling parameters (flux recovery ratio (FRR) and total flux decline ratio (DT)) as well as permeate characteristics are presented in Table 5. It was found that HAs flux of the reference membrane PA-0 decreased from 120 to 102 L m-2 h-1 after 1 h of HAs solution ultrafiltration, however for the PA-1.5 membrane flux was constant during 1 h of filtration -- 68 L m-2 h-1. Pure water flux of the PA-0 membrane after filtration of the HAs solution decreased down to 87 L m-2 h-1, while water flux of the PA-1.5 membrane was the same as HAs solution flux. According to this, the PA-1.5 membrane was found to feature significantly higher antifouling stability than the reference one. Better antifouling stability of PA-1.5 membrane compared to the reference one was attributed to the smaller pore size of the selective layer of the PA-1.5 membrane compared to the reference PA-0 membrane (Fig. 3a, d); lower surface roughness (Table 4, Fig. S4, Supporting information) and significantly higher hydrophilicity (Fig. 5). Moreover, HAs molecules feature negative charge at pH 8.4 [51]. It was shown that selective layer surface of the PA-1.5 membrane is characterized by higher absolute value of negative charge compared to the reference membrane (Fig. 4). This results in the better repulsion of HAs molecules and PA-1.5 membrane selective layer.",n
"Based on the permeate characteristics after filtration of HAs solutions, it was shown that both PA-0 and PA-1.5 membranes were effective in surface water treatment, which usually contains HAs and fulvic acids (Table 5). However, it was found that the PA-1.5 membrane is characterized by higher iron removal from HAs solutions compared to the reference membrane, due to the electrostatic adsorption of positively charged iron ions on the surface of membrane selective layer of the PA-1.5 membrane with higher absolute value of negative charge compared to the PA-0 membrane at pH 8.4 (Fig. 4, Table 5).",n
"Fig. 8 presents the fluxes during the filtration of ThMP process water and the permeances of the PSf membranes. It was revealed that PAA addition to the coagulation bath during the membrane formation led to an increase in the negative value of zeta potential and hydrophilicity of the membrane surface (Figs. 4 and 5) and a decrease in the pore size and porosity (Fig. 3) of the selective layer, which led to the reduction in the attachment of fouling substances.",n
"The dependence of membrane flux during ultrafiltration of ThMP process water on transmembrane pressure (TMP) is shown in Fig. 8A. It was found that membrane flux increased with increasing the PAA concentration in the coagulation bath; only after using high PAA concentration about the same flux was obtained (PA-1.0 vs. PA-1.5). The enhanced fluxes can be related to an increase in antifouling resistance of modified membranes due to the substantial increase in selective layer hydrophilicity and negative charge that prevent the formation of the gel layer of dissolved substance on the membrane surface and the loss of permeability. In contrast, the reduction in PWF for the membranes with higher PAA content in the coagulation bath is due to the decrease in the pore size and porosity of the selective layer and increase in the thickness of the selective layer (Figs. 2, 3, 6). Thus, membrane morphology (especially pore size, porosity and selective layer thickness) is more influential on PWF than hydrophilicity, as reported in [50].",n
"Membrane permeances using pure water were studied before ThMP process water ultrafiltration, after rinsing with deionized water and cleaning with an alkaline agent after ThMP process water ultrafiltration (Fig. 8B). It was found that initial permeance of the modified membranes is lower than the permeance of the reference membrane. This is due to the decrease in pore size and porosity of the membrane selective layer and increase in selective layer thickness (Figs. 2, 3). However, permeances of modified membranes after rinsing were revealed to be higher compared to the PA-0 membrane. Moreover, it was found to be 2 times higher for the PA-1.0 membrane compared to the reference one (Fig. 8B). Permeance was found to increase by 2 times after membrane cleaning with the alkaline agent Ultrasil 10 both for reference and modified membranes compared to the permeance after rinsing with pure water. Nevertheless, membrane permeance after rinsing and cleaning did not exceed the initial permeance value, which indicates irreversible membrane fouling.",n
"Considering the results shown in Fig. 9, the flux recovery ratios suggest less irreversible interactions between fouling compounds in the feed solution and the membrane surface, especially for the membranes with high PAA concentration (PA-1.0 and PA-1.5). This could indicate that the enhanced hydrophilicity and more negative surface zeta potential of these membranes (PA-1.0 and PA-1.5) did not only improve the filtration fluxes of ThMP process water but also reduced the membrane-foulant interactions. In comparison to the reference membrane, increasing the concentration of PAA also resulted in an increase in the FRRs. Thus, PAA is efficient in reducing fouling accumulation on the membrane surface as most of the membranes with PAA are characterized by higher FRR compared to the reference membrane.",n
"According to rejection results (Fig. 10), an increase in PAA concentration in the coagulation bath during membrane formation had practically no impact on the rejection of lignin, however, the rejection of hemicellulose slightly increased. The results of total lignin rejection for the modified membranes (Fig. 10A) were between 26.5% and 31.5%. The reference membrane, without PAA addition in the coagulation bath retained about 25.9% of total lignin.",n
"The developed membranes were found to be more effective for the concentration of hemicellulose due to the smaller pore size of the selective layer compared to the reference PA-0 membrane (Fig. 10B). While the PA-0 membrane retained 91.3%, the membranes modified with PAA retained between 96.1% and 96.7%. The difference in retentions between hemicellulose and lignin also suggest the possibility to purify hemicellulose if these membranes are used for ThMP process water treatment in the pulp industry.",n
"A novel approach of preparation of PSf membranes with enhanced antifouling stability by addition of PAA to the coagulation bath via NIPS was developed. The effect of the polyelectrolyte concentration in the coagulation bath on the membrane surface characteristics (water contact angle, zeta potential, surface roughness), pore structure and separation performance was studied.",n
"According to SEM studies, addition of polyelectrolyte into the coagulation bath led to decrease in the number of macrovoids and formation of a denser selective layer as well as decreasing the pore size and porosity of the selective layer. This is caused by the increase in the coagulation bath viscosity with added PAA and results in the membrane PWF and lysozyme flux decrease and PVP K-30 and lysozyme rejection coefficients increase.",n
It was shown that membrane surface becomes more negatively charged with PAA concentration increase due to the immobilization of PAA macromolecules on the surface of the membrane selective layer and inside the pores. Introduction of the PAA units into the membrane structure was found to enhance the membrane surface hydrophilicity. Modified membranes are characterized by the reversible pH-sensitivity; the PA-1.5 membrane was revealed to have flux at pH 3 four times higher than at pH 7 and 9.,n
"Modified membranes demonstrated better antifouling stability during HAs solution filtration compared to the reference membrane. For filtration of ThMP process water, the PA-1.0 and PA-1.5 membranes showed positive results both in terms of higher flux and FRR in comparison with the reference membrane and other modified membranes, without affecting the rejection of lignin and improving the retention of hemicellulose. The rejection coefficients of hemicelluloses of modified membranes increased compared to the reference membrane, which provides the possibility for the application of the developed membranes for the valorization of hemicelluloses from the ThMP process water in pulp industry.",n

"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common public health issues around the world due to its high morbidity, and millions of the patients die every year for lack of cost-efficient treatment [1]. Organ transplantation shows the best therapeutic effect so far and is used for CKD treatments especially in terminal stage. However, the high cost of organ transplantation is unaffordable for most CKD patients. The lack of donors and difficulty in organ matching also restrict the availability of organ transplantation. As a blood purification technology, hemodialysis has served as an alternative therapy for CKD since 1950s. Hemodialysis consists of a hemodialysis membrane-based dialyzer and a circulatory blood purification system, which together purify the blood coming from CKD patients and then circulate it back [2]. Hemodialysis is widely used among the dialysis and blood purification techniques because of relatively low cost and low treatment requirements. Moreover, as it is an extracorporeal process, side reactions seldom occur [3].",n
"Hemodialysis membranes are the core unit in hemodialysis. They are porous membrane allowing the passage of water molecules and small solutes while rejecting macromolecules with certain molecular weights. A few artificial and synthetic polymers such as cellulose acetate (CA) [4,5], poly(lactic acid) (PLA) [6-8], polyethersulfone (PES) [1,9], polysulfone (PSF) [10-15], and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) [16], have been used to prepare hemodialysis membranes. Among these polymers, PSF is distinguished because of its excellent mechanical property, chemical durability, and processibility. Also importantly, PSF is one of the few biomaterials that can remain stable in all sterilization conditions (steam, ethylene oxide, and gamma radiation, etc.) [11]. Besides, PSF-based membranes show superior clearance rate to uremic toxins [17] and have become a prime choice for clinicians administering dialysis. However, the relatively hydrophobic nature of PSF tends to cause adsorption of proteins during the hemodialysis process, which can further lead to serious even life-threatening complications due to activation of the complement alternative pathway [18]. Protein deposition on the membranes during dialysis also deteriorates the permeability and rejection performances of membranes. In addition, the hydrophobicity of PSF usually results in relatively poor hemocompatibility, so anticoagulants are always employed during treatments in order to avoid clot formation [19,20].",n
"Because of these issues, modification to PSF is usually prerequisite before it can be used in hemodialysis. To this end, different modification methods have been utilized. For instance, researchers have tried some surface modification techniques such as air-plasma glow discharge treatment on the pristine PSF membranes to improve their biocompatibility [11,21]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and heparin (Hep) were also grafted onto PSF membranes by plasma-induced surface modification to prepare PSF-PEG-Hep membranes [12]. However, constrained to the complexity of these modification methods, it is difficult to industrialize and apply to medical services. At the current stage, blending outstanding-biocompatibility additives with PSF to improve the biocompatibility of PSF-based membranes is the main method to prepare commercial hemodialysis membranes. PSF membranes blended with hydrophilic additives, including silibinin (SLB) [22], PSF-g-TPGS [13], and others [23,24], exhibited enhanced biocompatibility. Meanwhile, the additives can act as porogon. Although the hemodialysis performances of PSF-based membranes can be improved to some extent, the shear force between the circulating fluid and the hemodialysis membrane can lead to the wash-out of additives from the membrane surface during dialysis process, thus affecting the biocompatibility of the dialysis membrane [9,25]. Moreover, the types of hemodialysis membranes, sterilization method, storage period and preflush method can also cause the elution of additives [26-28]. Therefore, it is urgent to find a more effective and safe method to prepare PSF-based hemodialysis membranes.",n
"In our previous work, we combined PEG blocks with PSF by copolymerization to enhance hydrophilicity, and thus produced PSF-b-PEG block copolymer was used to prepare ultrafiltration membranes by NIPS [29]. The prepared membranes showed upgraded surface hydrophilicity and consequently high permeability as well as good fouling resistance. To be noted, the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the prepared PSF-b-PEG membranes is around 42 kDa, where small/medium sized molecular toxins and macromolecular proteins can be separated. Meanwhile, as a hydrophilic and non-toxic polymer with high mobility and antifouling property to plasma proteins or platelets, PEG can improve the hemocompatibility and biocompatibility of PSF. Therefore, the hemodialysis performances of the PSF-b-PEG membranes are expected. In this study, we attempt to formulate dialysis-grade PSF-b-PEG membranes by NIPS without any additives or post-treatments. The morphology, permeance, solute rejection, hydrophilicity, protein adsorption, hemocompatibility and toxin clearance of the PSF-b-PEG membranes will be investigated.",n
"PSF-b-PEG block copolymers were obtained from Nanjing Bangding. The polydispersive index (PDI) was ~2.00, and the PEG block had a molecular weight of ~20 kDa, as provided by the manufacturer. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the PEG content was 21 wt%. PSF (average molecular weight 22000 Da) were obtained from Solvay. PEG and urea (AR) were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Bio.-Chem. Technology Co., LTD. Calcium chloride anhydrous (CaCl2, AR) and sodium chloride (NaCl, AR) were purchased from Xilong Scientific, LDC. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, >= 99.0%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., LTD. Lysozyme from egg white (LZM, 40000 U/mg) and p-Diaminobenzaldehyde (PDAB, AR) were obtained from Macklin. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, purity > 97%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) tablets were obtained from MP Biomedicals, LLC. All chemicals were employed as received. Deionized (DI) water was prepared in the laboratory.",y
"In order to fabricate homogeneous casting solutions (17 wt% to 25 wt%), a certain amount of PSF-b-PEG was added to NMP at 60 degC for enough time. Then mechanical stirring device was employed to ensure that the solutes were dissolved completely. The casting solution was deaerated overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 degC and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The casting solutions were scraped on the glass plate with a spatula to fabricate 300 mm-thick films. The films were placed in environment for several seconds before being put in deionized water. Then the membranes were rinsed with deionized water thoroughly to remove the remaining solvent and placed in deionized water for later use. The process for preparing PSF or PSF/PEG blending membranes was the same as above, except that the casting solution was composed of 18 wt% PSF and 82 wt% NMP or 16.6 wt% PSF, 4.4 wt% PEG and 79 wt% NMP.",y
"The membrane surface and cross-sectional morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800). The membrane cross sections were prepared by freeze fracture. A layer of gold particles was sputtered on the surface of the samples to increase its electrical conductivity before SEM examinations. Membrane hydrophilicity was analyzed by a contact angle goniometer (DropMeter A100, Maist), and the average value was obtained by testing at least 3 positions for each samples.",n
"Pure water permeance and rejection to protein (BSA or LZM) were tested by a unit (Amicon 8010, Millipore) with an effective test area of 4.1 cm2. Prior to formal testing, the membrane should be prepressed at 1 bar for 20 min to minimize possible compaction phenomenon. After that, the membrane was tested for 5 min at 1 bar to obtain permeability data. During the whole process, the stirring rate of the unit was 600 rpm to avoid concentration polarization. The membrane rejection performance was characterized by BSA or LZM solution (0.5 g/L). The BSA or LZM concentration was calculated with a UV-Vis spectrometer (NanoDrop 2000C, Thermo Scientific) at the wavelength of 280 nm.",n
"The membrane pure water permeance was determined by Eq. (1):(1)Permeance=VSxtxDPwhere permeance represented the permeance (L m-2 h-1 bar-1) for pure water. V was the volume of the permeation water (L). S is the effective test area (m2), t is the filtration time (h), and DP is the operation pressure (bar).",n
"The membrane protein rejection was determined by Eq. (2):(2)R(%)=Cf-CpCfx100%where Cp and Cf represented the solution concentrations (g*L-1) in the permeate and the feed, respectively.",n
"The mixed PEG solution was used to test MWCOs of the membranes by a module (Amicon 8010, Millipore). The mixed PEG solution was prepared by adding 0.5 g of each of six kinds of PEG with different molecular weights into 1 L DI water. The molecular weights of PEG were 1000, 4000, 10000, 20000, 70000 and 100000 Da, respectively. The test conditions were the same as before. PEG concentrations were measured via gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Waters 1515).",n
The rejection was determined by Eq. (2) and plotted according to different molecular weight rejection. The point where PEG interception reached 90% was considered as the MWCO of the membranes.,n
Theoretical mean pore size (ravg) was determined by Eq. (3):(3)ravg=16.73x10-10MWCO0.557where the unit of ravg was cm and MWCO was Daltons.,n
5 mL BSA solution (1.0 g/L) was added to weighing bottles. Then the membranes (size of 5.3 cm2) were inversed and floated on BSA solution. The weighing bottles were placed at 25 degC for 12 h to reach adsorption saturation. BSA concentrations were characterized in the same way as above.,n
"The membrane static adsorption amount was determined by Eq. (4):(4)SA=(Ca-Cb)xVSwhere SA represented the static adsorption amount (mg cm-2) on the membranes surface. Cb and Ca were the BSA concentrations (mg mL-1) before and after experiments, respectively. V was the volume of the BSA solution (mL) used, and S was the membrane area (cm2).",n
"The fresh platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtain from Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Company, China. PSF-b-PEG membranes and PSF membranes were cut into 10 mm-discs for the adhesion tests. The membrane discs were put individually in the 24-well cell culture plate and PBS solutions were added at 37 degC. After 1 h, replacing PBS solutions with 1 mL fresh PRP in each well. The membrane discs were incubated with PRP for 2 h at 37 degC. Then the membrane discs were washed mildly by PBS solutions for three times and treated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. After 1 h, the platelets have been fixed to the membrane. And the fixed platelets were then dehydrated by graded alcohol-water solutions (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%, each concentration for 10 min), followed by drying overnight at room temperature. The dried membrane samples were then observed by SEM.",n
"As above, the membrane discs (diameter 10 mm) were individually placed in the culture plate and 100 mL platelet-poor plasma (PPP) solution was added to each membrane disc at 37 degC. After that, 100 mL CaCl2 solution (0.025 M) was dripped to each membrane disc. The mixture was softly stirred. The time when the first fibrin thread was noticed was recorded as PRT.",n
"10 mm-size membrane discs were immersed in the normal saline solution for 40 min at 37 degC. After that, 200 mL whole pig blood was dropped and maintained at 37 degC for 1 h. Meanwhile, normal saline and DI water were used as the negative and positive control, respectively. The mixed liquids were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. UV-Vis spectrometer was employed at 545 nm to measure the absorption of liquid supernatant.",n
"The HR was determined by Eq. (5):(5)HR(%)=AS-ANAP-ANx100%where AS represented the absorption value of sample liquid supernatant, AN and AP represented the absorption value of negative control and positive control, respectively.",n
"Hemodialysis simulation tests of the PSF-b-PEG membranes were evaluated according to the studies of Liu et al. [7,8]. The schematic diagram of the test process is shown in Fig. 1. The test area of the PSF-b-PEG membranes was 19.6 cm2. The mixed solution of urea (1.5 g/L) and lysozyme (0.2 g/L), and the solution of BSA (1 g/L) were simulated as blood, respectively. PBS solution was simulated as dialysate. They were forced through the dialysis mode in the reverse direction at the speed of 100 and 300 mL/min. The tests lasted for 6 h, afterwards 20 mL of the test solutions were taken from the outlet of the simulating blood for further analysis.",n
"The clearance of urea, lysozyme, and BSA solutions was determined by Eq. (6):(6)Clearance=QBiCBi-CBoCBiwhere CBi and CBo were the inlet and outlet concentrations of simulating blood, and QBi was the blood inlet flow (100 mL/min). The urea, lysozyme, and BSA concentrations were measured with UV-Vis spectrometer at 420, 280, and 280 nm, respectively.",n
"To study the stability of the PEG component in membranes, we analyzed their surface element distributions after water immersion. The prepared PSF-b-PEG and PSF/PEG membranes were placed in DI water for a certain duration, when the water was changed regularly to prevent bacteria formation. Newly prepared membranes and the membranes stored for a certain time were then characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher K-alpha).",n
"Water contact angle (WCA) data of the PSF membrane and the PSF-b-PEG membranes with a PEG content of 21 wt% were firstly observed, as shown in Fig. 2. The WCAs of the PSF-b-PEG membranes prepared under different concentrations were close, ~62deg, which was lower than the WCAs of PSF membranes, ~86.5deg. The improvement of the membrane hydrophilicity was due to the incorporating of PEG chains into PSF. When the casting solutions were cast on glass plate and immersed in DI water, the hydrophilic PEG chains migrated to membrane surface. PEG microdomains had a diameter of ~20-30 nm and were three dimensionally interconnected with each other, forming a randomly distributed continuous phase in the PSF matrix [29]. Due to the biocompatibility of PEG, the PSF-b-PEG copolymer membranes have potential use to produce biologically inert surfaces.",n
"When blood comes into contact with biomaterials, the first thing that happens is the adsorption of plasma protein. This is the foundation of platelet adhesion and activation of clotting, which further leads to thrombosis [30,31]. According to previous study, proteins prefer to be adsorbed onto hydrophobic materials. In the aqueous system, hydration on the surface of hydrophobic materials affects the subsequent protein adsorption process [16]. In this direction, hydrated protein molecules replace the interfacial water through electrostatic interactions to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium [32,33]. Consequently, membranes with hydrophilic surfaces are considered to have excellent anti-protein adsorption property. Static protein adsorption tests were conducted with BSA solution to study the biocompatibility of PSF-b-PEG membranes. During hemodialysis process, the upper surface of membrane is in contact with blood containing protein. Therefore, in order to avoid the influence of supporting layer, the BSA solution was only in contact with membrane surface by turning over the membrane. As shown in Fig. 3a, the BSA adsorptions on the surfaces of PSF-b-PEG membranes were at a similar lever, which were much lower than that of PSF membrane. Even for the membrane with highest BSA adsorption, the adsorption was only ~7.5 mg cm-2. SEM observation found that there was a large amount of BSA aggregated on the PSF membrane surface (Fig. 3 b). On the contrast, there were no obvious BSA aggregation on the PSF-b-PEG membrane surfaces as shown in Fig. 3 (c)-(g), which further demonstrates that the PSF-b-PEG membrane has excellent anti-protein adsorption ability.",n
"As basic factors, relatively high permeability and precise selectivity are required for hemodialysis membranes. The ultrafiltration performances of the PSF-b-PEG membranes were also measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, with the increasing of copolymer concentrations, the permeance of the PSF-b-PEG membranes gradually decreased from ~400 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 to ~100 L m-2 h-1 bar-1. The decrease of membrane permeance was attributed to the increase of internal mass transfer resistance with the increasing of skin layer thickness (Fig. S1). The rejection to BSA increased when the copolymer concentration was within 21 wt% but decreased with the further increase of concentration. It is probably because that the too high concentration of the casting solution causes the change of phase separation behaviors of PSF-b-PEG in skin layer, which finally leads to the abnormal separation performance. The rejection to BSA reached the peak of ~93.2% and the permeance was ~210 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 when copolymer concentration was 21 wt% (the membrane is named as SFEG-21). For the PSF membrane, the permeance was ~0.5 L m-2 h-1 bar-1, which indicated a significant performance improvement by using PSF-b-PEG. As the molecular weight of BSA is ~66 kDa, which is similar to that of human serum protein (HSA), a protein existed in blood, the results of BSA rejections can refer to the retention of albumin present in blood during hemodialysis.",n
"Hemodialysis membranes should act as a barrier for the transport of large proteins, while small and medium sized toxins can be filtered out. So MWCO is a very important parameter for hemodialysis membranes to check their selectivity. MWCO analysis of SFEG-21 was carried out and the result was shown in Fig. 4b. The MWCO of SFEG-21 was determined to be ~43 kDa, and the calculated pore size was approximately 6.2 nm, which further confirmed the potential use in hemodialysis. Besides, the rejection of SFEG-21 to LZM was ~10.7%, corresponding to previous results. As we known, dialysis-related amyloidosis is a common disease because of retention of middle molecular toxin, like, b-2 microglobulin (14000 Da). The clearance rate of middle molecular can be usually improved by increasing pore sizes, which decreases the risk of developing dialysis-related amyloidosis [34]. We note that high cutoff (HCO) can be used to get rid of cytokines and interleukins for patients suffering from sepsis, acute pancreatitis, and even multiple myeloma [35].",n
"Cross-sectional and surface morphologies of the SFEG-21 membrane were characterized by SEM. According to Fig. 5 (a) and (b), SFEG-21 membrane exhibited a typical asymmetric finger-like pore structure composed of a dense skin layer and a highly porous sublayer featured as finger-like cavities, which was similar with PSF membrane (Fig. S2 (a) and (b)). The SFEG-21 surface image showed that the pores of the skin layer were too small to be represented by SEM, whilst the PSF membrane showed some small pores and gap structure on the membrane surface. Although there were some small spherical structures on SFEG-21 membrane surface, the integral membrane surface roughness was relatively low (Fig. S3). Low surface roughness can also avoid large amounts of protein adsorption [13].",n
"Platelets play an important role in maintaining hemostasis while the aggregation of platelets in blood can promote thrombus formation. SEM images were used to study the platelet adhesion behavior on membrane surface. For hydrophobic surfaces, such as pristine PSF or PLA membranes [1,10], large amounts of platelets aggregated on membrane surface. As shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), there was obvious platelet adsorption on the whole PSF membrane surface. And the adhesion of platelets all exhibited reticulate pseudopodia structure, which indicated the activation of platelets. By contrast, only little platelet was observed on the SFEG-21 membrane surface (Fig. 6 (c) and (d)). PEG is well-known for its super anti-fouling ability to resist protein adsorption [11]. The presence of abundant ether bonds in PEG can tightly combine with water molecules via hydrogen bonding, forming a hydration layer near the surface. The hydration layer is a physical and energetic barrier to prevent the biocomponents from adsorption the polymer surface [36]. Therefore, for the PSF-b-PEG membrane, the PEG chains distributed on membrane surface allow an anti-protein surface, which efficiently suppress the adsorption and aggregation of platelets. Since PEG and PSF are covalently bonded, we can expect that this good anti-adsorption performance of the PSF-b-PEG membranes can be maintained for a long time rather than gradually declines along with the time.",n
"PRT was used to observe clotting time or to determine the absence of clotting factors [37]. When the clotting factor VIII is activated, the thrombin is generated from the clotting progenitor through stepped-activity. After that, thrombin promotes the conversion of fibrinogen from plasma to fibrous protein, which is the basis of thrombus formation. Due to the addition of calcium ions and the activation of factors VIII, fibrous protein cross-links with each other and becomes stable and insoluble. According to the experiment results, the PRT of pristine PSF membrane was 311 +- 5 s. In addition, the PRT of SFEG-21 membranes was prolonged substantially to 409 +- 10 s compared with PSF membranes. The prolonged PRT indicated that the activation of fibrinogen on SFEG-21 membranes was inhibited, owing to the enhancement of membrane hydrophilicity because of PEG chains [38]. It is worth noting that the time is much higher than that of the modified hemodialysis membrane, such as polydopamine-coated PLA membranes (230 s-244 s) and heparin-immobilized PLA membranes (270 s-280 s) (Tab.1). All these results indicated that SFEG-21 membrane surface not only prevented platelets adhesion and weakened the damage to erythrocyte but also inhibited blood coagulation. By using PSF-b-PEG as the membrane material, the hemocompatibility showed significant improvement.",n
"During hemodialysis, blood keeps flowing through the dialysis membranes. In this continuous process, erythrocytes may rupture and release hemoglobin (known as hemolysis) because of the interaction of erythrocytes with the membranes. HR is then employed to determine the extent of injury of the erythrocytes caused by the dialysis membranes. An HR below 5% is considered harmless by ASTMF-756-08 standard. In vitro hemolysis tests were employed on SFEG-21 membrane, and the HR of SFEG-21 was 0.48% +- 0.01%, not only much lower than 5%, but also lower than that of PSF membranes, which was 0.55% +- 0.03%. This result showed that PEG on the membrane surface could inhibit the release of hemoglobin from cells. In general, SFEG-21 membrane has excellent anti-hemolytic activity under this condition.",n
"As shown in Table 1, with relatively high water flux, moderate BSA rejection and outstandingly low hemolysis ratio, the SFEG-21 membranes exhibit superior hemodialysis performances including hemocompatibility compared with other literature works and also commercial hemodialysis membranes. For example, compared to an extensively used commercial hemodialysis membrane (F60S, Fresenius), our SFEG-21 membrane exhibits nearly doubled flux while the rejection is similar. Also importantly, the hemolysis of the SFEG-21 membrane is much lower than the commercial one (0.48% vs. 1.6%). This is mostly because of the PEGylated surfaces and pore walls of the membranes. Besides, we note that the SFEG-21 membranes were fabricated by one-step NIPS process, without using any additives or post-treatments, which can also promote their potential applications in hemodialysis.",n
"The dialysis performances were tested with a solution of urea, lysozyme and BSA as the simulating blood, and PBS solution was employed as the simulating dialysate. The solute clearance rate of urea, lysozyme and BSA were shown in Table 1. It was found that the SFEG-21 membranes showed good clearance to small molecules (urea) at 69.9 +- 5.1 mL/min and to medium molecules (lysozyme) at 46.4 +- 2.2 mL/min after dialysis tests for 6 h, which is close to that of the chemical modified PLA membrane (the urea clearance is over 70 mL/min and the lysozyme clearance is 40 mL/min) [7]. The good clearance of SFEG-21 is owing to their large pore size, excellent hydrophilic and interconnected membrane structure. It is worth noting that small and medium molecular toxins are removed while the beneficial large molecular proteins should be retained in dialysis [42]. The loss of BSA during the 6 h dialysis simulation is used to characterize the loss of beneficial proteins [43]. According to the experimental results, the loss of BSA of SFEG-21 membranes is 8.7 +- 0.6 mL/min. BSA molecules is described as a prolate ellipsoid with a molecular weight of about 66 kDa. The dimensions of BSA have been given as 14.1 nm for the major axis and 4.2 nm for the minor axis. The MWCO of SFEG-21 membrane is around 43 kDa, and the pore size of SFEG-21 is determined to be 6.2 nm, which is smaller than the major axis of BSA. Therefore, the membrane can retain most of the BSA in the dialysis simulation process.",n
"As mentioned above, the possible leaching-out of additives can deteriorate membrane performances and even cause serious safety issues. Thus, the stability of additives is one of the most important properties of hemodialysis membranes. We characterized the surface PEG contents of the SFEG-21 membranes before and after a period of storage in water, to study the stability of PEG components. PSF/PEG blend membranes were chosen as the control group. For better comparison, the addition of PEG to PSF was 21 wt%, and the concentration of the casting solutions was fixed at 21 wt%. To avoid the possible influence of other contaminants during XPS analysis, the membranes were stored in DI water.",n
"Specifically, the stability of the membranes was determined by characterizing the change of oxygen (O 1s) on the membrane surface before and after immersing in DI water for a certain time. O 1s was probed within the scope of 525.08-545.08 eV by narrow scan. The peak at the binding energy of 533.1 eV (Ph-O-Ph) and 531.6 eV (SO) was assigned to O 1s in PSF chains, and the peak at 532.3 eV (C-O-C) was derived from the O 1s of PEG chains [44]. Therefore, the ratio of the area of C-O-C peak to the area of O 1s peak (areaC-O-C) can indicate whether the PEG components are lost during use process. As shown in Fig. 7a, the areaC-O-C of SFEG-21 before and after immersion for three months did not change noticeably because of the covalent bonds between PEG chains and PSF chains. This result indicated the excellent stability of PEG in the SFEG-21 membranes. For PSF/PEG-21 membrane (Fig. 7b), although PEG was partially dissolved in NIPS process, it tended to accumulate on the surface of membrane due to the good hydrophilicity of PEG. Therefore, the areaC-O-C of PSF/PEG-21 before storage is comparable to that of SFEG-21 membranes. However, after three months of immersion, the areaC-O-C of PSF/PEG-21 decreased significantly, from 37.7% to 30.1%. This means that PEG of the blend membranes is easy to be washed out in operating process. By comparison, it can be found that the use of block copolymers as material can basically solve the problem of leaching-out in the process of operation and thus avoid the complications of patients.",n
"The fabrication of hemocompatible and biocompatible PSF-based hemodialysis membranes by one-step NIPS of a block copolymer, PSF-b-PEG, was introduced in this work. Copolymerization of PEG chains into PSF enhanced the membrane hydrophilicity and resulted in better performances, including higher permeability, lower BSA adsorption, less platelet adhesion, extended PRT, and lower HR compared to PSF membranes. The PSF-b-PEG hemodialysis membranes also had high urea and lysozyme clearance as well as low BSA clearance, which promises the removal of toxins and retention of beneficial proteins. Meanwhile, the PSF-b-PEG membranes showed excellent stability in water environment. This simple and effective method to prepare high-performance hemodialysis membranes possesses broad prospects in CKD treatments.",n

"Membrane separation technology is widely used in separation [1,2], concentration [3,4] and purification [5,6] process, possessing the advantages of high rejection coefficient, low energy consumption, convenient operation compared to the traditional technology. Polymeric membranes have been produced in a large scale up to a million square meters per year relying on a nonsolvent induced phase inversion (NIPS) strategy [7-12], which can be further divided into the liquid induced phase separation (LIPS) and vapor induced phase separation (VIPS) according to the phase state of the nonsolvent. During the phase inversion process, a homogenous polymer solution is transformed into the solid-state membrane, which is induced by the exchange between the solvent and nonsolvent. Thermodynamics of casting solution and kinetics in phase separation process are two key factors that determine the final morphologies, structures and performances of polymeric membranes.",n
"Thermodynamics is related to the phase equilibrium among the components of the casting solution, which can be well described by a thermodynamics phase diagram based on the Flory-Huggins theory [13-16]. Iwao Teraoka [17] gets the binodal curve and spinodal curve through theoretical calculation. Consequently, the thermodynamics phase diagram is divided into stable, metastable and unstable regions by two curves, which therefore determines the morphological evolution [18]. We can get cellular-like or nodulous structure via nucleation and growth (NG) mechanism through binodal curve separation and bicontinuous structure via the spinodal decomposition (SD) mechanism. The rapid diffusion or pouring of nonsolvent into the casting solution usually causes high porosity. Generally, membranes with finger-like structure will be produced via instantaneous demixing while a sponge-like structure will be obtained via delayed demixing [16,19,20]. The fast LIPS often results in an asymmetric structure with dense skin layer and finger-like sublayer [15,21,22], while the VIPS process can slow down the diffusion of gas/liquid, leading to a better control of morphology [23]. A combination of VIPS and LIPS enables a unique morphology control and relative quick membrane forming process [10,24-26].",n
"Polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) is a poly (aryl sulfone) polymer with long-term thermal stability (the glass transition temperature, 220 degC the degradation temperature, 503 degC), high mechanical strength, stiffness and high resistance to organic solvent, alkali [20] compared to other sulfone polymers [13,27]. It was found that PPSU nanofiltration membranes were resistant to ethyl acetate, n-hexane, diethyl ether, iso-propanol [15]. Shi et al. [28] introduced the sulfonated polyetheretherketone into PPSU vanadium flow batteries and got an ultrahigh chemical stable membrane. However, most of PPSU microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes showed a relatively low permeability due to its hydrophobic nature of rigid biphenyl moiety and insufficient control of micro-structures [10,13,20,25,27,29-32]. Besides, the low solubility of PPSU in the commonly used polar aprotic solvents such as N-mwthylpyrrolidone (NMP) and DMAc limits the massive adding of pore forming agent such as PVP and polyethylene glycol (PEG) [13,27]. Sulfonated polysulfone (SPSf) are also widely used in the casting solution to control the membrane morphology. For example, Li et al. [33] investigated the effect of SPSf on the compatibility and morphology of polyethersulfone based membranes. Results revealed that membranes with sponge-like structure were successfully prepared and showed excellent water permeability and good antifouling ability. At the same time, Hu et al. [16] found that pregelation of SPSf and water was a good way to tailor the structure of membrane and a small amount of SPSf had a great effect of membrane. Authors also found that the synergy of SPSf and H2O during the membrane formation process could lead to the formation of surface pores and the increase of membrane hydrophilicity. In addition, nonsolvent additives have a more significant effect on membrane morphology because it can lead to the gelation of casting solution which exhibits three-dimensional structure, leading to a delayed demixing. Lin et al. [34] investigated the effect of H2O as a nonsolvent additive on the structure of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) membrane. It was found that macrovoids were completely suppressed with the presence of water. The reason on macrovoids suppression was strongly related to the formation of PMMA gelation induced by water. Hence, due to the significant positive influence of SPSf and water on membranes, they were adopted in this work.",n
The purpose of manipulating membrane structures is to make them better be used to solve real problems and particulate matter (PM) pollution in water and oil-containing wastewater are two of them.,n
"Particulate matter pollution in water detrimentally affects living quality of people, posing a serious health threat to the public. Researches showed that particle size below 2.5 mm can penetrate human bronchi and lungs [35]. It is still a great challenge to remove PM in water. Electrospun polymer membranes and inorganic membranes were found to be applied into the treatment PM in water. For example, Wang et al. [36] prepared a highly porous electrospun polyacrylonitrile for the treatment of nano plastics in water. It was found that the membrane had a great rejection of 0.1 mm polystyrene (PS) at a low pressure (0.6 psi). Gui et al. [37] prepared several inorganic membranes by incorporating SiO2/ZrO2/Y2O3/MgO/ZnO nanoparticles into Ti-48Al-6Nb porous alloy and all membranes showed great performance in PM treatment.",n
"Further, oil-containing wastewater treatment is still a challenge in the world. In all technologies which were used to treat oily water, membrane technology had many advantages such as low operating costs and small environmental footprints [38]. For example, Yang et al. [39] prepared a membrane by co-depositing of mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) on a polypropylene microfiltration membrane. As a result, PDA/PEI coating endowed the membranes with ultra-high water permeability reaching 100 L/(m2h) under gravity with a rejection coefficient of 98% in the separation of dichloroethane.",n
"The objective of this work is to prepare bicontinuous PPSU microfiltration membranes via V-LIPS process and explore the morphology evolution mechanism. Meanwhile, the physiochemical properties and the application for nanoparticles and oil/water separation were also investigated.",n
"PPSU (P875330, Mw = 54,634 g/mol), n-hexane were purchased from Macklin (China) and SPSf (25% sulfonation degree) was supplied by Shandong Jinlan special polymer Co., Ltd. (China). PVP K30 and isooctane were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). DMAc, nano-silica, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5, water solubility is 17 mg/L [40]) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were all purchased from Aladdin (China). Deionized water was used as nonsolvent additive and coagulation bath.",y
"A casting solution with the composition near the binodal curve was more likely to form a membrane with bicontinuous structure because it had more chance to enter the unstable region rapidly or directly [18]. Thus, a precritical casting solution was prepared in this work. Meanwhile, according to the work by Li et al. [33], SPSf had a great compatibility with polyethersulfone (PESU) at the ratio of 16:84. In consideration of PPSU and PESU both belong to sulfone polymers, the same ratio was adopted in this work. At the same time, a low concentration of polymer would be good for the formation of a membrane with a high permeability so 15 wt% would be a good choice for this work. The steps for preparation of such a precritical casting solution were as followed:",y
"First, a certain amount of DMAc was added into the flask, and then different weight percentage of water staring from 0% and then increasing by 0.5% at a time was dropped into DMAc. Afterwards, PPSU (12.6 wt%), SPSf (2.4 wt%) and 20 g PVP (20 wt%, calculated by extra method) were dissolved in DMAc (decreasing from 85 wt% by 0.5 wt% a time) and mixed thoroughly under constant stirring for enough time until a homogeneous solution was formed if possible. The water weight percentage of the casting solution which cannot form homogeneous solution was recorded. Finally, the casting solution prior to the cloudy one was defined as precritical casting solution. To further investigate the properties of the above-mentioned polymer solution, the viscosity and the light transmittance were obtained by a rotational rheometer (Physica MCR-301, Austria) and UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, USA).",y
"The formation conditions of membranes are presented in Table 1. PPSU and SPSf were dried in vacuum oven at 80 degC for 24h before being used. The polymers and additives were dissolved in DMAc under constant stirring at 70 degC until a homogeneous solution was formed. The solution was allowed to settle and cool to room temperature followed by degassing. The solution then was casted onto a glass plate by hands using a casting knife (Biuged BD201, China) with a gap height of 200 mm and immediately transferred to a programmable humidity and temperature tester (BPS-50CL, China) with the condition of 25 degC and 100% relative humidity (RH) for a period of time (from 0 to 30 s). Both air humidity and exposure time can influence the water adsorption into the membrane. And the adsorbed water in the pristine film from the air essentially influenced the porous structure evolution. Herein we varied the exposure time in 100% humidity to better control the water intrusion into the membrane. After that, the glass plate was immediately taken out and immersed into water coagulation bath maintained at 25 degC until the membrane was peeled off from the glass plate. The resulted membranes were transferred into a fresh deionized water bath at room temperature for 24h, and dried in air before testing and analysis.",y
"The surface and cross-sectional morphology of membranes were studied by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4800, Japan). Before measuring, membranes were air dried and fractured in liquid nitrogen followed by coating with platinum.",n
"The surface topography of the membranes was investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker Dimension Icon, USA). Area of 50 mmkh50mm of each membrane was scanned with a scanning rate of 0.498 Hz.",n
"The dynamic contact angle of membranes was measured by an optical contact angle meter (OCA25, Germany). Membranes were cut into appropriate size and mounted onto the glass slide. A drop of deionized water about 3 mL was dropped on the surface of dry membranes. Three random points of each sample were measured to minimize the error.",n
"Measurement of maximum and mean pore diameters were conducted by ""bubble pressure"" method [41] using a membrane pore size analyzer (BSD-PB, China). At the same time, a software called Nano Measurer was used to measure pore size of the upper part, middle part and lower part of 'hour glass' structure.",n
"The porosity of membranes was measured by dry-wet method. Firstly, membranes with size of 2 cm x 2 cm were maintained in deionized water and then they were taken out for wet weight measurement after mopping water on surfaces. Secondly, membranes were put into a vacuum oven with controlled temperature of 60 degC for 24 h and then they were taken out for dry weight measurement. The porosity of membranes was calculated by equation (1):(1)Porosity=Ww-WdrwAd100%where Ww is the wet weight, Wd is the dry weight, rw is the density of pure water (g/cm3), A is the membrane surface area (cm2) and d is the thickness of wet membranes.",n
"Micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Cary 660, USA) was used to investigate chemical functional groups on the surface of membranes. The spectra were collected at the wavenumber from 400 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1 with spectral resolution of 2 cm-1.",n
"The degradation temperature of membranes was measured to investigate the thermal stability of membranes by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA/DSC1, China) at a heating rate of 10 degC*min-1 under nitrogen atmosphere.",n
"To investigate the mechanical properties of membranes, tensile strength and elongation at break were measured by a universal testing machine (Instron 5567, China). Membranes were cut into strips with width of 10 mm and enough length. Thickness was measured by a digital micrometer (CHY-CA, China). The stretching rate was set at 10 mm/min. Three different parts of membranes were tested and then average values were obtained.",n
"According to H. Caquineau et al. [42], the quality of pristine membrane could be measured. The casting solution was cast on a glass plate one after another with a thickness of 200 mm and one was immediately transferred to an electronic balance (BSA224S, Sartorius) placed in the programmable humidity and temperature tester where temperature (25 degC) and humidity (100%) were well controlled, while another one was put in the room atmosphere (25 degC and 60% RH). The mass variation of the membrane during VIPS was obtained by readings from the electronic balance. The viscous solution was casted to a rectangle film with a certain area (10 cm x 10 cm) to assure the comparability of different membranes.",n
"Pure water flux of membranes was measured by a self-made cross-flow filtration system with an effective area of 6.16 cm2. The filtration operation was carried out with deionized water at a pressure of 0.2 bar for 1h. The pure water flux Jw can be calculated by equation (2):(2)Jw=VAxTwhere V is the volume permeated water in 1 h (L), A is the efficient membrane area (m2) and T is the permeation time (h).",n
"The antifouling property of membrane was investigated by 1 g/L BSA normal saline solution. There were two BSA filtration stages and three pure water filtration stages and each fouling stage was 30 min. Between the interval of pure water stage and BSA filtration stage, 20-min pure water rinse was applied to clean the fouled membrane.",n
The membrane M3 was used to investigate the rejection coefficient of SiO2 nanoparticles simulated polluted water and surfactant-stabilized oil in water emulsions.,n
A certain amount of SiO2 nanoparticles was dispersed in deionized water to form simulated nanoparticle polluted solution (100 ppm) under ultrasonic-assistant stirring for 6 h.,n
"M3 was chosen as a sample for the filtration using a self-made cross flow device under the pressure 0.2 bar for 12 h in a mode of concentration of feed solution. Dynamic light scattering (DLS, Zetasizer Nano ZS, UK) was employed to detect the size distribution of SiO2 nano-solution. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, NexION 300X, USA) was applied to analyze the concentration of SiO2 nanoparticles in the permeate solution. Meanwhile, the recovery of filtration flux of SiO2 filtration experiment was also conducted. The experiment was conducted for 3 cycles and each cycle was 4 h. During each cycle, the membrane was simply rinsed by water to demolish the participated SiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of membrane.",n
"Furthermore, to investigate the water-in-oil emulsion separation ability of membrane, n-hexane, isooctane and D5 water-in-oil emulsions (10,000 ppm) were made by adding them respectively into deionized water with continuous mechanical stirring for 12 h 0.1 g L-1 Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) was used as surfactant. M3 was chosen as a sample for the filtration using a self-made cross flow device under the pressure of 0.2 bar. The experiment was conducted in 5 cycles and each cycle was 5 min. The oil concentration of permeate solution was calculated by the carbon concentration which was detected by the total organic carbon analyzer (MultiNC2100, Germany).",n
The rejection coefficient of SiO2 nanoparticles and oil-in-water emulsions were calculated by equation (3):(3)Rx=Cx0-Cx1Cx0x100%where x could be n or e for SiO2 nanoparticles or oil-in-water emulsions respectively. Cx0 and Cx1 are concentrations in feed and permeate solution.,n
"The flux of M3 for SiO2 nanoparticles and oil-in-water emulsions under the pressure of 0.2 bar were also studied and they were calculated by the following equation (4):(4)Px=VxSx*Dtxwhere x could be n or e for SiO2 nanoparticles and oil-in-water emulsions respectively. Vx is the volume of permeate solution, Sx is the effective area of membrane, Dtx is the operation time.",n
"The camera photos, viscosity and light transmittance of the polymer solutions with different weight percentages of water were shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. 1. It could be seen from Fig. S1 that the polymer solution with 3 wt% of water was opaque, indicating the phase separation of such polymer solution. Furthermore, the viscosity and light transmittance were detected. Results obtained from Fig. 1b showed that the viscosity under shear rate of 5 rs-1 decreased from 2994 +- 4 mPa s (no water adding) for to 2607 +- 1 mPa s (1.0% water adding), following by a continuous increase of viscosity from 2854 +- 5.5 mPa s, 2903 +- 7.5 mPa s to 2945 +- 3.5 mPa s, respectively. There was a leap of viscosity (e.g., 3762 +- 31.8 mPa s) when the water weight percentage is 3.0%. It was interesting that the polymer solution without the addition of water had the highest viscosity compared to others (except 3.0 wt%), which indicated that PPSU and SPSf had better compatibility when no water was added. A relatively small amount of water would interact with -SO3- of SPSf or -CO of PVP through hydrogen bonding to disentangle the macromolecular chains between SPSf and PPSU, which therefore caused a decreased viscosity. When more water was added into the solution, more serious macromolecular chain aggregation and entanglement occurred to enhance the viscosity, and a leap of viscosity indicated the phase separation of the mixed polymers.",n
The similar solution behavior can be observed from Fig. 1b. The light transmittance at wave length of 800 nm of polymer solution without water (72.3%) was about 12.6 times higher than that of polymer solution with 2.5 wt% (5.74%) while it soared to 499 times,n
"Higher than that of 3.0 wt% (0.145%), which also indicated the occurrence of phase separation in the polymer solution with 3.0% water. Meanwhile, according various literatures [16,18,22], there would be occurrence of precipitation in casting solution if phase separation occurred. However, it could be seen from Fig. S1 that no precipitation was observed for polymer solution with 2.5 wt% water. Moreover, the polymer solution with 2.5 wt% water owned a relatively high viscosity and low light transmittance, indicating the composition near the binodal curve. Thus, the solution with 2.5% water was chosen as the precritical casting solution for the following membrane preparation.",n
"Mass variations of nascent pristine membrane during VIPS process were presented in Fig. 2. It could be seen from Fig. 2a that the mass of nascent pristine membrane kept increasing in the first hour under the condition of 100% RH. Detailed figure showed that vapor was rapidly absorbed and diffused into the membrane in the first 30 s, e.g., the membrane mass increased by 0.52g in 3000s, in comparison, the vapor adsorption was much slower in room atmosphere(60%RH), e.g., the pristine membrane mass only increased to a mere 0.22g in 3000s in Fig. 2b, and even after that, the mass increment was largely slowed down. Both water intake from the humid atmosphere and solvent evaporation from the membrane mutually influenced the mass variation of membrane. Even in the first 30s, the rapid mass increase indicated a certain amount of water diffusion into the polymer solution, which induced the phase separation in the membrane during VIPS.",n
"The SEM photographs of membrane M0 were presented in Fig. 3. It could be seen that M0 fabricated with NIPS process possessed a typical asymmetric structure with finger-like and macrovoids combined sublayer and dense skin layer. The top surface was smooth and the bottom surface had large pores. A fast diffusion of solvent into the coagulation bath would lead to the rapid aggregation of polymer in the interface so that the dense skin layer was formed. The dense skin layer would hinder the exchange of solvent and nonsolvent from the top surface, then the solvent inside the membranes would be absorbed by the polymer poor phase to form macrovoids. Large pores on the bottom surface were unclosed faces of macrovoids. The finger-like structure could be attributed to the coarsening and coalescence caused by unequal tension between the polymer poor phase and rich phase [33].",n
"It could be observed from Figs. 3 and 4 that membranes M1~M6 displayed a sponge-like cross section with a 'hour-glass' pore distribution from top to bottom, where the large pores were near the top surface and the minimum pore region lied in the cross-section several microns below the top surface, then the pore size increased towards the bottom surface. In order to better show the 'hour glass' distribution of pores in the cross section of membranes, clearer and larger SEM photos were shown in Fig. S2. It could be seen from Fig. S2 (M0~M6) that the minimum pore sizes lied in the region which was away from the top surface for a certain distance and pore sizes increased towards the top surface and bottom surface from the minimum pore sizes region. For better showing the lower part of 'hour glass' structure, a SEM photo of M6 (M6L) was also shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen from the SEM picture (M6L) that pore sizes near the bottom are larger than those near top. Such a change can also be explained theoretically. During the phase separation process, water enter the forming membrane from the top to the bottom. Thus, polymer poor phase near the bottom has more time to grow-the closer to the bottom, more time for polymer poor phase to grow. Thus, pore sizes increase towards the bottom. It was showed in Fig. 4a that the depth of the upper part of 'hour-glass' structure increased in an approximately linear way. The 'hour-glass' structure depths for M1~M6 are 8.1 mm, 15.8 mm, 20.0 mm, 25.8 mm, 29.4 mm and 36.5 mm while the whole cross section was about 150 mm. Meanwhile, average diameters of the upper (I), middle (II) and lower part (III) were shown in Fig. 4c. It could be found that upper part owned the largest pore size (e.g., M3: 640 nm) and middle part had the smallest pore size (e.g., M3: 210 nm), while the lower part had moderate diameters (e.g., M3: 370 nm). At the same time, diameters of all three parts increased from M1 to M6 as shown in Fig. 4c. The specific values were shown in Table S1. Interestingly, it could be observed from Fig. 5a that the inside of upper part skeleton of 'hour-glass' structure was cellular-like while the lower part is solid (Fig. 5b).",n
"Once the PPSU membranes were placed in the VIPS chamber, large number of nuclei were formed on the top surface due to the contact condensed water in humid atmosphere. These water nuclei would join together to form small water droplets as an increase of exposure time in VIPS. Thereafter, small droplets were free enough joining each other to form larger ones. As the process proceeded, water would cover the whole membrane surface, and a liquid layer would form finally [43]. During this process, the water absorbed on the top surface would diffuse into the bulk of the membrane. A precritical casting solution was used in the fabrication of membranes indicating the composition of casting solution was near the binodal curve. For some parts of the upper part of the 'hour-glass' structure, as water penetrated into the bulk, the composition near top surface passed the binodal curve and phase separation occurred via a nucleation and growth mechanism so that cellular-like structure was formed in these parts. With increasing the residence time in vapor, more water penetrated into the membranes, the composition entered unstable region directly through the critical point or passed a narrower metastable region very quickly so that bicontinuous structure was formed via a SD mechanism or became much closer to the spinodal curve. Afterwards, the polymeric membrane was immersed into the coagulation bath and had contact with water. Consequently, the composition entered into the unstable region and bicontinuous structure was formed. The parts with cellular-like structure were wrapped by the bicontinuous structure as shown in Fig. 5, polymer rich phase was squeezed so that the cellular-like structure inside the skeleton was a unique conical shape. Interestingly, the pore sizes decreased from the top surface to lower position in the upper part. DMAc tended to segregate to the membrane surface and caused a solvent gradient and viscosity gradient [42]. Before the solidification of membranes, the formed bicontinuous structure would coarsen and coalesce in order to reduce the free energy between the polymer rich phase and poor phase. As a result, it was easier for a lower viscosity region to form larger pore size than that was high. Consequently, a gradient pore distribution was formed. With the increase of exposure time, the depth of the upper part of 'hour-glass' structure increased from M1 to M6. This phenomenon could be attributed to the vapor penetration into pristine membrane during the VIPS process. It could be observed from Fig. 2a that in early 30s, mass variation of a pristine membrane increased approximately in a linear way, indicating the water intrusion into the viscous film. Linearly increased water adsorption induced linear evolution of porous structure in the upper part of the membrane, while it influenced less on the middle part of the membrane due to restricted diffusion in the viscous solution. Therefore, the depth of the upper part of 'hour-glass' structure increased from M1 to M6.",n
"For the lower part of 'hour-glass' structure, a total bicontinuous gradient morphology was obtained for M1~M6 compared to M0 with finger-like structure in the middle and macrovoids in the bottom of cross section. Simultaneously, it was solid inside the skeleton. Water intake from VIPS process could account for this. During the VIPS process, a certain amount of water was absorbed into the lower part of 'hour-glass' structure, making the composition closer to the binodal curve. The composition, meanwhile, quickly entered the unstable region after immersing into the coagulation bath so that phase separation was conducted via SD mechanism. Consequently, a bicontinuous structure with solid skeleton was formed.",n
"From another point of view, the existence of nonsolvent H2O in the casting solution induced gelation due to the hydrogen bonding formed between H2O and -SO3- of sulfonated polysulfone [16]. The hydrogen bonding network slowed down the transfer and diffusion between the solvent and nonsolvent during the phase separation, which was in favor of the formation of bicontinuous structure. For M0, the network is not strong enough to hinder the nucleation and growth of the polymer poor phase so finger-like structure and macrovoids were found in the cross section. With an increase of time in VIPS, more water penetrated into the membrane so a stronger three-dimensional network was obtained, leading to the formation of bicontinuous structure.",n
"Fig. 3 also depicted the top surface structure of membranes. There were variable-sized pores on the surface of membranes and it seemed that the mean pore size increased while quantity of pores decreased when the exposure time in VIPS increased from 5s to 30s. The reason was the coarsening and coalescence of polymer rich phase. As a result, smaller pores coalesced into bigger ones along with lesser pores on the top surface. The bottom structure was also shown in Fig. 3. There were pores which are smaller than top surface and more evenly distributed.",n
"To further explain the mechanism of such a structure, a membrane fabricated only using VIPS process, and the cast membrane was put into the VIPS chamber with 25 degC and 100% RH for 10 min and then the membrane was taken out in air until the phase separation was completed. The result was shown in Fig. 6. It could be seen that the membrane had less-connected structure in the cross and cellular-like structure was inside the skeleton. It also had a smooth top surface and bottom surface. Obvious coarsening and coalescence behaviors could be found in the cross section and a smooth",n
Top and bottom surface.,n
"AFM photographs of top surface were presented in Fig. 7. It could be seen from the photographs and that VIPS had a considerable impact on roughness of membranes, while the increase of time in VIPS rarely influenced membranes' roughness. M0 possessed the lowest roughness because the fast diffusion between solvent and nonsolvent during the phase separation which entailed a relatively smooth skin layer. Meanwhile, the adoption of VIPS led to the formation of pores on the surface of membranes. These variable-sized pores increased the roughness of membranes.",n
"The physical and chemical properties of the membrane were shown in Fig. 8. The chemical composition of the prepared membranes was investigated by FTIR as shown in Fig. 8a and Fig. S3a. All membranes showed typical spectra of PPSU polymer. The peak at about 1651 cm-1 was assigned to CO and the peaks at 1293 cm-1 and 1321 cm-1 were assigned to OSO. The peak around 1149 cm-1 was ascribed to C-S which indicated the existence of SPSf. Specially, the intensity of CO bond stretch of M0 was obviously stronger than other membranes which indicated that more PVP was retained in M0. This phenomenon also explains the peak at about 3400 cm-1. During the phase separation process, less PVP was washed out of the membrane due to the dense skin layer of M0 so that they aggregated on the membrane surface.",n
"Fig. S3b and Fig. 8b showed the dynamic contact angle of membranes. For membranes M0~M6, the initial contact angle was less than 90deg. It took about 10deg minutes for the contact angle of M0 decreased from 75deg to 10deg, while membranes M1~M6 showed instantaneous wetting behavior in about 2s. The addition of PVP and SPSf significantly enhanced the hydrophilicity. During the membrane forming process, PVP molecules and -SO3- chains of SPSf moved to the surface of membranes due to strong affinity among PVP, -SO3- chains and H2O to reduce the interfacial free energy correlating with FTIR results.",n
"The fabricated membranes with different exposure time in VIPS process were evaluated for their performance in terms of pure water flux and the results were shown in Fig. 8c. It could be seen that pure water flux increased with the residence time in vapor. For example, the pure water flux of M0 was found to be 72.1 +- 3.0 L/(m2h), and then increased to 594.9 +- 20.3 L/(m2h) for M1 followed by an increase to 941.1 +- 32.4 L/(m2*h), 1340.9 +- 12.5 L/(m2*h), 1715.9 +- 24.9 L/(m2*h), 2167.7 +- 43.1 L/(m2*h), 3045.7 +- 42.7 L/(m2*h) for M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 respectively. The initial increase of pure water flux from M0 to M1 was attributed to the improvement of membrane hydrophilicity, the increase of porosity and the disappearance of the skin layer. For membranes with exposure in humid air, pure water flux increased with the increase of exposure time in VIPS due to the increment of mean pore size.",n
"The porosity, maximum and mean pore diameters of membranes were depicted in Fig. 8d. For M1~M6, it could be seen that pore size increased along with the increase of exposure time in VIPS. Obviously, maximum pore diameters appeared in the region near the top surface. As described in section 3.3, with an increase of time in VIPS, the polymer concentration near the top surface decreased, which made for an easier coarsening and coalescence behavior for bicontinuous structure. As a result, M6 possessed the largest pore diameters. Meanwhile, polymer poor phase tended to grow more easily when exposure time in VIPS was longer, which could be attributed to an increased mean pore diameter from M1 to M6. For M0, the mean pore diameter and maximum pore diameter was larger than that of M1 and M2 which was due to the polymer poor phase growth during the phase separation. The porosity of membranes was 88.6 +- 0.72%, 81.9 +- 1.58%, 84.5 +- 0.67%, 85.7 +- 1.60%, 85.2 +- 1.08%, 84.9 +- 1.1% and 86.2 +- 1.6%, respectively for M0~M6.",n
"At the same time, M3 possessed a good thermal stability with a degradation temperature at about 380 degC as shown in Fig. S3c.",n
"It can be seen from Fig. S3d that tensile strength of membranes increases from M0 to M6, with 0.77 +- 0.06 MPa, 1.48 +- 0.11 MPa, 1.77 +- 0.05 MPa, 2.08 +- 0.11 MPa, 2.45 +- 0.14 MPa, 2.81 +- 0.20 MPa and 3.42 +- 0.30 MPa, respectively. M0 has a macrovoids and finger-like combined cross section. Such a cross section often leads to a lower tensile strength compared with sponge-like structure so M0 has the lowest tensile strength (with elongation at break of 0.99% +- 0.19%). For M1~M6, the increase of tensile strength can be attributed to the coarsening and coalescence, which promoted a stronger skeleton.",n
"In order to investigate the filtration performance, M3 was chosen to test its antifouling ability, separation performance for SiO2 nanoparticles contaminated water and water-in-oil emulsions.",n
"In Fig. 9c, the filtration had been carried out for 12 h, and the concentration of SiO2 nanoparticles was measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). It could be observed that the flux of M3 decreased from 512 L/(m2*h) to 185 L/(m2*h) with the increase of filtration time from 1h to 12h. Also evident is the fact that the rejection coefficient kept as high as 96.2% even after 12-h filtration, while that of the first hour was 99.0%. The pore size distribution of M3 and Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data of SiO2 nanoparticles as simulated pollutants and photography of solutions before and after filtration are exhibited in Fig. S5, Figs. 8a and 9b respectively. The obtained results revealed that the as-prepared SiO2 nanoparticles contaminated water before and after filtration had an average particle size of approximately 324.7 nm and 222.7 nm, while that of M3 was about 229 nm. Also evident was the fact that the contaminated water after filtration was much more transparent than the one before filtration. This was due to the excellent filtration performance of M3 which enabled the concentration of contaminated water decreased from 100 ppm to approximately 1 ppm after filtration.",n
"According to the results of DLS, the diameter of some SiO2 nanoparticles was below the minimum pore diameter of M3. As a result, some of these nanoparticles passed the membrane, which led to the rejection coefficient was 99.0% in the first hour. However, it was observed that the flux in the first hour was 512 L/(m2*h) which was much lower than that of pure water flux (1354 L/(m2*h)). SiO2 nanoparticles were stuck in the pores in the membrane. With the filtration proceeding, the rejection coefficient decreased slightly due to the concentration polarization. Meanwhile, flux recovery of M3 during the filtration of SiO2 was tested which was shown in Fig. S4 in which 1-4 h was the first cycle, 5-8 h was the second cycle and 9-12 h was the third cycle. It could be found that filtration flux of 5 h (471.9 L/(m2*h)) was about 93.0% of hour 1 (507.2 L/(m2*h)), while hour 9 (393.6 L/(m2*h)) was 77.6% of that of hour 1. It demonstrated more SiO2 nanoparticles penetrated deeply into the membrane and stuck in the tortuous pores, which were not readily cleaned by the simple rinsing. The comparison with other reported literatures on the performance of nanoparticles separation was shown in Table 2. It could be seen that electrospun membranes and inorganic membranes were reported before. Compared to these membranes, the performance of M3 needs to be further improved by some potential modification such as anti-fouling modification.",n
"At the same time, the antifouling property of the membrane M3 was investigated with pure water filtration and fouling with 1 g/L BSA normal saline solution, respectively. The whole process included three pure water stages and two fouling stages, which was shown in Fig. 9d. It could be seen that the initial flux of M3 remained at a stable state at about 1354.0 L/(m2h). After the first fouling stage, the flux of M3 decreased to 1115.0 L/(m2h), which signified that M3 suffered from fouling. However, the flux at fouling stage remained approximately 80% of the initial value, which could be attributed to the fast speed of the contact of water with membrane surface (Fig. 8b). After stage II, M3 was cleaned with deionized water for 20 min. Apparently, the flux of M3 after clean increased to 1225.5 L/(m2h) which was about 90.5% of the initial value signifying a good antifouling property. The experiment was carried out a second time to assure the phenomenon observed, the flux at stage V was 1156.6 L/(m2h) still reaching 85.4% of the initial value. The rejection rate of BSA in stage II and IV were 4.5% and 5.2%, indicting the sample is a micro-filtration rather than ultra-filtration membrane.",n
"The separation performance of M3 for oil in water emulsions, which were n-hexane/water, isooctane/water and decamylcyclopentasiloxane/water emulsions, was also investigated. The separation performance was evaluated by a self-made cross-flow device. The results in Fig. 10 showed that membrane M3 could efficiently separate the oil droplets with high water permeation and oil rejection. The water permeation flux in",n
"The first cycle was 604.9 +- 11.7 L/(m2h), 535.5 +- 8.2 L/(m2h), 505.1 +- 14.7 L/(m2h) for n-hexane/water, isooctane/water and D5/water, respectively and remained at a high value of 508.4 +- 12.3 L/(m2h), 470.5 +- 8.2 L/(m2h) and 414.1 +- 20.7 L/(m2h) after 5-cycle separation, which indicated a good recyclability. A similar phenomenon was observed for the rejection coefficient, which was 99.5 +- 0.1%, 99.5 +- 0.1% and 98.3 +- 0.1% for n-hexane/water, isooctane/water and D5/water. After 5-cycle separation, the rejection coefficient was still in the vicinity of >99%, >99% and >98%, respectively.",n
"It should be noted that further hydrophilic modification on membranes may improve the anti-fouling performance of membranes. e.g., Hydrophilic oligo(ethylene)glycol methacrylate (OEGMA) [46] or tannic acid (TA) [47], was anchored on membrane surface to improve the membrane fouling to organic matters or oils. Meanwhile, M3 had good performance in oil-in- water separation in comparison of other polysulfone [48-50]or polyethersulfone [51-53] membranes which were also applied into oil-containing water treatment.",n
"PPSU/SPSf microfiltration membranes were successfully fabricated from PPSU/SPSf/H2O precritical casting solution using DMAc as solvent and PVP as a pore forming agent via V-LIPS process. The morphology and performance of PPSU based membranes were significantly affected by the exposure time in VIPS process. The fully bicontinuous structure membranes were obtained when the exposure time in VIPS exceeded 5s. Meanwhile, it was a unique 'hour glass' structure of cross section with cellular-like structure inside the skeleton of the upper part and a solid one inside that of the lower part. The performance was significantly improved by the VIPS process, such as high porosity and good wettability behavior. The pure water flux of membrane with exposure time of 30s in humid atmosphere reached 3045.7 +- 42.7 L/(m2h). Membranes also possessed good thermal stability and antifouling ability. Meanwhile, membranes showed good rejection coefficient and filtration flux in the treatment of nanoparticle contaminated water and oil-in-water emulsions, with 99% and 512 L/(m2h) for the former and 604.9 +- 11.7 L/(m2h) and 99.5 +- 0.1%, 535.5 +- 8.2 L/(m2h) and 99.5 +- 0.1% and 505.1 +- 14.7 L/(m2h) and 98.3 +- 0.1% for n-hexane/water, isooctane/water and D5/water, respectively. Our research shed lights on the fabrication of PPSU membranes with 'hour glass' structure for microfiltration via V-LIPS process. In the future, PPSU microfiltration membranes would be potential candidates in oily and nano-particle involved water treatment.",n
