0,"Today, organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) has proven to be a promising membrane technique. It has the potential for applying in numerous industries, e.g. petrochemical, food, semi-conductor, and especially pharmaceutical ones. It is known that, by using this strategy, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) which possess a molecular weight (MW) from 200 g/mol to 1000 g/mol can be successfully separated from organic solvents, and the valuable organic solvents which are utilized in both pharmaceutical and chemical synthesis approaches can be also recycled with a high yield. In the past, people burnt most of waste organic solvents, leading to the emission of CO2 and many other toxic gases. However, it is an emergent need to recycle and recover waste organic solvents for not only pharmaceutical but also chemical industries because of its significant economic merits. Hence, utilization of low cost, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient OSN methods are necessary for replacing conventional energy separation strategies [1].",151
1,"The solvent resistant nanofiltration membrane is considered as the key part of OSN techniques. Ideally, due to the fact that most APIs possess MWs of about 300-1000 Da, the membranes utilized in OSN processes should have pore sizes as low as 0.5-2.0 nm so that not only the waste solvents recovery but also the purification of APIs can be successfully carried out [2]. However, there are many issues in designing these organic solvent nanofiltration membranes, arising from the lack of chemical stability exhibited by the conventional polymeric membranes in organic solvents [1,3-6].",92
2,"Polymeric membranes are usually inexpensive materials which can be widely utilized for the preparation and convenient scale up of OSN membranes [7]. They have attracted many attention as a result of their potential in numerous applications. However, there are some demerits such as flux decline by passing time, arising from the compaction phenomenon occurred in the membrane, and the requirement of protecting agents, particularly in ISA membranes, which have restricted their applications in some areas [8].",76
3,"Polysulfone (PSf), a traditional aromatic polymer, has proven to be stable in strong acidic and basic environments [9]. PSf is taken into account as a good choice for the preparation of a wide range of membranes, and its prominence is because of its excellent merits including, extensive operating pH and temperature, good mechanical strength and excellent chemical resistance [10]. Moreover, along with the above-mentioned properties, some other outstanding features such as controllable pore size, superb film-forming performance, and excellent thermal stability have also raised its popularity among membrane industries. Nonetheless, they merely have the potential of application in a certain solvent, i.e. alcohols, and they are not able to show chemical resistance in strong polar solvents, considered as a key drawback for this polymer in OSN applications. Accordingly, it is vital to enhance solvent stability of PSf membranes in order to expand their OSN applications [11,12].",146
4,"Cross-linking reactions are considered as considerably powerful approaches for enhancing the stability of polymer membranes and fabricating significantly stable OSN membranes. Along with polyimides, which have been extensively employed in OSN applications, other OSN membranes have been also prepared through performing cross-linking reactions. As previously mentioned, PSf-based membranes are merely able to withstand alcohols in OSN applications. Even after curing with UV light, their properties in polar solvents, e.g. Dimethylacetamide and dimethylformamide, has not been extensively evaluated [9]. Hence, it is necessary to find out a promising strategy for cross-linking PSf membranes. So far, a variety of diamines have been utilized in the previous articles for conducting the cross-linking reactions, and therefore, enhancing the chemical stability of PSf membranes in harsh media [13,14].",123
5,"P-xylenediamine (PDA) and 1,6-hexanediamine (HDA) are two of these diamines which have exhibited good efficiency in enhancing both the chemical resistance and separation performance of membranes for pervaporation [15,16] and OSN applications, respectively [13,14]. Even though the chemical stability and selectivity of membranes can be enhanced via the diamine cross-linking strategy, it also leads to a drastic flux decline [13,17].",60
6,"To address this issue, mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), which are made up through introducing inorganic fillers into polymer matrices, have been suggested. Although the preparation of MMMs for different applications by using MOFs, silica, GO, zeolites, and CNTs, as fillers, has been widely reported in the literature [18,19], their usage in OSN applications is still limited [20]. The incorporation of inorganic materials into polymeric membranes is now considered as straightforward route for the fabrication of the MMMs, in which polymer and inorganic phases can interact with each other through covalent bonds, hydrogen interactions or van der Waals forces, leading to the formation of membranes possessing a variety of chemistries.",109
7,"The fabrication of MMMs can be carried out via three different strategies including dispersion of the inorganic filler into the polymer solution, in-situ polymerization strategy and the sol-gel approach [21,22]. If the inorganic filler has a reactive functional group, covalent bonding can be formed between the inorganic filler and the polymer matrix. Kim et al. investigated the utilization of different NPs in polymeric membranes and listed the extensively utilized fillers for as follows: zeolites, TiO2, silver, silica, and CNTs [23].",80
8,"The membrane properties can be improved through the utilization of polymeric and inorganic phases in mixed matrix membranes, which give a mutually positive effect [21,22]. Nunes et al. [24] reported the fabrication of a composite membrane prepared with considerably dispersed SiO2 and a small amount of APTMS in a polyetherimide (PEI) matrix through in-situ hydrolysis and, subsequently, condensation of tetraehoxysilane (TEOS). It was found that through adding the inorganic filler into the polymer solution, not only did the morphology of the prepared MMM change from finger-like to sponge-like, but also a superior flux ability was obtained. Nevertheless, it is well-known that introducing inorganic fillers into the polymeric membranes generally leads to a flux decline. Another drawback of this strategy is the restriction of the amount and nature of inodzsrganic materials which are utilized in the preparation of the polymeric dope solution. Usually, solubility drawbacks along with non-homogeneity is exhibited through applying a greater amounts of inorganic fillers into the polymer solution. Furthermore, gelation is another phenomenon which can take place in polymer solutions by adding the reactive inorganic material in order to reach homogeneity [24].",185
9,"Silica NPs are extensively utilized for membrane applications owing to their good properties including large-scale synthetic availability, thermal stability, low toxicity, facile synthetic route, and capability of being functionalized with various polymers. It is feasible to manipulate several properties of the final membrane including the crystallinity, shape, particle size and porosity, resulting in their utilization in membrane applications [25,26]. Silica NPs can significantly improve the mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability of PSf membranes [27].",74
10,"In this research work, functionalization of fumed silica NPs was done by APTES molecules and, then, the fabricated amino-functionalized silica NPs were incorporated into a chloromethylated polysulfone matrix in order to fabricate a mixed matrix membrane (MMM). Next, the prepared MMMs were cross-linked by immersing the membranes in an HDA aqueous solution. In order to achieve the optimal loading amount of NPs, a variety of modified silica weight percentages were prepared so that it can be studied how NH2-SiO2 loading can influence the physicochemical properties along with the separation ability of the prepared MMMs for organic solvent nanofiltration applications. It is worth mentioning that, it is the first time that NH2-SiO2/CMPSf MMMs is used for OSN applications.",117
11,"Commercial PSf (Mw=35,000 Da; Ultrason(r) 6010 P) was supplied via BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany) and utilized as the membrane material. 1,4-dioxane and dimethylformamide, were supplied via Merck and utilized for the fabrication of the MMMs. Moreover, for cross-linking the membranes, 1,6-hexanediamine (HDA, >98%, PubChem) was utilized. Methanol, ethanol, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA) with high purity were also employed for evaluating the membrane separation performance. Hydrophilic fumed SiO2 NPs (Aerosil 380; particle size= about 30 nm) were obtained from Evonik. Triethylene glycole (TEG, Sigma) was used as thermal annealing media. Paraformaldehyde (98%), trimethylchlorosilane (>=97%), stannic chloride (SnCl4, 99%), and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES), were obtained from Merck. Reactive red (MW = 1338.1 g/mol), Direct yellow (MW = 947.05 g/mol), Methyl green (MW = 653.24 g/mol), Rhodamine B (MW = 479.02 g/mol), and Crystal violet (MW = 407.97 g/mol) were all supplied via Sigma-Aldrich Co. and utilized as Markers for evaluating the rejection ability of the prepared MMMs in OSN applications.",157
12,"The preparation of chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) was done based on the literature [28] (Scheme 1). Accordingly, PSf (10 g) was introduced into a flask, which was equipped with a reflux condenser, containing chloroform (500 mL), followed by stirring in order to form a homogenous solution. In the next step, paraformaldehyde (6.79 g) and trimethylchlorosilane (24.7 g) were gradually introduced into the above-mentioned PSf solution. Next, stannic chloride (0.6 mL) was slowly introduced into the as-fabricated mixture solution, followed by heating at 55 degC for 2 days. In the final step, the preparation of CMPSf was done through pouring the as-fabricated mixture solution into a methanol bath, followed via drying at 40 degC for 48 h at a vacuum oven.(Schemes 2 and 3).",122
13,"Fumed Silica (0.5 g) was added into 100 mL of Ethanol/deionized water (9:1) solution under sonication, followed via the addition of 1 mL of APTES under stirring at 60 degC for 24 h so that amino-functionalized silica NPs (NH2-SiO2) can be successfully fabricated. The reaction was carried out under N2 gas in a three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a heating system. In the next step, at 9000 rpm, the prepared suspension was centrifuged for 50 min, followed by re-dispersing the precipitates in ethanol by using an ultrasonic bath. The suspension was consecutively purified with ethanol and water for four times, followed via drying under reduced pressure at 65 degC.",112
14,"Vapor-induced phase inversion (VIPS) coupled with non-solvent-induced phase inversion (NIPS) approach was utilized for the synthesis of the mixed matrix membranes. It is well-known that in this approach, membranes can be formed through incorporating of a volatile co-solvent into the polymer dope solution and, subsequently, conducting an evaporation stage before dipping the cast membranes into the coagulation non-solvent bath [13,17,29]. Accordingly, dimethylformamide (as the solvent) and 1,4-dioxane (as the volatile co-solvent) were mixed together at a weight ratio of 3:1 and utilized for the fabrication of the dope solutions. For this purpose, precise amounts of NH2-SiO2 were first introduced into the as-prepared dimethylformamide/1,4-dioxane mixtures, followed via sonicating for 60 min in order to produce homogeneous solution mixtures. Then, CMPSf (20 wt% concentration) was introduced into the as-prepared dispersions, followed by entirely dissolving through stirring at 25 degC for 1 day [5].",141
15,"The NH2-SiO2 loading amounts in the dope solutions varied between 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/g of NH2-SiO2/CMPSf. To fabricate the membranes, the as-prepared homogeneous polymer solution was left overnight to disengage air bubbles before membrane casting and then cast on a glass plate by using a Doctor Blade with a gap of 250 um, then put in a climatic box for 60 s (relative humidity of 65 +- 10% and temperature 40 degC). After the coagulation step, the prepared CMPSf membrane was spontaneously separated from the glass plate through the solvent-nonsolvent exchange. The fabricated membranes were kept in a bath containing DI water for 1 day so that the elimination of the residual solvent can be accomplished, followed via drying at 25 degC. The fabricated MMMs were labelled as M1, M2, M3 and M4, classified according to the weight percentage of NH2-SiO2. The neat CMPSf membrane with 0% NH2-SiO2 was also fabricated as the blank membrane and was labelled as M0 (Fig. S1). The compositions utilized for the preparation of the casting solution are exhibited in Table 1.",180
16,"In order to cross-link the fabricated MMMs via HDA molecules, the membranes were contacted with a 10 wt% HDA solution in DI water for 2 days at 20 degC (Fig. S2). Furthermore, the cross-linker was utilized in an excess amount so that the cross-linking step can be successfully accomplished. Subsequently, IPA was utilized in order to rinse the cross-linked membranes for the purpose of eliminating the residual had molecules and stored in IPA until conducting the organic solvent nanofiltration experiments.",80
17,"NMR spectrometry (VARIAN-INOVA500 MHz) was utilized to record the 1H NMR spectra, in which CD3Cl was utilized as the solvent. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis (AVATAR-Thermo-USA) was utilized for investigating the changes in the functional groups in the polymer membranes. The membranes hydrophilic nature was examined via water contact angle (CA) analysis (Dataphysics, OCA 15 plus). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (PW1730 Philips-Netherlands) was conducted to investigate the crystalline structure of NH2-SiO2 and the prepared membranes in the region of 2th= 10-80deg. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM; BRUKER ICON-USA) was also applied for the purpose of evaluating the surface morphology of all the membranes. The elemental analysis (EDS), SEM mapping, and surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the membranes were also evaluated via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; SIGMA VP, ZEISS, Germany).",135
18,"The mechanical properties of the fabricated pristine CMPSf membrane and NH2-SiO2/CMPSf MMMs were determined using tensile tests, conducted by a Universal testing machine (Santam, model STM-50) with a 500 kN maximum load cell. The prepared samples (length = 20 mm, width = 10 mm) were fixed in two rubber-lined flat pneumatical clamps. To conduct the test, a 10 mm/min test speed was applied to one of the clamps at room temperature.",71
19,"In this research work, we made use of a hand-made dead-end cell for study of separation performance of the prepared membranes, as exhibited in Fig. S3. Accordingly, a feed of dye solution (30 ppm; Table S1) in ethanol was added into the dead-end cell and pushed to permeate through the applied membrane via the pressure as high as 15 bar at 25 degC. The membrane placed in the cell was a round-shaped sample with the effective surface area (A) of 7 cm2. In the next step, Eq. (1) was used to determine the flux (J) of the membrane, in which V (L) corresponds to the volume of permeated solvent, Dt (h) is ascribed to the flow time across the membrane, DP (bar) is related to the applied pressure and A (m2) is related to the effective filtration surface area.(1)J=VtxPxA",139
20,"Eq. (2) was also employed to measure the dye rejection, R (%), of the membrane, as follows:(2)R%=1-CpCfx100",17
21,"In Eq. (2), Cf and Cp correspond to the dye concentrations in feed and permeate solutions, respectively. It is also worth mentioning that the dyes concentrations were calculated via UV-vis analysis (Perkin-Elmer Inc., USA).",34
22,"Some pieces were cut from the prepared cross-linked membranes, and then, they were vacuum dried and weighed in order to investigate their chemical stability in a number of solvents. Subsequently, the membranes were dipped in methanol, ethanol, IPA, acetone, and dimethylformamide for 14 days at 25 degC. In the next step, the membranes were taken out from the solvents, followed by washing with distilled water and drying via a vacuum oven for 12 h. Finally, the dried membrane samples were weighed and, then, their weights were compared with their initial amounts. The determined weight loss percentages demonstrated the outstanding membranes stability in a variety of solvents (Table S2).",108
23,"Based on the literature [30], the long-term immersion test was done on the membrane samples to study their stability in harsh environments. Accordingly, the NH2-SiO2/CMPSf membranes were immersed in dimethylformamide for 30 days and the membrane performance was evaluated in certain intervals.",42
24,"In this step, 1H NMR analysis was utilized to evaluate the chloromethylation of polysulfones (PSf), as depicted in Fig. 1. It is evident in the 1H NMR spectrum of PSf (Fig. 1a) that the peaks appeared at about 6.95-7.87 ppm can be ascribed to the polyhydrogen (H1) of the phenyl group, and the peaks emerged at about 1.71 ppm is related to hydrogens of the -CH3 group. In the spectrum related to CMPSf (Fig. 1b), a new sharp peak has appeared at 4.56 ppm, whose chemical shift is attributed to the hydrogen atoms of the -CH2Cl group. All the above-mentioned findings strongly demonstrate that the -CH2Cl group has been successfully generated on the CMPSf backbone. The degree of chloromethylation (DC) of CMPSf was also assessed at about 125% by using 1H NMR analysis via means of the relative area ratio of the -CH2Cl and -CH3 peaks, which was measured through the equation of DC= 3SH3/SH2, in which S is related to the integral area of the proton peaks [28,31].",169
25,"FT-IR analysis was employed to demonstrate the modification of silica NPs, as depicted in Fig. S4. As can be seen in the spectrum of silica NPs (SiO2 NPs), the peaks appeared at 814 and 477 cm-1 are related to Si-O-Si stretching and Si-O-Si bending vibrations, respectively. The absorption peak emerged at 1101 cm-1 corresponds to the siloxane vibrations of (SiO)n groups. Moreover, the peaks appeared at 1632 and 3436 cm-1 are ascribed to the adsorbed water molecules and the O-H stretching vibrations corresponding to the surface silanol groups, respectively. After the modification of slilica NPs with APTES (NH2-SiO2), some new peaks have been emerged: the peaks appeared at 2921 and 2878 cm-1 are originated from the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations shown via CH2 groups, respectively. The new peak emerged at 1564 cm-1 is also attributed to the N-H bending vibration of amine groups. Additionally, the peak present at 3509 cm-1 can be also related to N-H stretching vibration. According to all these observations, it can be strongly demonstrated that NH2-SiO2 have been fabricated successfully [32].",176
26,"The FTIR spectra of samples before and after cross-linking are also shown in Fig. 2. It is obvious that the peak value related to chloromethylated polysulfone mainly changes at 2800-3000 cm- 1. The peaks appeared at 2969 and 2856 cm-1 are ascribed to the asymmetric stretching and symmetric stretching vibrations of C-H on the methylene group, respectively, which demonstrates that -CH2Cl has been successfully grafted onto PSf after conducting the chloromethyl reaction [33,34]. The absorption peak emerged at about 2909 cm-1 in the spectrum of the non-crosslinked membranes (M0-NC and M2-NC) is related to the absorption of the CH2 group, demonstrating the successful introduction of chloromethyl groups in these membranes. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the intensity of this peak has increased in the M0 and M2 spectra after the cross-linking step, arising from the increase in the number of methyl groups in the membrane matrix owing to adding HDA molecules. After crosslinking step, a new peak has appeared at 3298 cm-1 corresponding to the N-H stretching vibration in the membranes structure.",172
27,"All these changes confirm that the pristine membranes and NH2-SiO2/CMPSf MMMs have been successfully cross-linked by had molecules. It is discernible in the M2-NC spectrum that new absorption peaks have been emerged at about 1609 and 3363 cm-1, related to the O-H bending and stretching vibrations of amine functionalized SiO2, respectively, demonstrating the successful introduction of amine functionalized SiO2 NPs into the fabricated membranes. Meanwhile, the peaks appeared at 1609 cm-1 and 3363 cm-1 disappeared after the crosslinking step which might be owing to the generation of the Si-O-Si bond in an aqueous solution. Also, in the M2 membrane spectrum, the same thing was also observed which might be as a result of the formation of the Si-O-Si bond. Nonetheless, because of overlapping with other peaks in this region, it was not feasible to distinguish the peak related to Si-O-Si bonds [27].",142
28,"In order to evaluate the crystalline structure of the NH2-SiO2 and NH2-SiO2/CMPSf membranes, X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out, as depicted in Fig. 3. A single, broad peak has appeared at 2th = 21@-22@ in the XRD spectrum of the fabricated silica [35-37]. Furthermore, it is discernible in all the samples spectra that a peak has appeared at 2 of 18, the typical peak related to PES and PSf, which demonstrates their amorphous nature [38]. The presence of this peak in XRD patterns of NH2-SiO2/CMPSf membranes demonstrates that NPs have been successfully incorporated into the membrane matrix. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the increased intensity of the peak is related to higher filler loading.",116
29,"The XRD pattern in high percentages of NH2-SiO2 showed wide-open spaces without crystals. In the case of the mixed matrix membranes, by increasing the percentage of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles, the intensity of the peaks declined and the peaks became wider, which suggested an increase in the amorphous areas of the membrane by increasing the amount of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles, arising from the reduction of the order of the chains by adding nanoparticles into the membrane structure. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the peak appeared in the spectrum of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles has shifted to lower angles and overlapped with the peak related to the polymer in the spectra of MMMs [39].",110
30,"The surface SEM images of the fabricated membranes are exhibited in Fig. 4. The silica NPs are easily seen on the surface of the modified membranes in comparison with the unmodified CMPSf one (M0). Nonetheless, it is evident that, as the NPs content reaches to 3 and 4 mg/g (M3 and M4), the modified silica NPs aggregate. Clearly, it is evident that not only the membrane surface morphology but also the particles distributions are varied via an increase in silica loading. According to Fig. 4, the nanoparticles seem to be well distributed on the surface of the M2 membrane. Indeed, through the integration of amine-functionalized silica into the PSf matrix, the reaction between the amine groups provided by the modified silica and the chloromethyl groups present on the CMPSf backbone occurs. Hence, the modified NPs and the polymer chains are covalently bound, which was indicated via FTIR results. Nevertheless, it should be also mentioned that some voids can be observed at higher filler loading amounts.",165
31,"Figs. S5 and 5 exhibit the cross-sectional FESEM images of the CMPSf (M0) and NH2-SiO2/CMPSf MMMs comprised of various NH2-SiO2 loadings before and after the cross-linking modification step. It can be easily discerned that all the membranes possess a typical structure of sponge-like morphology. It can be demonstrated by the FESEM images that the overall cross-sectional morphology of membranes has been affected via the incorporation of NH2-SiO2. It should be noted that no transformation from the sponge-like morphology of the membranes to another shapes has not occurred after the incorporation of a little amounts of NH2-SiO2 NPs (i.e., 1 mg/g of NH2-SiO2/CMPSf). Moreover, the cross-sectional morphologies in the SEM images of the fabricated membranes with and without cross-linking does not show any significant differences. The typical morphologies achieved in this study are exhibited in Fig. 5, which originate from spinodal decomposition. It is well-known that this morphology is attained when the membrane composition crosses the spinodal line, by which an interconnected combination of pores is obtained which looks like a deformed material [40,41].",173
32,"Fig. 5 confirms that the neat PSf membranes fabricated via VIPS coupled with NIPS strategy possesses a sponge-like structure, which is in a good accordance with the literature [40-42]. The presence of NH2-SiO2 NPs results in a decrease in the stability of the polymer solution, and therefore, short time is necessary to spend so that the phase demixing line via the PSf solution is obtained. Accordingly, instantaneous demixing of the casting solution would take place throughout dipping the films in the coagulation non-solvent bath. Conversely, the presence of NH2-SiO2 NPs prevents the solvent-nonsolvent exchange, promoting delayed demixing [27,43,44]. It is worth pointing out that the exchange rate of solvent-nonsolvent decreases via well-dispersed NPs more than via the agglomerated ones, arising from their greater specific surface area [27]. It can be also observed that SiO2 NPs have been distributed in a good manner throughout the PSf matrix.",146
33,"Hence, the hindrance effect of silica NPs leads to a decrease in its effects on the PSf solution instability because of low content and suitable dispersion. Suitable covalent binding between PSf chains and NPs can be achieved by the suitable silica dispersion. For M1, low amounts of NPs agglomeration can be discerned when compared to the other membranes. Through increasing the silica content to 3 and 4 mg/g, it can be seen that NPs have agglomerated, arising from the difference in the density of the PSf solution and that of the incorporated NPs.",93
34,"Fig. S6 exhibits the surface SEM images related to the membranes before and after the cross-linking modification step with HDA. After the cross-linking step, it can be observed that the roughness has decreased on the surface of the M0 and M2 membranes, which is also in accordance with the AFM results (Fig. 8).",53
35,"Moreover, elemental analysis was also carried out to study the elemental distribution on the cross-section of NH2-SiO2/CMPSf MMMs before the cross-linking step, as depicted in Fig. 6. Accordingly, it can be found from Fig. 6a that the M0-NC membrane has been merely composed of C, S, O and Cl, while the modified membranes are comprised of C, S, O, Cl, Si and N, strongly demonstrating the introduction of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles.",70
36,"The distribution of elements in the cross-section of the M0, M2-NC, M2, and M4 membranes was also investigated via FESEM mapping analysis, as depicted in Fig. 7. According to this Figure, it can have discerned that these elements have been distributed uniformly.",42
37,"The particle size histogram of nanoparticles incorporated into the M2 membrane is exhibited in Figs. S10 and S11, based on which it can be discerned that the particles size ranges from 10 to 70 nm. The frequency distribution shown in the histogram demonstrates that almost 80% of the nanoparticles are in the range of 20-40 nm.",56
38,"Fig. 8 exhibits the three-dimensional AFM images (5 um x 5 um) related to the prepared membranes. Is can be found from these Figures that the top surface of the membranes has become rougher after the incorporation of NH2-SiO2 NPs [5]. Additionally, through increasing the NH2-SiO2 loading amount up to 4 mg/g (NH2-SiO2 /CMPSf), the maximum surface roughness is obtained. It is noteworthy that the increase in the surface roughness by increasing the NH2-SiO2 loading amounts can be as a result of the migration of NH2-SiO2 NPs towards the membrane surface throughout the phase inversion process [27]. The surface roughness parameters including average roughness (Ra), root mean-square (Rq), and height difference between the highest peak and the lowest valley (Ry) are depicted in Table S7.",125
39,"Fig. S7 exhibits the AFM images related to the pristine CMPSf and NH2-SiO2/CMPSf MMMs before and after the HDA cross-linking step, based on which it can be confirmed that the cross-linked membranes possess smoother surfaces in comparison with the non-cross-linked ones as a result of the relaxation and pore size reduction throughout the cross-linking step [5]. The surface roughness parameters are also exhibited in Table S8.",66
40,"Figs. 9-11 shows the cross-sectional FESEM, surface FESEM, and three-dimensional AFM images corresponding to the M2 membrane before and after the thermal annealing step. The surface roughness parameters are also shown in Table S9. The surface FESEM and three-dimensional AFM images indicate that the surface morphology of the membrane has become much rougher after conducting the thermal annealing process. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that no differences are clear in the membrane FESEM cross-sectional morphology of the M2 membrane before and after annealing step, as exhibited in Fig. 9. It can be seen in this Figure that a denser skin layer has been formed in the structure of the M2-40 membrane, which is also obvious in its top surface FESEM image, as depicted in Fig. 10c. This may be as a result of performing the thermal annealing in the wet state (i.e., TEG solution), and preventing severe chain packing as a result of the presence of NH2-SiO2 in the cross-section.",159
41,"The water contact angles of the pristine CMPSf membranes and NH-SiO2 MMMs are shown in Fig. 12 and Table S3. It is well-known that the higher water contact angle, the lower the surface hydrophilicity [30]. Furthermore, after the addition of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles to the membranes, water contact angle has decreased, promoting the permeation of polar solvents and leading to a higher solvent Flux. Surface hydrophilicity is an important property of membranes, as it affects their permeance [27].",77
42,"Polysulfone membranes are hydrophobic, which in some applications it would be a disadvantage. Hydrophobicity can result in lower permeance of polar solvents such as alcohols. Modification of polysulfone membranes by means of incorporating hydrophilic NH2-SiO2 is expected to enhance hydrophilicity. It is obvious that water contact angle values have decreased with increasing the loading amount of NH2-SiO2. The increase in hydrophilicity of NH2-SiO2 /CMPSf composite membranes can be explained by the presence of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles in the membranes.",78
43,"Ethanol permeance measurements under dead-end filtration test (Fig. 13) showed that NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles can increase permeance of polar solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, etc. it was found that alcohols permeance was higher for M2 membrane with 2 mg/g of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles content compared to M0 reference membrane with no NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles. It has been reported by many articles that by decreasing the contact angle amount, the hydrophilicity is enhanced [45,46].",71
44,"It is clear that after the cross-linking step, the water contact angle has slightly decreased, which might be as a result of the amine functional groups provided by the reaction between the HDA cross-linker and -CH2-Cl functional groups present on the PSf backbone. The incorporation of NH-SiO2 NPs into CMPSf considerably decreases the water contact angle because of the migration of hydrophilic silica to the membrane surface. Additionally, the contact angle further slightly decreases by increasing the NH2-SiO2 loading amount as a result of enhancing the hydrophilicity.",87
45,"Table S10 lists the mechanical properties of the pristine CMPSf membrane (M0) and NH2-SiO2/ CMPSf MMMs. The presence of NH2-SiO2 in the MMM has improved the membranes mechanical properties, including the elongation at break, maximum tensile stress, and Young's modulus. It is evaluated that the addition of NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles in the PSf matrix affects the mechanical strength of PSf membranes. Besides, it is also noteworthy that high amounts of nanoparticles negatively affect the mechanical properties of membranes due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles [5,27]. Furthermore, the tensile strength of cross-linked membranes increased after conducting the cross-linking step, while the elongation at break decreases slightly, suggesting that the compact cross-linked network structure is beneficial to the mechanical properties of the membranes [47,48]. It has been reported that the cross-linked CMPSf membrane shows better mechanical properties and elongation at break than the non-crosslinked membrane [31].",143
46,"The water, methanol, acetone, DMF, ethanol, and IPA permeance of the cross-linked membranes as a function of NH2-SiO2 loading amounts were investigated, as depicted in Fig. 13a. It was found that the M0-NC membrane showed a higher permeance than the cross-linked ones. It should be also mentioned that the M0-NC membrane showed no permeance for DMF and acetone because the membrane was not cross-linked to show a sufficient stability. It is clear that all the cross-linked membranes permeance have increased by increasing the NH2-SiO2 loading amount up to 2 mg/g of NH2-SiO2/CMPSf. Nevertheless, after the optimum loading of 2 mg/g, the permeance decreased.",103
47,"By increasing the hydrophilic nature, polar solvents, e.g. water, DMF, acetone and alcohols, can be passed much easier through the membranes [49], due to the fact that the water contact angles decrease at great NH2-SiO2/CMPSf loading amounts (Table S3). Nevertheless, the incorporation of small amounts of NH2-SiO2 into the CMPSf matrix leads to a higher permeance, because a further increase in the NH2-SiO2 loading amount enhances hydrophilicity, but because of the amount of NH2-SiO2 NPs in the polymer increases, the silica NPs agglomeration increases and the aforementioned reaction between -CH2Cl and NH2-SiO2 polymer chain rigidification. The water, methanol, acetone, DMF, ethanol, and IPA permeance drop slightly.",106
48,"Fig. 13b shows the membrane rejection as a function of dye molecular weight in EtOH solutions. It is obvious that by increasing the NH2-SiO2 loading amount, the membranes have provided less rejection ability towards small dyes. The M4 and probably M3 membranes shows the most severe loss of selectivity feasibly as a result of the discerned agglomeration of silica NPs. Nevertheless, through a successful use of nanoscale materials, we can be capable of controlling the conventional trade-off favorably. Through the incorporation of a small amount of NH2-SiO2 NPs into the M2 membrane matrix, the highest rejection ability of 99.9%, 98.97%, 91.36%, 85.5 and 81.63 towards Reactive red, Direct yellow, Methyl green, Rhodamine B, and Crystal violet, respectively, was observed.",119
49,"According to Fig. S14, a slight change in CV rejection is observed when the feed concentration increases from 30 to 50 ppm. As you know, if high concentrations of the dye are utilized, a thick cake layer would be formed on the membrane surface, which affects the rejection performance [50-53]. Higher dye concentrations results in an increase in the dye accumulation on the membrane surface, by which dye resistance increases, and therefore, dye rejection becomes higher than those provided when lower dye concentrations are used [51]. Hence, the 30 ppm concentration of dyes in this project was utilized to avoid this phenomenon.",102
50,"Based on Fig. S12, the EtOH permeance and CV rejection of the fabricated M2 membrane were studied through different HDA concentrations. It is clear that through increasing the HDA concentration, the EtOH permeance and CV rejection of the prepared membrane were enhanced until the maximum value reached at 10 wt%. After this HDA concentration, it was found that the EtOH permeance and CV rejection slightly decreased.",66
51,"Also, as can be observed in Fig. S13, the EtOH permeance and CV rejection of the fabricated M2 membrane were studied through different crosslinking times. It is clear that by increasing crosslinking time, the EtOH permeance decreased and acetone permeance increased after 24 h because of the low chemical stability of the M2 membrane, and subsequently, acetone permeance decreased by increasing crosslinking time, that is probably due to the increase in density of the membrane after cross-linking step. It is also worth pointing out that CV rejection of the M2 membrane was enhanced by increasing time, and after 48 h, the increase in CV rejection was negligible.",107
52,"Thermal annealing was conducted on the cross-linked CMPSf (M0) and NH2-SiO2 /CMPSf (M2) membranes so that the separation performance of the membranes can be further improved. Because the M0 membrane is not made up of NH2-SiO2 NPs, the thermal annealing causes densification, and subsequently, low water and alcohol permeance [27]. Accordingly, the effects of annealing on the M2 membrane are only investigated. Fig. 14a shows the study of water, methanol, ethanol, and IPA permeance as a function of annealing in the time of 0-40 min. It is obvious that all the permeance have decreased with increasing the annealing duration. On the other hand, the dye rejection has been enhanced by increasing the annealing duration. Fig. 14b shows the membrane rejection as a function of dye molecular weight in EtOH solutions.",130
53,"In Comparison to the pure membrane (M0), the annealed M2-20 and M2-40 membranes exhibit higher water, methanol, acetone, DMF, ethanol and IPA permeance and greater dye rejections, for the annealed ones possess smaller MWCOs than the pure membrane. For example, the rejection of crystal violet with a MW of 407.97 g/mol is about 81.63% for the M2 membrane, but it has been considerably enhanced to approximately 98.69% after conducting the annealing step at 110 oC for 40 min [54]. Nevertheless, by increasing the annealing time to 40 min, the M2-40 membrane presents lower permeance in comparison to the M0 and M2 membranes although the membrane shows superior rejections when compared to the non-annealed membranes. These permeance declines and rejection enhancement are in accordance with the literature due to the fact that by applying a moderate thermal treatment after the cross-linking step, some enhancement can occur in charge transfer complexes within the PSf matrix, leading to surface densification. It can help the chain packing and enhance the cross-linking degree [5]. As a result, the membrane treated with the annealing step can provide a superior rejection to small molecules while showing a negligible reduction in permeance.",194
54,"Table S2 exhibits the weight loss amounts obtained from the M0 and M2 membranes before and after contacting with a variety of solvents, based on which it can be discerned that the membranes have presented no considerable weight losses. Obviously, HDA functions as an efficient cross-linker which is able to make both pristine (M0) and NH2-SiO2 /CMPSf MMMs (M2) membranes entirely resistant to these five solvents according to weight loss measurements and our observations.",74
55,"Fig. 15a shows the pure solvent fluxes of the M2 membrane (pressure of 15 bar). Table S5 also represents the solvent properties [30,55]. As can be seen, the pure solvent permeance are enhanced by increasing the solvents polarity index. The water permeance proved to be the highest amount among other solvent permeance feasibly because of possessing a lower molar volume than that of the other solvents. Furthermore, it can be easily seen that molar volume and viscosity have increased for alcohols by increasing their molecular weight, and therefore, methanol shows the greatest permeance than the other alcohols. Moreover, the permeance of acetone and DMF is higher than that of ethanol and IPA solvents arising from possessing a larger molar volume. There are numerous parameters influencing solvent transport in organic solvent nanofiltration membranes, i.e. membrane permeation properties, physical properties of the solvent, along with the interaction between solvent and the membrane [55,56].",151
56,"Fig. 15b presents the diagram of the solvent permeance of the M2 sample Vs. the solvent properties (dp,s*Vs-1*es-1, in which Vs, es, and dp,s correspond to the solvent molecular volume, dynamic viscosity, and Hansen solubility parameter,[30] respectively), based on which it is demonstrated that the solvent permeance and the dp,s*Vs-1*es-1 expression are proportional [57,58]. For the purpose of investigating repeatability, some membrane batches were prepared (Table S4).",67
57,"The durability of OSN membranes in the continuous operation tests is considered as an important performance in practical applications. The M2 membrane was chosen for a 72-h operation test under a dead-end filtration mode using a crystal violet/EtOH solution as the feed. As depicted in Fig. 17, the EtOH permeance drops sharply during the first 4 h, and then, the decline is slightly. On the other hand, the crystal violet rejection continuously and slightly increases during the entire 72 h. The initial permeance decline can be attributed to the membrane compaction, stabilization and/or pore blockage due to the solute entrapments [5,59-61]. After the initial 4 h, the membrane permeance and rejection become stable. The EtOH permeance and the CV rejection for the M2 membrane are 0.87 (L/m2.bar.h) and 89.8% after 72 h, respectively. The results indicate that the newly developed membranes possess great potential for real OSN applications with excellent separation performance, which is owing to their robust structure and adequate solvent resistance.",163
58,"Based on the Fig. 18, it is discernible that the size exclusion mechanism has been the dominant one, which mostly determines the separation performance. The basic concept of size exclusion in the membrane separation is that the pore size of these structures is smaller than that of the solutes [62]. It originates from the fact that direct yellow has a negative charge (-2) and crystal violet possesses a positive charge (+1), and it is obvious that the membrane has rejected both of them with high rejection values. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the membranes skin layer is so tight which can reject most of the dyes with different sizes. Furthermore, long-term performance was also investigated, by which it was indicated that both EtOH permeance and rejection performance have not significantly deteriorated by time, which confirms that either no adsorption has occurred on the membranes surface or it has not been significant, not significantly affecting the membrane performance.",158
59,"It is clear that all the membranes have a dense surface layer, which ensures a high dye rejection and a good permeance, which is in accordance with literature [63]. Sponge-like structure membranes, which are prepared via VIPS process, in which a polymer solution is cast as a thin film and the membrane gel is exposed to a humid air at the certain period before immersing in a coagulation bath for inducing solvent/non-solvent exchange to form an asymmetric membrane structure, consist of a skin layer on a more porous support layer of the same material, in which the membrane properties is primarily determined by the densification and compactness of the skin layer of the membranes [64].",115
60,"Table 2 presents the results related to other reported studies, based on which it can be easily proved that better results have been achieved in this study in comparison to the other research studies.",34
61,"In this research work, amino-functionalized fumed silica was first fabricated, and then, added to the matrix of a chloromethylated polysulfone membrane so that a novel mixed matrix membrane could be prepared. Then, through immersing the fabricated membranes in an HDA aqueous solution, crosslinking of the membranes was conducted. Membranes with different NPs loading and annealing time were fabricated so that the effects of these parameters, i.e. NH2-SiO2 loading and annealing time, on the performance of the prepared membranes could be evaluated. The best results could be provided by the membrane prepared with 2 mg loading of amino-functionalized fumed silica. Furthermore, it was indicated that the annealing time has a significant effect on the rejection performance.",115

65,"Nowadays, water shortage and water pollution are increasingly becoming one of global challenges for human survival because of the rapid growth in population and industry [1,2]. Low-cost and efficient methods are demanded for water purification and reclamation, without extra burden to the environment [3]. Compared with traditional separation techniques, membrane technology can solve these problems mentioned above due to its attractive advantages including competitive operating cost, mild operating condition, low energy consumption, unique separation principle and transport selectivity, high separation efficiency and eco-friendly [4,5]. Among them, ultrafiltration (UF) membrane, whose pore size is in the range of 2-100 nm, provides appreciable selective separation. It has been widely used in drinking water production, wastewater treatment, purification and concentration of proteins in bioprocesses, etc [6].",123
66,"Amphiphilic copolymers such as sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF), sulfonated poly (ether ketone) (SPEK), sulfonated poly (ether sulfone) (SPES) and polyethersulfone-co-sulfonated polyphenylsulfone copolymer (PES-co-SPPSU), etc. [1,20-22], have been receiving increasing attention. These amphiphilic copolymers as additives can not only improve hydrophilicity and antifouling properties of the blend membrane, but also endow the membrane with negatively charged characteristic. Sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF), which consists of hydrophobic polysulfone main chain and hydrophilic sulfonate groups [32], is a potential additivefor fabricating membrane [20]. The sulfonate groups on the polymer will endow the surface with negative charge [1]. Besides, the sulfonate groups provide adequate hydrophilicity, which is beneficial for improving antifouling properties of the blend membrane [33,34].",110
67,"This work focuses on the high-performance UF membrane, which is fabricated by blending amphiphilic SPSF into PVC matrix, to improve hydrophilicity and antifouling properties. Three kinds of SPSF with sulfonation degree (SD) of 20%, 30%, and 50% were adopted and blended with PVC via non-solvent phase separation (NIPS) method. The compatibility between PVC and SPSF was firstly evaluated. The surface chemical compositions, morphology, charge, hydrophilicity, antifouling properties and acid/alkali tolerance of the pristine PVC and PVC/SPSF blend membranes were then systematically evaluated and compared. The results indicate that PVC/SPSF blend membrane is promising for water treatment, and SPSF is a perfect additive for PVC membrane modification.",106
68,"Pristine PVC and PVC/SPSF blend membranes were fabricated by NIPS process. The recipes for various casting solutions are listed in Table 1. The detailed fabrication procedure is described as follows. PVC resin and a series of PVC/SPSF blend were first dissolved in DMAc by stirring at 60 degC for 8 h to form homogeneous casting solutions, respectively. Viscosity of the casting solution was measured by Brookfield viscometer (DV2T, Germany) with a shear rate of 100 s-1 at 60 degC. All viscosity data were averaged from three independent measurements, as shown in Table 1. After releasing bubbles under reduced pressure, obtained casting solution was spread onto a neat glass plate via a casting knife with the thickness of 250 um, and then immersed in the coagulation bath (i.e. DI water, 30 degC). Finally, the membrane was rinsed thoroughly with DI water to remove residual solvent and soluble additives, and stored in DI water for subsequent characterization.",155
69,"The compatibility between PVC and SPSF was studied via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, TA Instruments Q200, USA) in nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were first heated from 30 degC to 180 degC at 10 degC*min-1 and maintained at 180 degC for 5 min, followed by cooling down to 25 degC at 10 degC*min-1.",52
70,"BSA, which was used as a model foulant, was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1 M, pH = 7.4). The adsorption mass of BSA on each membrane was evaluated by solution depletion method. The membrane was cut into a circle with an effective area of 1.54 cm2. The sample was placed in 10 mL PBS solution containing BSA (1.0 g*L-1) at 25 degC for 24 h in a sealed cell. BSA concentrations in solution were measured by UV-vis spectrophotometry (HP 8453, USA), considering adsorption wavelength of 280 nm. The mass of protein adsorption on both top and bottom surfaces of membrane was estimated by calculating the differences in initial and final BSA concentrations in the solution. The mass of protein adsorption on each membrane surface is averaged of three measurements to minimize experimental errors.",135
71,"A 90-mL-stirred dead-end UF test cell (Amicon XFUF04701, Millipore, USA; effective area, 15 cm2) was used in the water flux and solute rejection tests with a shear rate of 400 rpm stirring in all experiments. Before each measurement, the membrane was compacted at a pressure of 1.0 bar until water flux became stable. The pure water permeability (PWP, L m-2h-1 bar-1) was measured at an operating pressure of 1.0 bar, and calculated by Eq. (1):(1)PWP=VAtDpwhere V (L) is the volume of the water permeate, A (m2) is the membrane area, t (h) is the operation time, and DP (bar) is the operating pressure.",103
72,"The rejections (R, %) of typical water soluble substances (BSA, SA, and HA) were calculated by Eq. (2). Here, the concentrations of BSA and SA in permeate and feed solutions were measured via UV-vis spectrophotometry (HP 8453, USA) with adsorption wavelengths of 280 nm and 220 nm, respectively. The concentrations of HA solutions were measured by using total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-V CPN, Shimadzu, Japan).(2)R=1-CpCfx100%",65
73,"Here, Cp and Cf are the concentrations of solute in permeate and feed solutions, respectively.",15
74,"In fouling tests, initial pure water fluxes (JW1) of the membranes were adjusted to similar values (~100 L m-2h-1) by changing the applied pressure (P0). The feed solution was then replaced by the model foulant solutions, and the filtration test lasted for 1 h. Three types of model foulant solutions were used, including a protein solution (BSA, 1.0 g*L-1 in 0.1 M PBS, pH = 7), a polysaccharide solution (SA, 1.0 g*L-1 in DI water) and a natural organic matter solution (HA, 1.0 g*L-1 in DI water). During the fouling experiments, the applied pressure (P0) was kept constant. The membrane was then backflushed at 0.01 MPa for 2 min. Finally, the pure water flux (JW2) at P0 was tested again. The flux recovery ratio (FRR, %) was calculated through Eq. (3)[6].(3)FRR=Jw2Jw1x100\%",131
75,"The acid and alkali tolerance of the membranes were evaluated by soaking in hydrochloric acid solution (HCl, pH = 3) and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, pH = 11). After kept in HCl or NaOH solution for a desired period (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 240 h and 720 h), the membranes were thoroughly rinsed with clean water. The pure water permeability (PWP) and BSA rejection were characterized to identify changes of the membranes.",74
76,"The compatibility between PVC and SPSF was first considered, for which would significantly affect structures and properties of the membrane [19,35]. The states of the casting solutions were shown in Fig. 1a. All casting solutions are homogenous and transparent. In addition, glass transition temperature (Tg) can directly reflect whether two polymers are miscible or not. Here, DSC analysis was carried out to identify the compatibility between PVC and SPSF [36,37]. As shown in Fig. 1b, a clear Tg peak is found on the DSC curve of each membrane, verifying monophase of the polymer blend and excellent compatibility between PVC and SPSF [6,27].",102
77,"Surface chemical compositions of pristine PVC membrane and PVC/SPSF blend membranes were determined by XPS, and the results were shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. The oxygen peak (O1s, 530 eV) appears in the XPS spectrum of M0, which is probably due to the residual PEG20k in the matrix. PVC/SPSF blend membranes clearly display the characteristic Cl (Cl2p, 201 eV) and S (S2p, 174 eV) peaks in the XPS spectra [38,39]. It is found that the experimental S/Cl ratios for PVC/SPSF blend membranes and the sulfonate group content on the membrane surface are both higher than their respective theoretical values. The degree of the surface segregation (i.e. the ratio of sulfonate groups on the top surface of the membrane to that in the polymer blend) for M20, M30 and M50 are 1.48, 1.28 and 1.21, respectively (Table 2). The results indicate that there is obvious surface segregation during phase separation process [39]. The strong affinity between the hydrophilic SPSF and the coagulation bath results in the movement of more SPSF to the membrane/coagulation bath interface during phase separation [19,41]. The surface properties of the blend membranes are significantly improved by surface segregation.",193
78,"The top, bottom and cross-sectional morphologies of the pristine PVC membrane and PVC/SPSF blend membranes characterized by FESEM were shown in Fig. 3a. Clearly, all the membranes of M0, M20, M30 and M50 exhibit typical asymmetric morphology. The top surface of these membranes is dense without distinct pore structure under the magnification of x 10,000, while the bottom surfaces show open pores. Besides, there are macrovoid structures support layer in the cross-section of all these membranes. As can be seen the cross-section morphology in larger magnification, the thickness for the sponge-like structure in M0, M20, M30, and M50 is 0.3 mm, 6.9 mm, 4.5 mm, and 1.2 mm, respectively (acquired from Fig. 3a via ImageJ software).",116
79,"In general, the introduction of SPSF has the remarkable effect on both dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of the PVC/DMAc/water system. From the dynamic aspect, it is found that the viscosity of casting solution gradually decreases (Table 1) with the increase of SD of SPSF in the solution. The decreased viscosity is not only mainly caused by the lower molecular weight of SPSF and a lower degree of entanglement between the longer SPSF chains and the PVC chains, but also the poorer compatibility between PVC and SPSF with the increase of SD of SPSF in the blend system.",97
80,"As for the macrovoid structures in cross sections, it is explained as follows. After the formation of dense layer and sponge-structure in the cross-sections, the exchange rate of the solvent and the coagulation bath diffuse into each other is further restrained. As a result, there is sufficient time for the growing the polymer-lean region, then becoming macrovoids. And the liquid film gradually turns to solid membrane from the top to the bottom and the coagulation bath (i.e., water) is aggregated inside the membrane. Different from the top surface, the coagulation bath is gradually aggregated and it provides the sufficient time for the liquid-liquid separation via the nucleation and growth mechanism, and large pores are formed. Especially, the large pores are formed under the macrovoid structures.",125
81,"Topology and the roughness (mean square roughness, Ra) data of the membranes' top surface are also shown in Fig. 3b. Ra for M0, M20, M30, and M50 is 9.89 nm, 16.9 nm, 21.4 nm, and 54.5 nm, respectively, indicating that the surfaces of blend membranes turn rougher with the increasing SD, which is related with the increased surface pore size. The reason for the increasing pore size of the membrane with the increasing SD could be interpreted as follows. Due to the strong affinity between SPSF and water, more water enters the top surface of the liquid film once it is immersed in the coagulation. The polymer-lean region becomes larger to balance the increased interface energy between the polymer-lean region and polymer-rich region. On the other hand, the lower viscosity of the liquid film with higher SD of SPSF lead to the ease phase separation. Both reason results in the larger size of polymer-lean region during liquid-liquid phase separation, and further leading to the larger pore size with the increased SD.",171
82,"The surface hydrophilicity of each membrane was evaluated via air bubble contact angle measurement and the results were listed in Table 4. Compared with the water contact angle method, the air bubble contact angle method is more accurate because it is conducted in the wet state, which avoids changes in the surface chemical composition and physical structure during drying. A higher air bubble contact angle generally indicates a more hydrophilic surface [15,19]. Due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity, pristine PVC membrane exhibits the lowest air bubble contact angle (i.e. 117.0deg). The contact angles of PVC/SPSF blend membranes (M20, M30 and M50) are 131.4deg, 129.0deg and 135.4deg, respectively, indicating the improved hydrophilicity of blend membranes. It is attributed to the surface segregation of sulfonate groups during phase inversion process (Table 2) [19,40,41]. The improved hydrophilicity is expected to reduce fouling caused by adsorption of hydrophobic organic foulants.",145
83,"To evaluate the surface charge, the surface zeta potential of the membranes in wide pH range was characterized and presented in Fig. 5. It is clear that the blend membranes are completely negatively charged in whole tested pH environments (pH, 2.5-11.0), while the isoelectric point for pristine PVC membrane is pH = 3.8. The result indicates that the blend membranes are endowed with negative charge, due to the introduction of sulfonate groups.",72
84,"The membrane performance including permeability and rejection properties were then evaluated. As can be seen from Table 5, with increasing SD of SPSF, the pure water permeability (PWP) of blend membranes significantly increases and reaches up to 880 L m-2h-1 bar-1 (M50), which is more than four times as much as that of pristine PVC membrane (M0, 206 L m-2h-1 bar-1). This is attributed to improved hydrophilicity (Table 4), increased porosity (Fig. 3a) and pore size (Fig. 4), which is favor of generating more paths and channels for water permeation [12,18].",91
85,"However, the solute rejections (e.g. BSA and HA) of M0 is much lower than those of other membranes (Table 5). Although the pore size of the blend membrane is larger than the size of BSA (dimensions: 14 nm x 3.8 nm x 3.8 nm; isoelectric point: pH = 4.7 [42]), the solutes rejections are still higher than 90%, which is mainly caused by electrostatic repulsion between protein and surface (Fig. 5). It should be mentioned that the SA rejection is very low, which is mainly caused by its small particle size [43] andits rigid molecule with small hydrodynamic volume.",99
86,"Static protein adsorption measurement was first conducted to evaluate membrane fouling behavior. In general, the non-specific protein adsorption on the membrane surface due to the inherent hydrophobicity and electrostatic interaction between the membrane surface and proteins [14], and the hydrophobic membrane surface has no significant inhibitory effect on the adhesion of any kind of pollutants [44]. Therefore, improving the hydrophilicity is an effective approach to increase the antifouling property of the membrane to some extent. Here, BSA was used as a typical protein foulant to evaluate the static protein adsorption on the membranes surface. As shown in Fig. 6, BSA adsorption mass on pristine PVC membrane (M0) is 469 mg*cm-2, which is highest among all the membranes, due to its inherent hydrophobic character; whereas BSA adsorption mass on PVC/SPSF membrane surface decreases gradually with the increase of SD of SPSF. M50 exhibits the lowest BSA adsorption amount, that is, 243 mg*cm-2. The improved hydrophilicity of the PVC/SPSF blend membrane leads to the reduced BSA adsorption (Table 4). Moreover, the negatively charged surface further depresses BSA adsorption due to the electrostatic repulsion against the negatively charged BSA molecules in the neutral aqueous environment (Fig. 5).",194
87,"The durable antifouling properties of the membranes were measured by a three-cycle filtration-backflushing measurement using BSA as the model foulant [19] (Fig. 8). The steps are described as follows: pure water is firstly passed through each membrane at an initial water flux of ~100 L m-2h-1 for 1 h, then the feed solution is changed to BSA solution (1.0 g*L-1 in PBS) and the flux is recorded continuously for 1 h. After that the membrane is backflushed at 0.01 MPa for 2 min; however, the backflushing processes are not involving in Fig. 8. One complete filtration-backflushing cycle consists of pure water filtration, BSA solution filtration and a single backflushing process. As shown in Fig. 8, FRR value for M0 over three cycles is ~ 50%, while those for M20, M30, and M50 are ~54%, 77% and 83%, respectively. FRR values for M50 are ~96%, 88% and 83% for 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle, respectively. It implies that the amphiphilic copolymer is stable in the membrane during the application, which is attributed to the excellent compatibility between PVC and SPSF (Fig. 1b). The results confirm the durable antifouling properties of PVC/SPSF blend membrane.",192
88,"Therefore, PVC/SPSF blend membrane shows excellent and durable antifouling properties, and SPSF exhibits its promising potential for membrane antifouling modification.",20
89,"To more intuitively reflect the superiority of the proposed PVC/SPSF blend membrane, PWP, separation and antifouling properties of PVC/SPSF blend membrane (M50) are compared with those of previous related work (Table 6). It is found the lab-made UF membranes generally show high FRR but low PWP with the introduction of amphiphilic segments, such as poly(methylmethacrylate)-graft-poly (ethylene glycol) (PMMA-g-PEG), poly (methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine-co-poly(propyleneglycol) methacrylate (MPC-co-PPGMA), etc. In this work, PWP of M50 is 2-29 times as much as these of the ever reported UF membranes and even commercial hollow fiber membrane [45]. Furthermore, the separation and antifouling performance are compared to the reported UF membranes. The detailed advantages are summarized as follows:",109
90,"1) M50 shows the highest PWP, proving that it has outstanding hydrophilicity and optimized pore structure (Table 6).",18
91,"2) Foulant rejection of M50 is higher than that in Refs. [5,12,13,29,49,51], indicating the superior rejection property.",17
92,"3) FRR of M50 is higher than that in Refs. [5,6,13,29,47-51], indicating the better antifouling property.",16
93,"The acidic and alkaline tolerance of membrane materials is another critical factor, since the membrane is exposed to acid/alkaline environments (i.e. feed fluid with different pH, or hydrochloric acidor sodium hydroxide is usually used to restore flux) frequently [52,53]. It is therefore also important to study the acidic and alkaline tolerance of UF membranes, providing technical support for engineering application of the membrane. To evaluate the acid/alkali tolerance of membranes, PWP and BSA rejections of M50 UF membranes were measured after soaking in acid or alkali solution for a desired period of time (e.g. 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 240 h, and 720 h). As shown in Fig. 9, when the membranes were treated by acid and alkali solutions for 720 h, both PWP and BSA rejection are maintained, indicating the long-term acid/alkali resistance of PVC/SPSF blend membrane, which is promising in water treatment.",145
94,"In this work, the PVC/SPSF UF membranes were successfully fabricated via NIPS method. The presence of a large amount of hydrophilic groups on the surface were attributed to segregation of the sulfonate groups to the membrane surface during fabrication process. The result confirmed the excellent compatibility between PVC and SPSF. The PVC/SPSF blend membranes exhibited the significantly enhanced hydrophilicity, which resulted in the improvement of water permeability and antifouling property. Then new-prepared membrane (M50) showed the highest PWP (i.e. 880 L m-2h-1 bar-1) compared with the ever reported PVC membranes, while the BSA rejection was as high as 95.7% and FRR reached 96%, which were comparable to other PVC membranes. Moreover, PWP and BSA rejection of PVC/SPSF blend membranes were maintained after soaking in hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solution for 30 days, indicating their excellent acid and alkali tolerance. Therefore, SPSF is an excellent additive for PVC membrane modification, and PVC/SPSF blend membrane has extremely high potential in water treatment applications.",162

98,"Lithium is an important strategic resource of countries in the world. It is not only widely used in civilian industries such as batteries, ceramics, glass, lubricants, refrigerants, and photovoltaics [1,2], but it is also an important raw material for nuclear weapons and nuclear fusion [3-5]. In recent years, with the continuous development of electronic products such as computers, digital cameras, and mobile phones, the battery industry has become the largest consumer field of lithium, making lithium a critical resource [6].",80
99,"More than 90% of the world's lithium resources exist in salt lake brines [7]. Globally, lithium salt products produced from brine has accounted for more than 83% of the total [8]. Brine contains coexisting ions such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+[9]. The existence of these ions brings many difficulties to the extraction of lithium, and the biggest problem is the presence of Mg2+ due to the similar chemical properties between magnesium and lithium [10,11]. As well known, the ratio of Mg2+ to Li+ in salt lake brines in China is as high as 100. Therefore, reducing the ratio of Mg2+ to Li+ is critical to the feasibility and economic benefits of separating and extracting lithium salt from brine.",119
100,"Crown ethers are macrocyclic ligands with an ethylene oxide (CH2CH2O)n ring. They have good performance of selectively binding metal ions especially alkalis depending on the size of the ring and the dipole effect of crown ether [29]. In our previous works, benzo-15-crown-5 ether (B15C5) and monoazabenzo-15-crown-5 ether (BN15C5) were grafted onto polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [30] chitosan (CTS) [31] and polysulfone (PSf) [32-34]. polymers. These polymers covalently binding with crown ethers were further fabricated into porous membranes with or without non-woven fabrics substrate. The obtained porous membranes exhibited excellent performance for separating lithium isotopes (6Li and 7Li), and the optimal separation factor reaches 1.065, which is higher than the requirement of industrialization for separation factor (1.03). Furthermore, we also prepared 4'-aminobenzo-12-crown-4 ether (AB12C4) graft chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) porous membrane [35]. The membrane was used for selective adsorption of Li+, and the maximum equilibrium adsorption capability is up to 51.99 mg*g-1. Although the AB12C4 functionalized CMPSf porous membrane has good adsorption performance for Li+, it fails to play the unique screening and separation effect of the membrane ascribe to the large average pore size (around 40 nm).",185
101,"In order to enhance the selectivity for Li+ and exert the separation performance of the membrane, the benzo-12-crown-4 ether with amino group (AB12C4) was grafted onto a chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) dense membrane via in situ surface grafting. The as-prepared PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane was used for selective separation of lithium under an electric field. This research helps to further understand the membrane separation process driven by electric field.",67
102,"Polysulfone (PSf, MW 80 kDa) was supplied by Dalian Polysulfone Plastic Co. Ltd. Chlorotrimethylsilane and 1,3,5-trioxane were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). 4'-aminobenzo-12-crown-4 (AB12C4) was prepared according to the previous work [35]. All of the other reagents were analytical grade from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China).",54
103,"The chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSf) was prepared according to the previous work [33,34]. Typically, PSf (18 g) was dissolved in CHCl3 (500 mL). Chlorotrimethylsilane (60 mL), 1,3,5-trioxane (15 g), and SnCl4 (0.6 mL) were added to the PSf solution. The mixture was kept at 50 degC for 18 h with stirring. Once the reaction solution complete, the mixture was poured into ethanol to obtain the cotton-shaped polymer, which is the crude CMPSf. The pure CMPSf product with a degree of substitution (DS, determined by 1H NMR spectrum [36]) of 0.3 is obtained by dissolving and re-precipitating the crude CMPSf multiple times.",100
104,"The CMPSf dense membrane was prepared by the solvent evaporation. CMPSf (4 g) and PEG-4000 (4 g) were dissolved in DMF (18.2 mL). The mixture was stirred at 70 degC for 6 h to obtain a homogeneous casting solution. Then it was put in a vacuum over for 30 min under vacuum to remove bubbles. Subsequently, the casting solution was poured onto a clean glass plate, and it was cast by a blade knife to obtain a thin liquid film with a thickness of 300 mm on the glass. The thin liquid film and the support glass were put into an oven, and were evaporate at 70 degC. Finally, the CMPSf dense membrane was obtained.",115
105,"For comparison, the CMPSf porous membrane was prepared by the traditional non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. Typically, the thin liquid film and the support glass were immersed into deionized water for the formation of porous membrane. Finally, the pristine CMPSf porous membrane was soaked in freshwater for another 24 h to remove any excess PEG and DMF.",58
106,"The PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane (including dense membrane and porous membrane) was fabricated by the nucleophilic substitution reaction using CMPSf membrane and AB12C4 as raw materials. Briefly, CMPSf membranes were immersed in an aqueous solution with excess AB12C4 in a beaker. The mixtures reacted for 6 h on a constant temperature water bath shaker at 60 degC and 150 rpm. Finally, the PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane was obtained after being soaked in ethanol and pure water. The graft degree (GD) of AB12C4 on CMPSf membrane was calculated by the variation of membrane weight before and after surface grafting as shown in Eq. (1):(1)GD=mCE-mOmOwhere mO and mCE (g) are the weights of membrane before and after graft. The graft degree of the obtained PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane is 12.4%.",122

108,"The chemical structure of membrane surface before and after grafting crown ether were characterized by attenuated total reflection flourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Nicolet Nexus-670, USA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermofisher, K-alpha, USA). The FTIR scanning range is 4000-500 cm-1, the number of scanning is 32 times, and the resolution is 4 cm-1. The XPS spectra were recorded from 0 to 800 eV at a probing depth of 10 nm.",71
109,"The morphologies of the membranes were tested by the scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S4800, Hitachi, Japan). The cross-section of membrane was prepared by freeze-fracture in a liquid nitrogen. The surface and cross-section of membrane were spraying gold before testing. The mechanical properties of the membrane were tested by an electronic stretching machine (HY-580, Shanghai Hengwing, China). The samples were cut into strips (25 x 10 mm2) before testing. The breaking strength (MPa) is used to describe the mechanical property, and the stretching curve is obtained at a stretching rate of 7 mm*min-1[37].",92
110,"The diffusion experiment uses the laboratory-made electric field-driven ion diffusion separation device as shown in Fig. 1. The stainless steel is used as the cathode, the titanium plate is used as the anode, and the distance between the two electrode plates is 50 mm. The crown ether functionalized membrane is fixed in the middle of the diffusion cell. 30 mL of lithium salt, magnesium salt or mixed salt solution was added to the anode cell of the diffusion cell, and 30 mL of ultrapure water was added to the cathode side. A constant voltage DC power supply is used to apply an electric field on both sides of the membrane, so that the metal ions diffuse and migrate across the membrane from the anode cell to the cathode cell under the action of the electric field. The ion concentration of the anode and cathode cells is measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).",155
111,"The diffusion capacity of ions under the action of an electric field is expressed by the ion permeability coefficient U (m*h - 1), and its calculation formulas are shown in Eq. (2) and (3). [38,39](2)U=MAtDC(3)DC=Cf0-(Cf-Cd)ln[Cf0/(Cf-Cd)]where M (mol) is the total amount of ions that migrate across the membrane. A is the effective membrane area (3.14 x 10-4 m2). t (h) is the diffusion time. DC (mol*m - 3) is the logarithmic average concentration between the two-electrode chambers, Cf0 and Cf (mol*m - 3) are the ion concentrations at time 0 and t on the stock side, and Cd is the ion concentration at the diffusion side.",106
112,"The separation factor (a) is the ratio of the permeability coefficients of different ions, as shown in Eq. (4): [38,39](4)a=UMg2+ULi+",20
113,"Firstly, ATR-FTIR was used to characterize the chemical structure of the membrane surface before and after grafting crown ether. The results are shown in Fig. 2. In the spectrum of CMPSf, the absorption peaks at 1589.7 cm-1, 1507 cm-1 and 1488 cm-1 are attributed to the characteristic peaks of the benzene ring on the polysulfone backbone. The peak at 1360 cm-1 is the symmetrical vibration absorption peak of the S = O. The characteristic peaks at 1325 cm-1 and 1298 cm-1 are the asymmetric stretching vibration absorption peaks of the sulfoxide group, while the peak at 1065 cm-1 is the symmetric stretching vibration absorption peak of the sulfoxide group. The absorption peak at 1239.9 cm-1 is ascribed to the anti-stretching vibration peak of .",124
114,"Compared with the FTIR spectrum of CMPSf, a new weak absorption peak appeared at 1637 cm-1 in the spectrum of PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane (as illustrated by the dash line in Fig. 2). This peak corresponds to the characteristic absorption peak of the CN bond formed by the reaction between the chloromethyl group on the membrane surface and the amine group on the crown ether. This result indicates that the crown ether molecules are grafted onto the surface of the CMPSf membrane, and the PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane is prepared.",86
115,"In order to further prove the grafting of crown ether on the membrane surface, XPS was used to characterize the characteristic elements on the membrane surface before and after the crown ether grafted. As shown in Fig. 3, on the CMPSf control membrane, the peaks at 168 eV, 286 eV and 532 eV are attributed to S 2p, C 1 s and O 1 s on the polysulfone backbone, and the peaks at 200 eV are ascribed to the chlorine element on the chloromethyl group. However, in the spectrum of PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane, the peak of Cl element disappeared at 200 eV, and the emission peak of N element was observed at 400 eV. These results indicate that the Cl atoms on the surface of the CMPSf membrane are completely replaced by -NH2 groups. These results indicate that the crown ether was successfully grafted onto the surface of the CMPSf membrane.",150
116,"The surface and cross-sectional structures of PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane were observed by the SEM, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). It can be seen that no obvious membrane pores are observed on the membrane surface, which is consistent with the nature of its water flux close to zero. In the cross-sectional view of the membrane (Fig. 4b), a non-uniform cross-sectional structure was observed. The upper and lower skin layers of the membrane are dense, and the middle part has a honeycomb structure. It shows that the separation membrane with dense surface skin layer is prepared by solvent evaporation method.",100
117,"For comparison, the surface and cross-sectional structures of PSf-sg-AB12C4 porous membrane prepared by NIPS were also exhibited in Fig. 4(c) and (d). It can be found that there are many micropores on the porous membrane surface, and the cross-section of the porous membrane shows a loose spongy pore structure as illustrated in the previous work [35].",56
118,"The breaking strength of the polymer film before and after grafting with crown ether was tested with an electronic stretching machine, and the results are shown in Table 1. The breaking strength of CMPSf dense membrane is 2.95 MPa, while it increases to 4.30 MPa after grafting crown ether. The mechanical properties of polymer membranes are mainly affected by the macroscopic structure of the membrane and the interaction between microscopic molecular chains. For the reaction between AB12C4 and CMPSf membrane, one molecule of AB12C4 can react with two adjacent chloromethyl groups. That is, two PSf polymer chains can be cross-linked by one AB12C4 molecule. Therefore, when the chloromethyl group on the surface of the CMPSf membrane is replaced by AB12C4, the crosslinking between the PSf polymer chains also occurs, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane. This result is consistent with the cross-linking phenomenon of AB15C5 crown ether grafted with CMPSf prepared by the homogeneous (in DMF) method [32].",162
119,"It should be pointed out that the CMPSf dense membrane and PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane have higher breaking strengths than CMPSf porous membrane and PSf-sg-AB12C4 porous membrane as illustrated in Table 1. This is because the mechanical properties of polymer membranes are also affected by the membrane macrostructure. It can be seen from Fig. 4, there are almost no pores on the surface of the dense membranes. The polymer molecules are arranged compactly, and the interaction between the molecules is strong. Therefore, dense membranes exhibit better mechanical properties than porous membranes.",90
120,"Solution pH is a key parameter that affects the adsorption behavior of metal ions. Under the conditions of a voltage of 2 V and an ion concentration of 0.5 mol*L - 1, the effect of pH on the separation factor is shown in Fig. 9. The results show that when the pH of the solution is 3, the separation factor of the PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane for Mg2+ and Li+. is 10.44. As the pH value increases, the separation factor gradually increases. When the pH is 7, the separation factor reaches a maximum value of 32.6, and the separation factor hardly changes with further increasing in pH value. This is because under acidic conditions, H+ in the solution hinders the absorption of lithium ions by the crown ether. The cavities of crown ethers on the PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane are occupied by H+, and Li+ cannot be adsorbed by the crown ether during the diffusion process. That is, Mg2+ and Li+ diffuse to the cathode at the same time, thereby reducing the separation factor.",172
121,"The reusability of the PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane is of great significance to its actual use. Under the optimized conditions of a voltage of 2 V, the ion concentrations of 0.5 mol*L - 1 for Li+ and Mg2+ respectively and pH of 7, 5 cycles of selective dialysis experiment were carried out, and each cycle lasts for 120 min. Before each cycle experiment, the diffusion cell and the membrane were washed with deionized water repeatedly until no metal ions can be detected. The results are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that after 5 cycles of experiments, the separation factor still remains around 32. This result illustrates that the performance of PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane is stable and can be reused after being rinsed with deionized water.",125
122,"In addition to Mg2+, there are co-exiting ions such as K+, Na+ and Ca2+ in the real salt-lake brines. In order to study the effect of these coexisting ions on the separation performance of lithium ions, Li+ was mixed with Na+, K+, and Ca2+, respectively. and the device in Fig. 1 was also used to study the separation performance of Li+ and these coexisting ions, and the separation factor results are listed in Table 2. It can be seen from the table that the separation factors of the other coexisting ions (K+, Na+ and Ca2+) to Li+ are higher than that of Mg2+ to Li+. This is because these coexisting ions have poor size matching with crown ethers (AB12C4). The ion diameters of Li+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+ and K+ are 1.36, 1.44, 2.00, 2.04 and 2.76 A, respectively [40]. While the cavity diameter of AB12C4 is around 1.20-1.50 A [41]. These results suggest that the PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane coupling electric field has good separation performance for Li+.",167
123,"For traditional electrodialysis, a number of alternate cation exchange membranes and anion exchange membranes are placed between the cathode and the anode. Under the action of direct power supply, the anions and cations in the water migrate towards the anode and cathode respectively [42]. While in this work, the membrane used is a dense crown ether grafted polysulfone membrane. Unlike traditional ion exchange membranes, the PSf-sg-AB12C4 membrane allows both anions and cations to pass through the membrane driving by concentration difference and electric field. During this process, both metal ions and counter ions migrate from anode to cathode, and Li+ ions are rejected by the membrane due to the large amount of crown ethers on the membrane surface as shown in Fig. 11. Herein, the crown ethers on the membrane surface act as adsorption sites to trap Li+, while Mg2+ migrate across the membrane freely, and the migration rate of Mg2+ are accelerated under the action of electric field. Thus, the PSf-sg-AB12C4 dense membrane exhibits good separation performance for Mg2+ and Li+.",172

126,"Advantages of inorganic-polymer nanocomposite membranes include simultaneous improvement of dye rejection and water flux thanks to an increased hydrophilicity of the membrane surface (Doustkhah et al., 2021; Nambikkattu et al., 2021) and imparting photocatalytic and antibacterial properties to the membrane (N. Liu et al., 2020; Bouziane Errahmani et al., 2021). Moreover, morphological features of the inorganic-polymer nanocomposite membranes, such as pore size, porosity, surface roughness, etc., may translate into improved membrane efficiency (Darabi et al., 2018), and/or improved thermal stability of the membrane or other mechanical properties (Hoek et al., 2011).",91
127,"Methods commonly employed to chemically modify the inorganic nanomaterials used in polymer membranes and to improved nanoparticle-polymer compatibility include surface modification (Sun et al., 2008), surface functionalization (Zeng et al., 2016; Zakeritabar et al., 2018), and organic grafting on nanoparticle surfaces (Xu et al., 2022). It has been shown that grafting polymers on nanomaterial surfaces leads to less nanoparticle agglomeration and improved membrane stability. For example, Zhi et al. (2014) grafted a hydrophilic poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly (methyl methacrylate) (PHEMA-b-PMMA) polymer on SiO2 nanoparticles and observed improved dispersion of the resulting modified nanoparticles in a PVDF membrane. Compared to the unmodified SiO2 nanoparticles, presence of the PHEMA-b-PMMA-grafted SiO2 nanoparticles in the polymer membrane led to an enhancement in the pure water flux and membrane surface hydrophilicity. Moreover, reduced bovine serum albumin (BSA) fouling was observed for the membranes. Other similar researches have also reported on nanofiller modification using polymer grafting and its effect on nanocomposite membrane performance (Liu et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2018). In all these reports, agglomeration of the nanoparticles was observed to be suppressed and water flux, as well as membrane surface hydrophilicity, were observed to be enhanced.",191
128,"Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a water-soluble polymer which is used both in dope solution to fabricate hydrophilic substrate (Abdallah et al., 2018) or as an amine monomer for interfacial polymerization process (Shirzad Kebria et al., 2015). However, to our knowledge, there are no paper about use of PEI coated SiO2 nanoparticle for modification of polysulfone membranes. The grafting of PEI on SiO2 surface could enhance compatibility of the nanoparticle within the polymeric matrix and inhibit the agglomeration and the SiO2 nanoparticle could effectively improve the PSF membrane properties.",87
129,"In this study, SiO2 nanoparticles were firstly prepared and then grafted with hyperbranched polyethylenimine (PEI) to obtain modified PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were next added to a PSF membrane to fabricate a PEI-SiO2/PSF nanocomposite membrane through the NIPS method. It was hypothesized that nanoparticle surface modification would improve the nanoparticle-polymer interfacial interactions in the PES membrane and prevent nanoparticle agglomeration. Another hypothesis was that the hyperbranched PEI chains could provide amine groups on the SiO2 nanoparticles with an increased surface hydrophilicity of the PSF membranes as a result. Finally, the performance of the PEI-SiO2/PSF nanocomposite membranes were determined.",98
130,"PSF was purchased from Arvand Co., Iran. N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), a PSF solvent, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a pore forming agent, were obtained from Merck Co., Germany. BSA, a natural foulant, was provided by Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany. Reactive Green 19 (RG19) dye with a molecular weight of 1419 g mol-1 was purchased from Azar Dye Co., Iran.

131,"For the synthesis of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles, hyperbranched PEI with a molecular weight of 60,000 g mol-1 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany. Epoxy silane coupling agent, [3-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-propyl]-trimethoxy silane (EPPTMS), ammonium hydroxide (32%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol, and dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Merck Co., Germany. All chemicals were used as-received.",51
132,"SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using the Stober method (Jouyandeh et al., 2018, 2019). Specifically, 50 mL ethanol was mixed with 3 mL ammonia solution for 10 min. Next, TEOS was added to the solution in the amount of 4 mL, followed by mixing of the solution for 24 h at the ambient temperature. The final synthesized nanoparticles were separated from the mixture by centrifugation (Hettich, Universal 320) at 6000 rpm for 10 min, repeatedly washed with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight.",86
133,"In the first step, silane-modified SiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by mixing 2 g SiO2 and 1.5 mL EPPTMS in 25 mL DMF at 80 degC for 24 h. The resulting nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation, washed with DMF, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight. In the second step, 2 g PEI was dissolved in 50 mL DMF and 2 g silane-modified SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the mixture under continuous stirring for 24 h at 80 degC. The resulting yellowish-color PEI functionalized SiO2 (PEI-SiO2) nanoparticles were finally separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, repeatedly washed with ethanol and DMF solvents, and dried in an oven at 70 degC overnight.",115
134,"To evaluate the membrane filtration performance, a dead-end filtration system with four cells (an effective area of 19.6 cm2 and capacity of 250 mL) was used (Vatanpour et al., 2021a). For this purpose, the membranes were first pre-compacted at a pressure of 4 bar for 20 min to reach steady water flux. Next, the pure water flux, PWF (Jw1, L m-2 h-1), was calculated using the following formula and data obtained at room temperature and 3 bar for 90 min (Amiri et al., 2020):(1)Jw1=MADtwhere M, A, and Dt are permeated water volume (L), membrane effective area (m2), and permeation time (h), respectively. All filtered solutions were stirred to reduce the concentration polarization phenomenon during membrane separation. Moreover, each experiment was repeated three times and the average PWF values were calculated.",130
135,"The protein rejection and antifouling performance of the as-fabricated membranes were evaluated by an aqueous solution of BSA. For this purpose and after the completion of the PWF tests, the dead-end cells were rapidly refilled with the BSA solution (200 mg L-1). Next, the BSA solution flux (Jp, L m-2 h-1) was measured after 60 min under the same operating conditions as before (room temperature and 3 bar). The following formula was used to calculate the percentage rejection (R) of the BSA solution in the membranes based on the BSA concentrations in the permeate (Cp, ppm) and feed (Cf, ppm):(2)R(%)=(1-CPCf)x100",100
136,"The BSA concentrations were measured by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance of the BSA solutions at lmax = 260 and 280 nm. After the BSA filtration test, the membranes were removed from cells, rinsed, and put in deionized water for 20 min. The clean membranes were then reinserted in the dead-end cells and a second PWF (Jw2, L m-2 h-1) calculation was performed. At the end, membrane flux recovery ratio (FRR) was calculate using the following formula (Rabiee et al., 2015):(3)FRR(%)=(Jw2Jw1)x100",79
137,"To evaluate fouling in the PSF, SiO2/PSF, and PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes, quantities such as membrane intrinsic resistance (Rm), membrane pore resistance (Rp) and cake resistance (Rc) were calculated using the following formulas:(4)Rm=DPeJw1(5)Rp=(DPeJw2)-Rm(6)Rc=(DPeJp)-Rm-Rp",31
138,"Finally, once the second PWF calculations were completed, the cells were emptied and quickly filled with a 100 ppm Reactive Green19 dye solution to evaluate the dye separation performances of the membranes under the same conditions as before. Next dye fluxes were measured and dye rejection percentages were calculated using Eq. (4). The permeate and feed concentrations of the dye were determined by UV absorbance at lmax = 633 nm.",70
139,"In Fig. 2a, the FTIR spectra of the SiO2 and PEI functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles are provided. In the spectrum of the SiO2 nanoparticles, the absorption bands related to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of the Si-O bonds are observed at 799 and 1095 cm-1, respectively (Tikhani et al., 2019). Also, the absorption band of the vibrations of the Si-OH bonds appear at 952 cm-1. Moreover, a broad peak between 3300 and 3700 cm-1 is associated with the stretching vibrations of the O-H groups.",83
140,"The small bands observed at 2828 and 2940 cm-1 in the FTIR spectrum of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2a) confirm the presence of CH3 and CH2 bonds, which were created when SiO2 nanoparticles were modified with the silane coupling agent and PEI. The band at 1457 cm-1 is indicative of the stretching vibrations of the C-H bonds in the structure of PEI. In the case of PEI-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles, the absorption band attributed to the N-H bonds appears at 1624 cm-1 (Tan et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2017).",88
141,"TEM images of the SiO2 and PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2e and f, respectively. Based on these images, the average diameter of a single SiO2 spherical nanoparticle is about 30 nm. However, the diameter increases to about 35 nm for the PEI functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, the presence of the PEI layers around the SiO2 nanoparticles can be discerned in the TEM image of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2f). The observed contrast between the PEI layer and SiO2 nanoparticles is due to the density differences between the two materials.",91
142,"Thermal degradation of the SiO2 and PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles were examined by TGA and the results are given in Fig. 2g. The slight mass loss observed below 200 degC is attributed to the evaporation of residual moisture and solvent on the nanoparticles (Karami et al., 2019; Jouyandeh et al., 2021; Seidi et al., 2021). Above 200 degC, thermal degradation of the nanoparticles was significantly influenced by the presence of PEI on the of SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2g). Specifically, considerable weight loss was observed for these nanoparticles as a direct consequence of the PEI functionalization of the SiO2 nanoparticles (Ghiyasi et al., 2018). For comparison, a weight loss of about 2.54% was recorded for the SiO2 nanoparticles at 840 degC, while the corresponding weight loss for the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles was around 17.3%. Based on the TGA data, a grafting ratio of about 14.8% can be deduced for PEI on SiO2 nanoparticles.",149
143,"In Table 1, the room-temperature water contact angles, mean pore sizes, porosities, and casting solution viscosities of the PSF and nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes are given. The largest contact angle is observed for the neat PSF membrane (no embedded nanoparticles). By the addition of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles (up to 2 wt%) to the PSF membrane, the water contact angles show a decreasing trend (Table 1), which is attributed to the increased hydrophilicity of the membranes (Yuliwati and Ismail, 2011). Also, a comparison between the observed water contact angles on the surfaces of 1 wt% SiO2/PSF and 1 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes (Table 1) reveals a less hydrophilic (larger contact angle) surface for the former than the latter (Kotobuki et al., 2021).",118
144,"Presence of hydrophilic PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the PSF membrane further affects the porosities and mean pore sizes of the membranes, with both increasing with an increase in the concentration of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the membrane. At the same time, an increase in the viscosities of the casting solutions is observed. This viscosity increase with an increase in the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticle concentration in the casting solution is responsible for a slower de-mixing process and formation of larger pores in the membranes.",81
145,"Surface and cross-section morphologies of the PSF and nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes were obtained by SEM, EDX, and AFM. The corresponding images are shown in Figs. 1S, 2S and 3S, respectively. By investigating the SEM images of the cross sections of the membranes in Fig. 1S, a porous, finger-like, and asymmetric morphology is observed for all membranes with a dense layer at the top. This top layer mainly affects water flux though the membrane and BSA/dye rejection. In the case of the neat PSF membrane (Fig. 1S(a)), interactions between the nonsolvent (water) and solvent (DMAc) during phase separation leads to a porous microstructure with asymmetric, finger-like pores. With the addition of hydrophilic PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles to the PSF membranes, porosities of the resulting membranes increase with increasing nanoparticle concentration (Fig. 1S(b)-(f)). This observation seems to be rooted in the increased hydrophilicity of the casting solution and the connectivity between the pores (Rabiee et al., 2015).",153
146,"EDX is a convenient method to investigate the dispersion of nanoparticles within the nanoparticle-modified membranes. The inorganic hydrophilic nanoparticles added to the casting solution tend to migrate to the membrane surface and agglomerate once nonsolvent (water) is added to the solution and phase separation/membrane formation occurs. This nanoparticle agglomeration tendency is attributed to the a low compatibility between the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix, often leading to the blocking of smaller pores and increase in the membrane surface roughness (Rabiee et al., 2015). In Fig. 2S, presence of the PEI chains on the SiO2 nanoparticles in the PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes qualitatively leads to an improved nanoparticle dispersion in the polymer matrix. As a consequence, an increase in membrane porosity is observed. In contrast, the tendency of the SiO2 nanoparticles to form clusters in the case of 1 wt% SiO2/PSF membrane can be discerned in Fig. 2S(f), where a nanoparticle cluster is clearly seen. In addition, a non-uniform dispersion of the nanoparticles in the PSF matrix in the case of 1 wt% SiO2/PSF membrane (Fig. 2S(f)) leads to a reduction in membrane porosity.",181
147,"Figs. 1S and 2S related to cross-sectional SEM and EDX-mapping shows that the thickness of the membranes is slightly different, although all of the membranes were casted with 150 mm. During the coagulation process, the thickness of the membranes reduces due to the shrinkage effect (Stropnik et al., 2000). The type and concentration of the nanoparticles could influence on the shrinkage amount of the membranes (Q. Liu et al., 2020) and therefore, the thickness of the membranes could be changed. Also, during the breaking of membranes in the liquid nitrogen for preparing samples for cross-sectional SEM images, some compactions maybe occurred.",101
148,"Tensile properties (tensile strengths and elongations at break) of the PSF and nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes are compared in Fig. 4S. A slight increase in the elongation at break is observed for the nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes compared to that of the neat PSF membrane. Also, the tensile strength of the nanoparticle-modified PSF membrane increases steadily with the addition of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles to the polymer up to the nanoparticle concentration of 2 wt%. It seems that the greater compatibility between the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles and the polymer matrix, as described before, a uniform dispersion of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, as well as and the creation of an interconnected porous structure in the PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes are all responsible for the observed trend in the tensile strengths (Safarpour et al., 2016; Barzin et al., 2018). Interestingly, the addition of 1 wt% of SiO2 nanoparticles to the polymer matrix leads to a pronounced increase in the tensile strength of the resulting nanoparticle-modified PSF membrane, more so than the addition of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles (Muntha et al., 2021). All the above observations are attributed to the fact that the SiO2/PSF membrane is stiffer than the corresponding PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane, as described before.",197
149,"The PWF of the neat PSF and nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes were calculated at the operating pressure of 3 bar and the results are shown in Fig. 3. A steady increase in the PWF of the PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes is observed with increasing PEI-SiO2 nanoparticle concentration when compared to the PWF of the neat PSF membrane. This observation is due to the fact that the PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes are more hydrophilic and have greater porosity than the neat PSF membrane (Table 1). Increased membrane hydrophilicity means increased water uptake capacity and, hence, improved water flux. In addition, the more porous structure of the membrane reduces the resistance to water passage through the membrane, again resulting in increased water flux through the membrane. As it can be seen from Table 1, the hydrophilicity and porosity of 1 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane are higher than those of the 0.5 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF. However, Fig. 3 shows that their pure water flux is basically the same. It could be related to the agglomeration of the NPs in the higher concentrations, which block the membrane pores and as well as the decrease of membrane effective surface because of the reduction in membrane average roughness (Woo et al., 2015).",199
150,"Based on Fig. 2S(e), it looks the membranes with 2 wt% PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles loading has some agglomerations and the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles moved toward the top of the membrane, which can reduce the flux of this membrane to be lower than other membranes with a lower percentage of nanoparticles like (1 and 0.5 percentages of PEI-SiO2). But, according to Fig. 3 a and 3b, the 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane showed the best performance. This could be related to this fact that other parameters such as hydrophilicity, pore size, porosity and surface roughness can affect on the membrane performance. As it can be seen from Table 1, the hydrophilicity and porosity of 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane are higher than other PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes and these parameters overcome the reduction of membrane flux due to the agglomeration. Another useful comparison is between the PWF of 1 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF and 1 wt% SiO2/PSF membranes. Clearly, the PWF of the former is significantly higher than the latter, again explained by the hydrophilicity and porosity of the former being greater than the latter. Similar results have been previously reported for other nanoparticle-modified polymer membranes (Shen et al., 2011; Leo et al., 2012; Vatanpour et al., 2012).",199
151,"Proteins and other organic materials tend to be adsorbed/deposited on the surface or absorbed in the pores of membranes, causing membrane fouling and, hence, reduction in the flux, shortening of service life, and increase in the operating costs of membranes. For these reasons, proper membrane material design is critical for achieving optimal membrane antifouling performance (Rana and Matsuura, 2010; Padaki et al., 2015a). The PWF results for before (first water flux) and after BSA solution filtration (second water flux) are given in Fig. 5S. All membranes (neat and nanoparticle-modified) exhibited similar trends in the PWFs and BSA solution fluxes with the former being larger than the latter. During the passage of the BSA solution through the membranes, interactions between the BSA molecules and the membrane components lead to the formation of a protein layer on the membrane surface and membrane fouling occurs. The 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane is observed to yield the highest water flux than the other membranes (Fig. 5S) thanks to the presence of a large concentration of hydrophilic PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles and more porosity in the membrane (Rabiee et al., 2015).",183
152,"When the 1 wt% SiO2 blended membrane is compared with 1 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane, it is observed that the PEI-SiO2 contained membrane has better antifouling performance due to good dispersion of PEI-SiO2. Surface roughness parameter results showed that the average roughness of 1 wt% SiO2/PSF membrane was 10.6 nm, whereas this is for 1 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane was 4.7 nm. Therefore, due to low surface roughness, the fouling of the 1 wt% PEI-SiO2 blended membrane is lower. Similar findings have been reported for other nanoparticle-modified polymer membranes elsewhere (Leo et al., 2012; Koulivand et al., 2019).",96
153,"Values of the intrinsic resistance (Rm), cake resistance (RC), and pore resistance (Rp) of the neat PSF and the nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes are provided in Fig. 4b. In this figure, the main type of resistance to PWF is intrinsic resistance. Nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes are observed to reduce the intrinsic resistance, predominantly because of the addition of hydrophilic PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles. The results also indicate that incorporating PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the PSF membrane causes a drop in both RC and Rp (Amiri et al., 2020). Similar observations are made in the case of 1 wt% SiO2/PSF membrane (Fig. 4b).",97
154,"RG19 dye flux and rejection results of the neat PSF and nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes are provided in Fig. 5. Interestingly, the dye rejection performance of all membranes, neat and nanoparticle-modified, are about 100%. This high rate of dye separation can be correlated with the small sizes of the synthesized membrane pores, as well as the bulky structure and high molecular weight of the RG19 dye. The flux of RG19 solution increases steadily with the addition of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles to the PSF membrane, from about 92 L m-2 h-1 in the neat PSF membrane to about 195 L m-2 h-1 in the 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane. This dramatic increase in the dye solution flux is again attributed to the increase in the hydrophilicity and porosity of the nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes with increasing concentration of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, a 65% increase in the dye solution flux of the 1 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane compared to that of 1 wt% SiO2/PSF membrane (Fig. 5) again attests to the greater hydrophilicity and porosity of the former than the latter (Amiri et al., 2020; Vatanpour et al., 2021b).",183
155,"During application and storage of membrane, there is a possibility to release of the embedded nanoparticles from the membrane matrix, which could reduce the membrane performance. The blended nanomaterials could be released from the nanocomposite membranes via dissolution, desorption, passive diffusion, and polymer matrix composite degradation (Ghalamchi et al., 2019). The leaching of Si as an indicator of SiO2 nanoparticle from the membrane body was evaluated during 14 days by immersing and stirring the membranes in deionized water at 30 degC conditions, as presented in Fig. 6S. In the first days of tests, the Si leaching was increased, but, after that, the amount of Si amount was constant with the increase of time and after 14 days, the release of the nanoparticle is almost finished and 92% of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles were remained in the membrane body.",137
156,"A study of the membrane morphologies revealed that all fabricated membranes had asymmetric, finger-like, porous structures with their porosity level increasing by an increase in the concentration of the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles. Also, the dispersion of PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles in the PSF matrix was found to be better than that of the SiO2 nanoparticles.",52
157,"Tensile strengths of the nanoparticle-modified PSF membranes, i.e., PEI-SiO2/PSF and SiO2/PSF membranes, were observed to be higher than that of the neat PSF membrane with the highest value observed for the SiO2/PSF membrane followed by that of the 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane. Pin the case of the latter, presence of PEI chains on the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles was deemed to cause a greater compatibility between the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix, leading to a homogeneous nanoparticle dispersion in the polymer and, hence, improved mechanical properties of the membrane.",87
158,Water permeation results for the membranes revealed that improved membrane porosity and hydrophilicity in the PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes leads to higher pure water flux than that observed for the neat PSF and SiO2/PSF membranes. Maximum water flux was recorded for the 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF membrane.,44
159,"Due to the presence of large number of amine groups on the PEI-SiO2 nanoparticles, excellent hydrophilicity is observed for the PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes compared to the SiO2/PSF membranes. As a consequence, the PEI-SiO2/PSF membranes show improved antifouling properties.",37
160,"Based on the obtained permeability, FRR and dye rejection, the 2 wt% PEI-SiO2/PSF was selected as optimum membrane due to high flux and high fouling resistance.",26

166,"Membrane process has become a basic separation technology and plays an important role in the water treatment, which possesses numerous unique advantages, including low energy consumption, high separation efficiency, no chemical or phase change additives, modular structure, convenient maintenance, etc [1-3]. Current membranes can be fabricated from organic polymers, inorganic materials, and their composites. In contrast to inorganic membranes, polymeric membrane displays excellent performances, low cost and ease of handling [2,4,5]. Therefore, it has dominated the separation membrane market.",79
167,"Polysulfone (PSF) is one of the most suitable polymers commonly employed for membrane fabrication owing to its high thermal and wide pH resistances, good chemical stability and mechanical properties [6-8]. However, PSF membrane encounters low permeability and severe fouling during the water filtration process owing to its hydrophobic nature, which will reduce membrane lifetime and increase additional operation cost. Various approaches have been employed to improve the hydrophilicity of PSF membrane surface, which mainly includes surface grafting [9,10], surface coating [11,12], and surface segregation [13]. Surface grafting and coating are usually carried out in the post-modification process, and surface segregation is generally achieved in the membrane formation with amphiphilic materials. Specifically, hydrophilic segments of the amphiphilic copolymers segregate to the membrane surface and pore wall in the phase inversion due to their low interfacial energy with the coagulation bath of water, and hydrophobic segments are firmly anchored within the membrane owing to their hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction with polymer matrix [14,15]. Namely, surface segregation is an in situ modification technology, by which the membranes can obtain the three-dimensional modification, excellent antifouling properties and long-term stability.",183
168,"Among various amphiphilic copolymers, SMA (anh) is easily synthetized, less costly and commercially available, and has been widely used in the membrane modification [16-20]. In our previous study [17], it is observed that the transformation of SMA (anh) into SMA could increase the miscibility with poly (vinylidene fluoride), leading to the uniform pore structure in the resultant membrane. Importantly, the composite membranes exhibited good permeate flux, separation and antifouling properties due to the segregation of SMA. However, it is unclear if this strategy is suitable for PSF membranes because the interaction of SMA with PVDF and PSF should be different. Moreover, it is noticed that amphiphilic copolymers can simultaneously act as the surface modifier and pore forming agent in the membrane formation process [4,21,22]. Rong Wang, et al. [23,24] reported the effects of amphiphilic Pluronic block copolymers on the polyethersulfone and PVDF membranes, and concluded that their hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction with polymer membrane matrix delayed the solidification process, resulting in a very strong pore-forming ability.",164
169,"Based on our previous study and inspired by the above pore-forming mechanism, herein, SMA was utilized in the modification of PSF membranes as a surface modifier and pore forming agent. Effects of the transformation degree of SMA (anh) into SMA on the membrane formation were systematically investigated by controlling the anhydride ring opening reaction time. Significantly, the pore-forming ability of SMA was analyzed according to its hydration and interaction with PSF matrix, yielding insight into the pore-forming mechanism. In addition, polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) with different molecular weights were used to further optimize the membrane microstructure in combination with SMA, and their cumulative effects were explored in view of the hydrogen bonding and degree of molecular chain entanglement. The surface wettability, permeability, rejection and antifouling performances were examined to assess the usefulness of the resultant membranes in the water separation applications.",144
170,"PSF (Udel(r)P-3500, Mw ~ 78000 Da) was supplied by Solvay Co., Ltd. (Brussels, Belgium).

Other reagents were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The non-woven PET (thickness~140 mm) was obtained from Suzhou Tuopusi Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. (Suzhou, China).",72
171,"PSF/SMA composite membranes were created by the phase inversion technology using DMAC as a solvent (Fig. 1), without or with PEG or PVP as the second additives. Given amount of PSF, PEG, PVP and SMA were dissolved in DMAC to form homogeneous casting solutions by continuously stirring at 70 degC for 24 h. After degassing, the casting solution was spread at a non-woven fabric using an applicator (thickness:300 mm), and promptly immersed in the deionized water to construct the membranes. In addition, PSF/SMA (anh) membrane was also prepared through the similar process and set as a control. In the end, all membranes were always immersed in the deionized water before tests.",111

173,"The permeability was evaluated by a cross-flow filtration system, where the effective membrane area was 22.1 cm2. The membrane was pre-compacted at 0.2 MPa for 0.5 h using pure water as the feed solution, and then the filtration tests were performed at 0.1 MPa for 1 h to achieve the pure water flux Jw1 (L/m2 h bar) according to equation (1).(1)Jw=VADt",61
174,"where V, A and Dt represent the filtrate water volume (L), membrane area (m2) and filtration time (h), respectively.",19

176,"where Cp and Cf (mg/L) are the concentrations of permeate and feed solutions, respectively.",14
177,"After BSA solutions were filtrated, the membrane was cleaned and again used to test the pure water flux (Jw2). Flux recovery ratio (FRR) was reckoned according to the equation (3) to assess the antifouling property.(3)FRR=Jw2Jw1x100%",35
178,"According to the literature [24], the pore-forming ability of amphiphilic copolymers depends on their interaction with polymer membrane matrix to some extent. Therefore, the pore-forming ability of SMA during the PSF/SMA membrane formation was explored by adjusting their interaction. Based on the results reported in our previous work [17], the anhydride groups of SMA (anh) were opened upon interaction with alkaline solution yielding two carboxylates to confirm whether the formation of SMA similarly increased the interaction with PSF. With increasing the ring-opening reaction time, the transparency and homogeneity of the PSF/SMA dope solution increased compared to those of the PSF/SMA (anh) dope solution (Fig.S1a). Moreover, it is also observed that the PSF/SMA membranes exhibited lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) than that of the PSF membrane (Fig.S1b), indicating that the PSF intermolecular interaction was reduced due to the SMA chain interference. Notably, the Tg values of PSF/SMA membranes gradually decreased with extending the ring-opening reaction time. The phenomena implied that the PSF-SMA interaction was enhanced.",164
179,"In order to enhance the permeate flux, separation and antifouling performances, SMA (anh) was utilized to adjust the PSF membrane microstructure via the transformation into SMA. It is discovered that SMA acted as a pore former and amphiphilic surface modifier in the fabrication of PSF membrane by the NIPS process. Significantly, the dual role can be simultaneously manipulated by controlling the transformation degree of SMA. As more anhydride rings of SMA were opened, uniform small pores were constructed on the membrane surface, whereas long finger-like pores were formed in the membrane cross-section due to the improved interaction and pore-forming ability for SMA. Moreover, PEG and PVP with different molecular weights were used to further optimize the membrane microstructure as the second additives. Intriguingly, due to the strong hydrogen bonding and chain entanglement with SMA, high-molecular-weight PEG was anchored on the membrane surface together with SMA. Consequently, the as-prepared membranes exhibited the optimal surface hydrophilicity, the highest permeate flux and excellent antifouling properties, and largely outperformed other similar PSF composite membranes. This work proposes a novel strategy to adjust the dual role of the amphiphilic copolymer in the membrane fabrication as a pore former and amphiphilic surface modifier.",197

(6)[49]:(6)P=VAtDpwhere V is the volume (L) of the permeate, A (m-2) is the effective test area, t (h) is the testing time, and Dp is the transmembrane partial pressure (bar, 1 bar=0.1 MPa).",100
197,"The BSA rejection was measured by the following Eq. (7):(7)R=Cf-CpCfx100%where Cp and Cf (mg*ml -1) are BSA concentrations in permeate and feed solutions, respectively.",24
198,"The PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB were furfure verified by FTIR. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the carbonyl bands at 1700 cm-1 were significantly enhanced with the increase of carbonyl group. Compared with PESSB, the new peak at 1360 cm-1 and 1390 cm-1 corresponds to the himaldimethyl groups in PSF-PESSB50 and PSF-PESSB67. Furthermore, the bands at 1030 cm-1 corresponds to SO3-, which indicate the increase of zwitterion groups. Thus, the FTIR spectra indicate the successful preparation of PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB. All the characteristic absorptions for the three kinds of polymers were consistent with the expected structure and indicated the successful synthesis of PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB. Table 1 showed the molecular weight of each polymer prepared.",116
199,"The thermal properties of these polymers were evaluated with TGA in nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 4, initially, the first weigh loss of the PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB was occurred at 179 degC, which is attributed to the decomposition of the quaternary ammonium groups. The second weight loss stages occurred across a temperature range of 200-400 degC, which corresponds to the zwitterion groups. PSF showed a starting decomposition at about 456 degC, which corresponds to the decomposition of polymer backbone. It is thus verified by TGA that the zwitterion-containing polymer had an excellent thermal stability for antifouling membrane applications.",100
200,"The mechanical properties of dense membranes and asymmetric membranes were further tested. As shown in Table 2, compared with PSF, PSF-PESTA50 showed increased tensile strength, tensile modulus and strain elongation, which was due to the rigid structure in polymer backbone. Compared with PSF-PESTA50, PSF-PESSB50 showed an increased strain elongation, reduced tensile strength and tensile modulus. The reduction in the tensile strength was mainly due to the introduction of hydrophilic groups while an increased strain elongation was attributable to the zwitterionic polymers containing more aliphatic moiety than PESTA, which makes polymer chains more soft and flexible [50]. Meanwhile, the decreasing stiffness of the polymer reduced the tensile modulus.",107
201,"The morphologies of the cast membrane are critical for the performance in application. As shown in Fig. 5, cross-sectional and surface morphologies of the membranes were characterized by SEM. According to Fig. 5, all membranes exhibited a typical asymmetric finger-like pore structure composed of a dense skin layer and a highly porous sublayer.",53
202,"The prepared membranes were characterized by AFM to investigate the surface morphologies as shown in Fig. 5. The light and dark areas represent the membrane matrix and pores, respectively. Modified membranes displayed similarly in morphology with PSF membranes. As shown in Table 3, membrane surface roughness was measured with the Ra (mean roughness), Rq (the root mean square of the Z data) and Rz (the mean difference between the highest peaks and lowest valleys). According to reports, surface roughness may be a function of surface pore size. The results showed that the membrane surface roughness decreased slightly with the increase of the zwitterionic group content, indicating that although zwitterionic group was introduced through surface segregation, it had little effect on the morphology of the membrane and surface pore size.",129
203,"Surface hydrophilicity of membranes is a major influence of the permeability and antifouling property of membranes. We characterized the hydrophilicity of the dense membranes first to better understand the hydrophilicity of the polymer. The zwitterion-containing polymers exhibited improved hydrophilicity and the PESSB showed the best hydrophilicity among the all polymers. As shown in Fig. 6, the contact angle values of pristine PSF, PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB asymmetric membranes were 90.4deg,74.8deg, 57.2deg and 43.9deg, respectively. By increasing the proportion of zwitterionic groups, the hydrophilicity of the membranes was enhanced significantly. It could be concluded that zwitterionic groups were induced to membrane surface by water during the phase inversion process. The zwitterionic groups can form a dense hydration layer through electrostatic interactions (each zwitterionic unit contained a positive charged group and a negative charged group with at most eight water molecules via electrostatic interactions) that resulting in super water affinity of the modified membranes [51].",153
204,"Biofouling of membrane surfaces is an essential issue to be solved. The adsorption and accumulation of pollutants both on the membrane surface and in the pores will lead to smaller pore size and therefore increased membrane resistance. After the surface proteins are adsorbed, blood cells will combine with specific proteins through receptors, thereby adhere to the surface of membranes [19]. To evaluate the antifouling properties of membranes, protein adsorption experiments were firstly conducted to test the antifouling ability of the modified membranes. BSA was used as a model pollutant to study the adsorption capacity on various membrane surfaces. Fig. 7 showed the static adsorption of proteins on the asymmetric membrane surface. Obviously, a large amount of BSA protein was adsorbed on the surface of PSF membrane. Compared with PSF, PSF-PESSB50 displayed low BSA adsorption and almost no BSA adsorption on the surface of PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB membranes. The antifouling properties of zwitterionic-containing copolymer membranes are strongly related to the presence of a hydration layer near the surface as the tightly bound water layer forms a physical and energy barrier to prevent surface adsorption of proteins. The results showed that the modified membranes possessed obvious antifouling performance.",196
205,"In order to further study the antifouling ability of the membranes, dynamic antifouling properties of the membranes were evaluated by the parameters including flux recovery ratio (FRR), total flux decline ratio (Rt = Rr + Rir), reversible flux decline ratio (Rr) and irreversible flux decline ratio (Rir). As shown in Fig. 8(a), as the proportion of zwitterionic groups increased from 0 to 100%, the Rt and Rir decreased from 42% to 26%, and 36% to 5%, respectively. The results showed introducing zwitterionic groups considerably improved the irreversible protein fouling. The improvement of antifouling performance was attributed to the hydrophilicity and the charge of membrane surface. BSA molecules possessed negative charge in pH = 7, thus the adhesion of BSA was reduced with the increasement of zwitterionic groups due to the strong repulsion generated by electrostatic interactions between BSA molecule and sulfobetaine groups [52]. FRR was directly consistent with Rir, and it increased as Rir decreased. PESSB membranes possessed a high FRR of about 95% when compared with the PSF membranes (only about 64%). Based on the filtration dynamitic experiments, the introduction of zwitterionic groups is effective in reduce the permeation resistance of the membranes.",194
206,"Blood cell adhesion is the critical attribute in the evaluation of hemocompatibility materials. Blood cell adhesion and activation occur after the formation of protein adsorption layer on the membrane surface, due to blood cells tend to stick to surfaces through adhesion receptors on platelets that bind to specific proteins [51]. Platelet adhesion and activation predominate in vascular thrombosis and occlusion.",60
207,"The hemolysis ratio was measured to assess erythrocyte stability and membrane safety, which is also an important aspect of hemocompatibility of the membrane. As shown in Fig. 10, the hemolysis rates of these membrane materials were all lower than 5%, indicating that the membrane materials were in line with the biological evaluation of medical devices. Among them, the hemolysis rate of pristine PSF is about 0.78%, the hemolysis rate of PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB is 0.31%, 0.055% and -0.22%, respectively. The hemolysis rate of the zwitterion-containing membranes decreased compared with the PSF membrane. The presence of zwitterion led to its lower hemolysis rate, indicating that the modified zwitterion PSF membranes were blood-compatible and noncytotoxic.",114
208,"Pure water flux and rejection are the two important factors that determine the effectiveness and performance of UF membranes. Permeation performance of pure water was measured under a pressure of 0.1 MPa. As shown in Fig. 11, the PSF membrane has the lowest water flux (189.0 L*m-2*h-1) compared with the modified membranes. After the introduction of zwitterionic groups, the pure water flux of the PSF-PESSB50, PSF-PESSB67 and PESSB increased to 195.7, 214.0 and 229.7 L*m-2*h-1, respectively. As the ratio of the zwitterionic groups increased, the water flux of the modified membranes gradually increased by virtue of the elevated hydrophilicity. The rejection rate is related to the water treatment quality of the ultrafiltration membrane. The rejection rates of these membranes for BSA were all above 96%, indicating that the modification of the polymer has little effect on the rejection performance of the membrane.",142
209,"A series of copolymers (PSF-PESSB) were successfully synthesized by adjusting the proportion of the comonomers. Subsequently, the prepared zwitterion-containing polymers were introduced to prepare UF membranes. During the phase inversion, the zwitterion groups in the block polymer were induced to the surface of the membrane due to the hydrophilic properties. Compared with the PSF membranes, the PESSB membranes showed good properties including water permeability, fouling resistance and blood compatibility. It can be noted that few platelets and RBCs adhered to the zwitterion-containing membranes, and the shape of platelets and RBCs exhibited spherical morphologies with almost no pseudopod and deformation. Importantly, the flux recovery ratio of the PESSB membrane was as high as 95%, indicating that it possessed outstanding resistance to protein contamination. These results reflected that the zwitterionization modification of the polymer could potentially replace the expensive, complicated and environmentally unsafe methods of zwitterion chemical surface modification of membranes. Given that, this work provides the promising strategies for constructing selfanticlotting membranes for hemodialysis, antifouling surface and water treatment device.",169

212,"Polymeric membranes have gained an important place in chemical technology and, in particular, porous membranes are commonly used in micro and ultra-filtration [1]. While polymeric membranes represent the state-of-the-art in water and wastewater treatment, current membrane design and chemistries suffer from inherent shortcomings that hinder further widespread development of the related separation technologies [2]. Many of these weaknesses, related to fouling, separation performance, and chemical and mechanical resistance, can be overcome by progresses in materials science and technology.",78
213,"There are several ways to prepare porous polymeric membranes, but the majority of membranes are prepared by controlled phase separation of a polymer solution into two phases: one with high and one with a low polymer concentration. The concentrated phase solidifies shortly after phase separation, thus forming the membrane. The separation performance of membranes prepared by this process depends on the morphology formed during phase separation and subsequent solidification. The most common method to induce phase separation is via phase inversion using the non-solvent induced phase separation technique (NIPS) [3]. In this process, the polymer solution is cast as a thin film and is subsequently immersed in a non-solvent bath. Precipitation occurs because the good solvent in the polymer solution is exchanged for the non-solvent.",125
214,"Polymers such as polyvinilydene fluoride (PVDF) and polysulfone (PSU) have been widely used to prepare microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes because of their mechanical strength and their behavior under a relatively broad range of chemical and pH conditions [4]. However, PSU is not resistant to many aprotic solvents and therefore it is not suitable for nanofiltration processes where these solvents are used [5,6].",62
215,"To improve the solvent resistance as well as the mechanical performance of PSU-based membranes, a post-crosslinking process is often required. Electron-beam irradiation was proposed [7] which, however, requires expensive equipment and induces damage of the membrane structure during irradiation. Alternatively, UV-irradiation was adopted and mixtures of PSU and acrylic cross-linker were thus investigated [8,9]. In these works, acrylic cross-linkers and photoinitiators are added to the PSU casting solution. Both additives are chosen in such a way that they do not leach out from the polymer matrix to the non-solvent bath during the NIPS process. The formed membranes are then UV-irradiated after phase inversion. A different but more elegant approach could involve the incorporation of cross-linkable functionalities on the PSU-backbone. In general, the chemical incorporation of functional groups into PSUs can be achieved through two approaches, namely (i) by using functional co-monomers during polycondensation [10-14], and (ii) by post-synthesis modification [15-24].",150
216,"In this study, we propose a facile post-synthesis approach to incorporate methacrylic functionalities at the chain ends of PSU molecules. The attachment of such cross-linking sites essentially provides rapid curing while preserving the PSU properties. We report scalable fabrication of novel porous PSU network membranes by photoinduced cross-linking of the macromonomer. We investigate both phase inversion/UV-curing or UV-curing/phase inversion sequences. The cross-linked membranes are fully characterized and their viscoelastic properties, solvent stability, morphology, and flux performance are evaluated.",78

Firstly, hydroxyl functionalized PSU-2000, PSU-4000, and PSU-15000 were prepared by condensation polymerization according to the modified procedure described in the literature [25]. Hydroxyl terminated polysulfone oligomers with desired molecular weights were obtained by adjusting the monomer concentrations.

The reaction mixture was heated under reflux at 150degC for 4h with water removal. The reaction was stopped after about 2h and cooled to room temperature. The solution was filtered to remove most of the salts and poured into a mixture of methanol and water (4:1). The precipitated polymer was filtered, and washed several times with water in order to remove the remaining salts and impurities.

After obtaining homogenous solutions, a film of 100mm thickness was cast onto a glass plate. Membrane formation was initially induced by exposing the wet film to air for 60sec, thus forming a thin selective layer at the film surface. Subsequently, the film was subjected to either of two sequences, i.e., NIPS followed by UV curing (NIPS-UV) or UV curing followed by NIPS (UV-NIPS). NIPS was carried out in a coagulation bath, containing distilled water, for 24h. During the casting and phase separation, the temperature of air was 25+-3degC and its relative humidity was 40+-10%. The cross linking of modified PSU membranes was performed through UV curing, either after (NIPS-UV) or before (UV-NIPS) phase inversion.

The obtained membrane was irradiated and the acrylic double bond conversion was measured with ATR-FTIR collected before and after UV irradiation. A conversion of about 41% of acrylic double bonds was achieved after one minute of irradiation under nitrogen (Table 3). The limited acrylic double bond conversion could be attributed to a limited mobility in the PSU membrane (the Tg is around 178degC, in accordance with the data reported in literature for pristine PSU).",102

246,"Membrane technology has continued to offer competent and sustainable solutions for the preservation and recovery of water resources. In terms of the active treatment of challenging oily wastewater and associated emulsions, membrane technology provides diversity towards meeting specific needs of recovery operations, superior efficiency and convenient operationalization over other mechanical and chemical approaches such as flotation, coagulation, and centrifugation [1,2]. Significant efforts have been directed towards emulsified oily water as it is the hardest to eliminate. This is because the water contains oil droplets that are minute in size (<10 mm) and remain suspended in water due to surfactants [3]. Other types of oily wastewater such as floating oils and dispersed oils (relatively larger than 10 mm) easily coalesce and form large droplets that can be easily removed [4]. Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane technology has proved to be successful in removing emulsified droplets due to its operational modus that is largely dependent on size exclusion. However, this also presents its greatest hurdle; that is, fouling, has long been the focal motivation for numerous research activities seeking to alleviate it as it leads to deterioration in permeation and retention performance [1,5].",189
247,"Polymer blending modification is the most standard approach applied for improving membrane antifouling performance. The one-pot and mostly one-step technique is attractive for its simplicity. Generally, all that is required is to mix the desired materials having specific properties (polymer, solvent and additives) and the resulting membranes will exhibit the characteristics of the content materials [6]. Previously, our group designed ultrafiltration (UF) mixed matrix membranes by blending polyethersulfone (PES), and sulfonated polysulfone (SPSf) with incorporated small amounts of TiO2 NPs [7]. Findings from our work showed that the stable flat sheet membranes separated oil-in-water emulsions and maintained good permeation and performance. TiO2 NPs aided in the modification of the porosity and improved the hydrophilicity and mechanical strength of the MMMs. However, the UF MMMs were found to be appropriate only for the separation of emulsions containing oil droplet sizes >500 nm and the antifouling properties were observed to be short-lived. Rather than increase the content of TiO2 content in the membranes, which was found to expand the pore size and porosity of the membranes, we sought to improve the surface properties of PES/SPSf/ TiO2 membranes through coating.",187
248,"Other contributions to the synergistic interaction between organic and inorganic components cited by researchers are that inorganic elements in a hybrid layer prevent the rigid close-stacking of normally long-chained organic polymers. While the resulting 'loosening' of chain arrangement is advantageous for improving the permeation performance, the physical integrity of the composite layer is compromised and therefore requires to be stabilized via crosslinking on a membrane surface to prevent erosion and degradation during application [14]. For instance, Halakoo et al. [15] utilized glutaraldehyde (GA) to crosslink the layers of PEI with graphene oxide sheets while preparing pervaporation membranes. Elsewhere, Cao et al. [16] employed trimesoylchloride (TMC) to crosslink PEI and generate nanofiltration(NF) membranes for humic acid and dye removal. Liu et al.

251,"The PES/SPSf/TiO2 blend membranes used as the substrates were prepared using NIPS method where the optimum polymer blend ratio (PES/SPSf) was fixed at 84:16 with 24 % PEG additive as described in our previous work [7,19],. Polymer and additive composition for the substrates are described in Table 1. First, a 0.075 wt% TiO2 from a 2 wt% stock solution and a calculated amount of water were dispersed in DMAc through ultrasonication for 30 min. Then, PES, SPSf and PEG polymers were dissolved in DMAc and mixed with TiO2 NPs under continuous stirring at 50 +- 1 degC for 12 h to form homogenous casting solutions. After degasification at the same temperature, the solutions were cast onto a clean glass plate substrate using an automated membrane applicator (Elcometer 4340, England) with a casting knife set at 200 mm gap thickness and then immediately immersed in a deionized water bath (+-1 degC). The prepared membranes were stored in deionized water for 24 h before coating to ensure complete solvent removal.",168
252,"The bulk porosity of the PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs was calculated to be 82.4 +- 1.5 % using the dry-wet method (Eq. S1). Furthermore, utilizing results of the bulk porosity, the membrane bulk pore radius was estimated to be 43.7 +- 1.4 nm using the Guerout-Elford-Ferry equation (Eq. S2) as described in the Supplementary Information.",53
253,"Preliminary experiments were first conducted to determine the optimum concentration of PEI (0.025 wt%), volume and post-treatment parameters to use. This was followed by investigating the optimal crosslinking concentration for GA to utilize. Briefly, 10 mL of 0.025 wt% PEI was deposited onto a 16.6 cm2 PES/SPSf/TiO2 substrate sample under 0.09 MPa vacuum pressure. The coated membrane was then thoroughly rinsed with 100 mL of DI water. After rinsing, 10 mL of GA at different concentrations was deposited and allowed to crosslink with PEI at 50 degC for 45 min. Following this, the membrane was rinsed with DI water to remove unreacted groups and dried at 50 degC for 3 min as shown in Scheme 1. The membranes were then stored in pure water for later use. The compositions of the PEI/GA coating layer are listed in Table S1 as MG0- MG0.1 . Chemical group, morphology and performance characterization techniques were utilized to establish that the optimum crosslinking concentrations for PEI and GA were PEI 0.025 wt%:GA 0.05 wt% i.e. MG0.05.",171
254,"The hybrid layer was constructed by initially sonicating varying concentrations of TiO2 NPs dispersion (0.01-0.1 wt%) in optimal aqueous PEI solution for 1 h. 10 mL of the resulting PEI-TiO2/GA solution was deposited on the MMMs substrate using vacuum filtration. Following, 10 mL of optimum GA concentration (0.05 wt%) was used to crosslink the PEI-TiO2/GA layers at 50 degC for 45 min. Finally, the generated PEI-TiO2/GA@PES/SPSf/ TiO2 composite membranes were rinsed and dried as previously described. A breakdown of PEI-TiO2/GA and GA concentrations used to coat the membranes is described in Table 2. From Table S1, MG0.05 was renamed to M1 (0 wt% TiO2) . The rest of the PEI-TiO2/GA hybrid coated membranes with different concentrations of TiO2 NPs (0.01-0.1 wt%) were labeled M2-M6, respectively, as displayed in Table 2.",130
255,"The size and shape of the TiO2 NPs dispersion (Fig. S1) were determined by field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) (H7650, Hitachi, Japan). ImageJ(r) image processing software was used to determine the average size of the NPs which was found to be 19 nm.",44
256,"The water uptake technique was employed to examine the physical behavior of membranes in water, thereby showing the effect of coating and crosslinking the membranes. Membrane samples with a diameter of 20 mm were dried at 60 degC under vacuum for 12 h. The membranes were weighed and then soaked in DI water for 24 h to allow for complete sorption. Before re-weighing, the samples were lightly dabbed with blotting paper to eliminate water drops adhering to the surface. Computation of the water sorption (S) was determined using Eq.(1) as follows [20]:(1)S=Dii-DiDix100%where D(i) and D(ii) are respective dry and wet (after water uptake) weights of the membranes. The process was repeated three times and the average was computed.",118
257,"Raman spectrometry (Xplora PLUS, Horiba) was used to detect the presence of TiO2 NPs in PES/SPSf/TiO2 substrate polymer solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) was performed using GeminiSEM500 (Zeiss, Germany). SEM enabled the surface and cross-sectional observation of the morphology of freeze fractured and gold sprayed membrane samples while EDX was utilized for the elemental mapping assessment in the layer on the surface and cross-section of the membrane samples. Interpretation of mapping data was performed utilizing EDAX TEAM (tm) software. Additional imaging analysis and elemental mapping were conducted via field emission high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (FE-HRTEM) (JEM-F200, JEC, Japan). The HR-TEM samples were ultra-thin membrane layer sections prepared on an EM EC7/FC7 ultra-microtome precision slicing equipment (Leica, Germany) stabilized in resin.",125
258,"For the analysis of functional groups in the membranes, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR) (Nicolet(tm) iS50, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (K-alpha, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were utilized. Surface zeta potential was characterized by SURPASS-3 (Anton Paar, Austria) while the pore sizes of the substrate and coated membranes were calculated via the MWCO method using different molecular weights of PEG solutions (100 mg/L). After establishing the corresponding MWCO at 90 % retention rates for each membrane, the relationship between the corresponding PEG molecular weight and pore size was correlated using Eq.(2)[21] as follows:(2)d=0.09Mw0.44where, d is the size of the pore in nanometres (nm) and Mw is the PEG molecular weight in Daltons.",117
259,"Thermal measurements of membrane samples of a specific area and weight were taken at a 10 degC/min heating rate under nitrogen gas using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (TG209F3 Tarsus, NETZSCH, Germany). Hydrophilic properties of the membranes were determined in two ways: air/WCA and UWOCA by Kruss Drop Shape Analyzer (DSA25, Germany). Vacuum dried membranes were mounted onto a microscope glass slide and a water droplet (2 mL) was dripped onto the membrane surface. The air/WCA was measured at a static state. For UWOCA, four different types of oils (gasoline, hexane PE and DCM) were made to contact the surface of mounted membrane samples immersed in water.",105
260,"Membrane filtration performance was carried out using a laboratory cross-flow filtration construct as illustrated in Scheme 2. The pump, 0-10 bar pressure gauges, flow meter and valves were supplied by Shanghai Jiaxing pumps Co. Ltd., (China). A recirculating water chiller, Model number: DLSB-4/15, from Zhengzhou Keda Machinery and Instrument Equipment Co. Ltd., (China) was used to maintain the feed at room temperature. A custom made stainless steel membrane cell with an area of 7.07 cm2 (diameter = 3 cm) was connected in cross-flow mode between the feed tank and the permeate collection point as demonstrated in Scheme 2. To collect data, compaction was first conducted for 90 min at 0.3 MPa. After stabilization, the pressure was reduced to 0.25 MPa and the water permeance was recorded in L/m2 h (LMH) bar-1 as JwI using Eq.(3) as follows:(3)Jw1=VADtPwhere V is the permeate volume (L), A is the operative membrane area (m2), Dt is the filtration time (h) and DP is the applied pressure (bar).",163
261,"Different oil-in-water emulsion feeds were prepared by adding the mass ratio of the oils (gasoline, hexane, pet. Ether and dichloromethane) to SDS surfactant 9:1 at 100 ppm aqueous solution. Mixing was conducted at 900 rpm for 12 h [22]. Emulsion droplet sizes were characterized using Litesizer(tm) 500 (Anton Paar, Austria) particle analyzer based on weighted number frequency. The assessment of the efficiency of the membranes to remove oil from the feed solution was determined based on the total organic carbon (TOC) Eq.(4):(4)R%=1-TpTfx100where, R is the observed rejection of the membrane, Tp is the TOC in the permeate and Tf is the TOC of the feed. The oil concentration in the feed and permeate samples were determined using TOC Analyzer NDIR Method Model, Shimadzu (Japan). Feed and permeate samples were diluted up to 1000 times before being fed into the analyzer.",140
262,"Antifouling assessment was conducted using an 'on-off' method for the system with the highest oil concentration. A membrane was first used in the pure water filtration system and then transferred to the filtration set-up where fouling occurred. After each emulsion filtration phase, the fouled membrane was cleaned with deionized water. Subsequently, the PWP of the 'clean' membranes was calculated using Eq.(3) and denoted as Jw2. The entire process encompassed two cycles in five phases for a total of 300 min. One cycle included a pure water filtration phase and an emulsion separation phase and a cleaning step.",97
263,"Two aspects were used to describe the antifouling properties: the permeance decline ratio (PDR) and the permeance recovery rate (PRR). PDRtot denotes the total fouling on a membrane during each emulsion filtration phase and was calculated via Eq.(5):(5)PDRtot%=1-JfJw1x100where, Jf is the feed permeance (LMH bar-1) at phase II (the first emulsion filtration phase).",53
264,"To further assess the PDRt, reversible permeance decline (PDRr) and irreversible permeance decline (PDRirr) they were calculated using the following eqs. [7]:(6)PDRr=Jw2III-JfJw1x100(7)PDRirr=Jw1-Jw2IIIJw1x100where, Jw2III is the pure water permeance at phase III.",31
265,While PRR is computed as the pure water permeance of the membranes before fouling and after the fouling process i.e. recovery after the total fouling ratio of the experiment. The PRR (%) was determined using Eq.(8) after the phase V.(8)PRR%=Jw2VJw1x100where Jw2V is the pure water permeance at phase V.,49
266,"Functional group analysis helps to understand the physicochemical properties of the surface coatings and confirms the success of the methods used to fabricate membranes. Fig. 1 shows comparative FT-IR spectral characteristics of the substrate (M0) and the composite membranes. Bulk polymer groups of M0 are represented by -CH, -SO3 and -SO2 at 2856 cm-1 & 2944 cm-1, 1082 cm-1 and 1103 cm-1, respectively [23]. A small absorption bend at 1646 cm-1 is ascribed to Ti-OH bonds, resulting from adsorbed water on TiO2 NPs. It confirms the incorporation of TiO2 NPs in the matrix [7].",94
267,"Additional qualitative and quantitative evaluation of functional groups of the coated membranes was conducted using XPS as presented in Fig. 2. Overall spectra in Fig. 2(a) shows the presence of C 1 s at 285 eV, O 1 s at 532 eV and S 2p at 167.5 eV for all membranes. Further, N 1 s at 398.8 eV observed is ascribed to the presence of PEI in PEI/GA and PEI-TiO2/GA hybrid layer [3]. A general peak demonstrating Ti 2p is observed at ~457.3 eV for PEI-TiO2/GA layer confirming the presence and immobilization of TiO2 NPs on the surface of MMMs (Fig. 2 (a)). Since no obvious Ti peak was observed in the substrate's XPS spectrum due to its low concentration within the bulk membrane matrix, Raman spectroscopy analysis was used to determine the presence of the NPs in the UF MMM substrate (M0). As shown in Fig. S2, a peak at 517 cm-1 characteristic of TiO bonds appeared in PES/SPSf/TiO2 UF MMM (M0) [7].",164
268,"The deconvoluted N 1 s peaks of M1 and M3 (Fig. 2 (b) and (c)) were utilized to elaborate the functional groups of the composite membranes (M1 and M3) and further confirm the formation of the surface coating on the MMMs. The XPS data corroborate the results found in FT-IR. First, in Fig. 2 (b), PEI/GA@MMM (M1) containing crosslinked -NH2 groups are detected at 400.2 eV. CN, NH and bridging N atoms are also detected at 398.8 eV [29]. Then upon the integration of TiO2 NPs, the amine groups underwent protonation and were detected at 401.1 eV as demonstrated in Fig. 2 (c) [30]. TiO2 2p peak in M3 was identified at 458.3 eV and 463.8 eV [31] (Fig. 2 (d)). Moreover, atomic quantities of the elements supporting the above deductions are listed in Table 3. M3 has a lower amount of nitrogen because the amine groups first interact with TiO2 through hydrogen bonding and then undergo aldol condensation with GA groups, therefore there are fewer free amine groups in M3. Additionally, TiO2 NPs impart the hybrid coating with a high content of oxygen, which is beneficial towards increasing the hydrophilicity of the composite membrane.",195
269,"Ti-OH groups arising from adsorbed water molecules on TiO2 NPs facilitated the interaction of the NPs with both PEI and GA as shown in Fig. 4. First, the protonation of amines resulted in hydrogen bonding interactions with TiO2. GA then reacted with free amine groups and with TiO2 NPs through aldimine condensation and nucleophilic addition respectively. Though the interactions between GA and PEI are decreased owing to the presence of TiO2 NPs, the additional hydrogen bonding interactions between the molecules enhance stability and cohesiveness [33]. FT-IR spectra in Fig. 5 illustrates the difference in the band shifts between M1 and M3. M3 spectrum shows a peak at 1542 cm-1 representing the protonated amines. Ti-OH bonds are indicated at 1644 cm-1 and finally, unreacted carbonyl centers at 1717 cm-1[26]. According to Table S2 water uptake rates of M3 (PEI-TiO2 (0.025)/GA@MMM) were much higher than M1 (PEI/GA@MMM) indicating a loosely crosslinked structure.. Conclusively, TiO2 was successfully integrated with PEI and aided in the formation of a loosely crosslinked but stable byrid layer by further interacting with GA through hydrogen bonding.",178
270,"To further support imaging analysis, EDX elemental mapping analysis was conducted on the surfaces of the membranes as shown in Fig. S5. A general overlay combined with the mapping of three core elements is presented. For M1 and M2, N serves as the guiding element illustrating the distribution of coated materials as well as changes brought about by the crosslinking reaction. It can be seen in Fig. S5 that N is clustered in M1 confirming the crosslinked structures observed in SEM. Against a backdrop of O, Ti in M3 is specifically observed to appear in the areas where there is N [36]. Overall, the coatings were homogeneously distributed in all membranes.",111
271,"Referring to Fig. 4, TiO2 plays a role in the interruption and arrangement of crosslinked chains in the layer network. The NPs bind with amine groups of PEI breaking the compact buildup of moieties when reacted with GA. Furthermore, the carbonyl centers of a,b unsaturated glutaraldehyde can interact with TiO2 NPs through hydrogen bonding ensuring a stable hybrid layer. The better the distribution of TiO2, the more improved the interconnection and organization between the molecules resulting in a homogenously distributed thin layer for as seen in M2, M3 and M4. Heaped layers of high TiO2 loadings accounted for the increased layer thicknesses as exhibited in SEM images M5 and M6 as shown in Fig. 6 and EDX images in Fig. S6. The regulation of a coating thickness is desirable for membrane filtration performance as it must not compromise the selectivity of the resulting composite membrane [37].",146
272,"Fig. 7 demonstrates the MWCO of the substrate and modified membranes determined from the filtration of 2, 6,10,20, 40, 100 and 300 kDa PEG solutions (100 mg/L). According to the MWCO assessment, the all the membranes are in the ultrafiltration range albeit at different degrees. A high crosslinking degree in M1 caused the membrane to have a low MWCO at 8.5 kDa. It implies that the membrane will have a high selectivity during filtration. Under membrane filtration classification, M1 falls well within the tight ultrafiltration (TUF) category at an average pore size of 4.5 nm. TUF membranes have been extensively used for the separation of dyes, organic solutes and some salts at low pressures [4]. In a word, the MWCO assessment of the composite membranes is in agreement with the morphology and formation mechanism analysis.",135
273,"It is also found from Fig. 7 that as the concentration of TiO2 NPs increases in the hybrid layer, the coated membranes show increasing MWCO i.e. M2 = 15 kDa (6.3 nm), M3 = 27 kDa (8.0 nm), M4 = 35 kDa (9.1 nm), M5 = 38 kDa (9.4 nm) and M6 = 40 kDa (9.6 nm). The changes in MWCO are accredited to the inter-chain spaces, which would improve mass transport, as observed in the surface imaging results (Fig. 6). According to our previous study, the resultant PES/SPS/TiO2 UF MMMs displayed poor separation performance for oil-in-water emulsions containing droplets <500 nm owing to the large pore size [7]. Herein, a pore size of ~10 nm for a hybrid coating should be optimal for the removal of nano-sized oil droplets of <=100 nm as reported in the literature [12].",139
274,"In general, the surface modification method is suitable for generating tunable surface charges. Surface charge of the UF substrate and surface coated membranes is demonstrated in Fig. 9. The zeta potential of M0 displays a high negative charge density around -33.0 +- 2.9 mV, which originates from a certain amount of SPSf with -SO3- groups in M0. Interestingly, the zeta potential of M1 exhibits a positive charge of around +1.3 +- 0.4 mV. This demonstrates the charge reversing ability of PEI owing to its high NH2 content [30]. It is noted that the isoelectric point of 0.025 wt% PEI was measured and found to be 10.94 before the vacuum-assisted deposition was performed. After crosslinking with 0.05 wt% GA, a near-zero surface charge is obtained confirming the consumption of NH2 groups during the aldimine condensation reaction. Other research has found similar tendencies after chemically crosslinking PEI with appropriate amounts of cross-linker [39,40].",151
275,"It also can be seen from Fig. 9 that the zeta potential of the composite membranes is quickly altered and grows in electronegativity by the addition of TiO2 NPs. In addition, the zeta potential of the composite membranes gradually changed from -2.9 +- 0.8 mV to -17.3 +- 1.5 mV with the increase of TiO2 NPs content from 0.01 wt% (M2) to 0.1 wt% (M6) in the hybrid layer .It is well known that the surface charge of a membrane determines the interaction of the membrane surface and foulant, ultimately affecting its separation performance, except size exclusion. Electro-neutrality in a membrane is uniquely beneficial for the fractionation of charged solutes having different sizes, because separation will be dependent on the size exclusion mechanism [40]. However, the majority of organic compounds in water, such as humic acids, have an overall negative charge. The lack of charge on a membrane surface hampers its repelling ability, which influences antifouling. Alternatively, a negatively charged membrane is beneficial for repelling foulants having negative charge, such as oil droplets distant from the membrane surface [5,41].",179
276,"Additionally, WCA and UWOCA tests using gasoline were used to demonstrate the wettability properties of the composite membranes in an air environment as shown in Fig. 10. Distinctly, the UF MMM substrate and composite membranes can be defined as hydrophilic since all the WCAs are below 90deg [6]. Among of them, M1 has the highest WCA of 63deg compared with the other membranes, which derives from the minimal charge on the membrane surface. From zeta potential analysis, M1 with a very low surface charge indicates the lack of charged functional groups on the surface contrary to the surface charge of M0 and the PEI-TiO2/GA composite membranes [40]. In addition, the tightly packed and dense PEI-GA network impede the penetration of water molecules, whereas the more loosely packed chains of PEI-TiO2/GA hybrid hydrophilic layer on the MMMs readily allow water transport.",140
277,"It has been well established that membrane surfaces with low WCAs demonstrate increased resistance to oil adhesion in the presence of water. UWOCA predicts the interaction of oil droplets with the membranes and simulates the interaction during filtration and therefore antifouling characteristics. A membrane with ideal UWOCA properties usually displays high antifouling performance [41,42]. As shown in Fig. 10, all the PEI-TiO2/GA composite membranes possess very high underwater oleophobicity i.e. > 160deg, such as M2 = 163deg, M3 = 167deg M4 = 169deg, M5 = 166deg and M6 = 164deg. In water, hydroxy groups endowed water molecules adsorbed on TiO2 NPs contribute to the interaction with water molecules to form a protective hydration layer on the membrane surface, thereby increasing resistance to oil adhesion. As such for M0, some oil molecules were able to penetrate through the membrane because the surface lacked sufficient hydrophilic groups to form a robust oil repelling hydration layer [11,13,17].",154
278,"Prior to determining the retention performance of the membranes for emulsion separation, it was found that the average oil droplet size of gasoline oil-in-water emulsion was 115 +- 1.9 nm as illustrated in Fig. S7 (b). As anticipated, M1 composite membrane with a 4.8 nm pore size demonstrated the highest retention of the nano-emulsion at 97.6 % as shown in Fig. 11(b). Further, the oil rejection of the composite membranes progressively decreased from 96.5 % (M2) to 95.3 % (M3), 88.8 % (M4), 84.3 % (M5) and 81.6 % (M6). Evidently, the increasing pore sizes of the PEI-TiO2/GA composite membranes displayed classic trade-off performance.",104
279,"It is notable from the separation performance in Fig. 12 (a) that DCM shows less retention for M0 (50.1 %) and M3 (91.0 %), despite the fact that the DCM oil-in-water emulsion has a larger oil droplet size of 255 nm (Fig.S11 (c)). This is because DCM contains polar groups, unlike gasoline, hexane, and PE, allowing partial DCM miscibility with water. Consequently, while under water, DCM droplets adsorb on the negatively charged membrane surface to a certain extent. This tendency is demonstrated in the wetting analysis using UWOCA of DCM with M0 (74deg) and M3 (135deg) in Fig. 12 (b) whereas M1 is 145deg. It has been demonstrated that an effective way to remedy the wettability of a membrane surface against polar and nonpolar oils is to endow the membrane with hydroxy groups, thereby imparting underwater super-oleophobicity [20].",138
280,"Membrane fouling by oils during filtration has been identified to be different from other types of foulants, which fit into conventional mechanisms classified by Hermia [46]: standard, partial and complete pore blocking, and cake formation. Although the eventual outcome of fouling by oil is cake formation, oil droplet fouling has been described to be different from the aforementioned models as the oil emulsions deform, coalesce or split into smaller droplets under pressure [5,41]. Interaction of oil droplets with the membrane surface and pores is predicated on the inherent properties of the membrane, specifically morphology, hydrophilicity and pore properties. The membrane materials and fabrication technique hence come into play to tailor these properties. Experimental observations have consistently shown that increased membrane surface hydrophilicity enhances its antifouling properties towards oil emulsion feeds [6,9,47]. Scheme 3 summarizes the filtration performance mechanism of the composite membranes.",142
281,"The PDR tot describes the rate at which foulants accumulate on the membrane after each emulsion phase in the cycle. Following, PDRr represents the rate at which foulants physically adsorb at the surface of the membrane during filtration. PDRr (reversible fouling) is characteristic of cake layer formation and can be removed via simple cleaning or rinsing action. Of higher significance to the interpretation of antifouling performance is the PDR irr, which represents the rate at which the membrane is unable to regenerate its prior performance after cleaning. Unlike with reversible fouling, there is a chemical interaction between the foulants and the membrane surface hence rendering the applied form of cleaning redundant. Rather than propose harsh techniques to remove this type of fouling on a membrane during operation, it is more valuable to researchers to improve the design of the membrane to impede the rate of chemical interaction with the foulants. Therein the significance of incorporating hydrophilic elements that impart a hydration layer that shield membrane surfaces against oil adhesion [44,47].",170
282,"In Fig. 13(c) and (d) M3 has the lowest PDR irr in both instances with 5.2 % for gasoline and 11.3 % for dichloromethane while that of M1 is calculated to be 14.5 % and 22.6 %, respectively. Additionally, despite having a lower UWOCA with DCM than gasoline, the antifouling performance of M3 after filtration of DCM was the best in comparison to M0 and M1, as evidenced by a PRR of 82.7 %. M3 also shows the best performance in antifouling characteristics for gasoline with a PRR of 91.4 %, which is double that of M1 (45%) and which compares favorably with current research data, as shown in Table 4. To further support the robust antifouling ability, the air/WCA was measured after the composite membranes underwent PWP in phase V. The contact angle of the M0 (58deg) after filtration and cleaning with gasoline oil-in-water increased to 104deg and 98deg, while that of M3 (42 deg) remained relatively stable at 50deg and 57deg for gasoline and DCM respectively.",168

287,"The sustainable supply of clean water and energy are among the top global challenges of the 21st century and are necessary due to increasing human population size, industrialization, and global climate change [1,2]. Given the growing scarcity of water and low quality of potable water, research has focused on identifying new techniques for water treatment [3].",56
288,"Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes have become particularly important in wastewater treatment as they operate under low pressure. In particular, high permeate flux UF membranes have been extensively studied with a focus on polymeric membranes because the pore-formation is easily engineered, and the fabrication is straightforward. Further, the production of polymeric membranes is simple to scale up at affordable capital, requires smaller spaces for installation, and operation costs are low [4]. Ultrafiltration membranes are also used in dialysis, membrane distillation, forward osmosis, and osmotic membrane crystallization[45]. Despite their vast applications, the performance of UF membranes is affected by membrane fouling and wetting. Membrane fouling significantly reduces water permeation, causing increased energy consumption and elevated operating costs [6].",115
289,"Several attempts have been made by researchers to make immiscible polymers compatible in blended systems. For example, Rana et al. studied the miscibility of poly (ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) and poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate) (SBA) using thermogravimetric analysis and determining parameters for the interaction between the monomer residues ST-BA and EMA-BA. The miscibility window at the temperatures (225 and 185 degC) was utilized to define the thermodynamic interaction parameters between monomer residues contained in the component polymers of the blends using mean-field theory [11]. In another study, the beneficial use of a third polymer that contains miscible or similar components with the two polymers of interest, as a compatibilizer functioning as a surfactant was demonstrated [12]. Ferrarezi et al. described how to fabricate a poly (lactic acid) (PLA)/thermoplastic starch (TPS) blend utilizing poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), which was a non-toxic polymer used as a compatibilizer. In their study, the effect of PEGs on the shape and characteristics of PLA/TPS blends was investigated[12]. The use of PEG in membrane fabrication has since become popular, and investigations have focused on its effect on the morphology, pore formation, and performance of UF membranes.",188
290,"As mentioned above, PSF is a conventional polymeric membrane material that has demonstrated several advantages. However, its hydrophobicity makes it susceptible to fouling, which remains the primary limiting concern for its efficient application. Poly (ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) copolymer (EVOH) is a potential hydrophilic organic copolymer [13]. Membranes prepared from EVOH have attracted the interest of researchers from disciplines such as biomedical, food, fuel cells, and water treatment due to their chemical resistance, superior permeability properties, and high hydrophilicity[14]. Cui and colleagues [6] evaluated the effect of blending PVDF with EVOH on membrane characteristics and performance. However, the low content of EVOH used in that study resulted in poor compatibility between PVDF and EVOH[6]. Still, minimal work has been done on blending EVOH with other polymers for water treatment applications because the abundance of aliphatic hydroxyl groups would cause poor miscibility with other polymers [15]. Conversely, the abundance of hydroxyl groups enables hydrogen bonding in a blend. Therefore, the presence of additional functional groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding interactions may form miscible blends [16].",174
291,"Several methods have been developed for predicting compatibility between two or more polymers. The method of solubility parameters is frequently used to predict the compatibility of polymer blends because of its simplicity and involves comparing values for solubility. For example, Ron et al. compared the solubility parameters of various solvents and reported increasedmiscibility forhomopolymer copolymer system - poly (phenyl acrylate) (PPA) and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) blend when particular solvents (e.g acetonitrile) were used for dissolution of the blend. Thiseffectof increased miscibility was attributed to the solvent's degree of interaction between the two polymers [17]. In relation to this principle, the solubility parameters (d) of PSF (9.63 (cal/cm3)1/2) [9] and EVOH32 (11.05 (cal/cm3)1/2) [15] are dissimilar, suggesting poor miscibility. To achieve good miscibility, two polymers must have similar solubility parameters, indicating favorable physical affinity [18] and/ or addition of any third polymer that is miscible with two others e.g. (d) PEG (10.26 (cal/cm3)1/2) [19].",152
292,"Most early studies and current work in membrane technology for water treatment have almost exclusively focused on using PEG as a pore generating agent, membrane morphology control, and performance enhancement [20,21]. However, few studies have investigated how to better leverage PEG to enhance miscibility and fabricate UF membranes with hydrophilicity and antifouling properties for water purification. Additional research in the blending of polymers for water purification is needed to fully grasp the detailed undeveloped aspects of EVOH, which might be aided using PEG. No research has explored PSF/EVOH blend membrane synthesis, membrane formation process, or membrane performance.",97
293,"The objective of the current study was to use PEG as a hydrophilic additive, pore-forming agent, and compatibilizer to tailor the compatibility and hydrophilicity of a PSF/EVOH blend membrane using non-solvent phase separation (NIPS). In this study, EVOH was used as a porosity and hydrophilicity enhancer in a PSF UF membrane. The compatibility between PSF and EVOH32 was first studied through visual observation and viscosity at increasing shear rates in the absence of PEG 20 kDa. Specifically, classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to model the interactions between PSF, EVOH32, and PEG. Radial distribution functions were then calculated. The miscibility between PSF and EVOH32 was verified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The same membrane compositions were then fabricated in the presence of PEG 20 kDa. Fabricated membranes were evaluated for compatibility, morphology properties such as pore size, porosity, hydrophobicity, performance (water permeance, BSA rejection, and antifouling), and mechanical properties.",151
294,"The PSF (Mw = 35,000 g/mol, Udel(r) P-3500) was supplied by Solvay Advanced Polymers Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China), EVOH32 (ethylene content of 32%) was procured from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, USA), and PEG 20 kDa (Mw = 20,000 g/mol) was provided by Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent. Dimethyl acetamide (DMAC) was sourced from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co. (Tianjin, China), and BSA Mw= ~ 68 kDa was procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, USA).",74
295,"In the PSF and EVOH32 blend casting solutions, the polymer concentration was kept at 20 wt% in DMAC. The membranes were fabricated using the non-solvent immersion precipitation method where measured amounts of PSF, EVOH32, and PEG 20 kDa were dissolved in DMAc at 70@C, whilst being briskly stirred for 12 h to acquire homogeneous casting solutions (Scheme 1). Casting solutions were allowed to stand for 6-8 h for degassing, then homogeneously spread on a glass plate using automated equipment (Elcometer 4340) with a casting film applicator set at the height of 200 um. The glass plate was then submerged into a coagulation water bath of deionized (DI) water at 25 degC. The subsequent membranes were then rinsed with deionized water until the pH value reached 7. The membranes were then immersed in DI water in a plastic container for storage until use.",142
296,"Table 1 illustrates the composition of the casting solutions. Varying EVOH32 ratios from 0 to 85.15 wt% with and without PEG are labelled M0b-M3b. The ""b"" indicates membranes without PEG. Membranes with PEG are labelled M0-M3. M0 denotes the bare PSF membrane without EVOH32. Furthermore, the membranes with increasing concentrations of PEG ranging from 0 to 24 wt% at the same PSF/EVOH32 ratio, are labelled as M2-4 to M2-12.",69
297,"Successful modification of a hydrophobic polymer through blending with a hydrophilic polymer is generally influenced by the compatibility between the polymers under study. The compatibility can be predicted by the mixing free energy (DGm) [6]. In this study, the Schneier theory was used to explore the compatibility of the proposed blended system [18]. Schneier suggested that compatibility can be estimated by calculating the DHm following the Flory-Huggins theory. These parameters are listed in Table 2. The Schneier theory suggests that the critical value of mixing enthalpy (DHm) favours the miscibility of the two polymers due to DGm decrease [25]. If DHm <= 10 x 10 -3 cal/ mol-1, the blend composition is considered compatible. If DHm >= 10 x 10 -3 cal/ mol-1, the blend composition is considered incompatible.",129
298,"In the case of two polymeric blend systems, DHm can be calculated using Equation (1):(1)DHm=X1M1r1d1-d22X2(1-X2)M2r2+(1-X1)M1r121/2",15
299,"where DHm is the enthalpy of mixing (cal/l), X1 and X2 is the mass fraction for polymer 1 (PSF in this study) and polymer 2 (EVOH32 in this study), and should equal one when added together (X1 + X2 = 1). M is the molecular weight of the repeating units (g/l), d is the solubility parameter of the polymer (cal/cm3), and r is the polymer density (g/mL).",67
300,"Simulations were undertaken to understand the interactions between PEG, PSF, and EVOH32, using the Forcite Module in Materials Studio 8.0 [22]. The simulation was performed on four structures using periodic boundary terms in x- and y- dimensions and a frame size of 21 nm3. Calculations used an integration time step of 1 fs. These structures were optimized using a compressed-phased optimized molecular potential for atomistic simulation studies force field. An equilibrium state for each sample was achieved with zero pressure for 30 ns using the NPT ensemble at a constant temperature of 300 K. The electrostatic has been described using PPPM. Geometric optimizing was used to obtain the molecular equilibration systems of the pure separation membrane. The Berendsen barostat algorithm and the Andersen feedback thermostat were applied for the temperature and pressure conversion to determine the properties of the structures during the last 3000 ps. The probability of molecules occurring at the distance (r) was given by the radial distribution functions (RDFs), g(r).",163
301,"The rheological characteristics of the casting solutions were evaluated with a digital rotational viscometer (NDJ-8S, Hengping Instrument Company, Shanghai, China) at various temperatures and a shear rate of 10 s-1.",30
302,"A digital micrometer was used to determine the membrane thicknesses, and porosity was assessed using the gravimetric technique. The gravimetric technique entails cutting membrane coupons of a measured size (length, width, and thickness) then drying them in an oven at 50 degC to remove water. The dry membrane was first weighed and recorded as the dry weight (Wd). It was then immersed in 60 ml of DI water for 24 h to allow water absorption equilibrium. Following that, the wet membranes were gently patted dry between two filter papers. The remaining water drops were removed using clean, lint-free wipes. The membranes were then weighed again and recorded as the wet weight (Ww). The reported measurements were an average value of the three replicates. Furthermore, the wet and dry membrane weights were used for determining the overall porosity.",137

307,"Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC204F1, Germany) was used to determine the compatibility of the polymer blend using a glass transition temperature (Tm) of the blended membranes. Approximately 5 mg of the membrane was weighed and sealed in an aluminum pan. The temperature range was set at 40-250 degC in a nitrogen environment (20 ml min-1), with a heating rate of 10 degC min-1. Each sample was analyzed three times, and the average was reported. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was determined from the change in the slope of the DSC plot. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (STA409 PC, Netzssch) was used to study the thermal behaviours of the blended membranes. Approximately 8-12 mg of the sample was placed in a hermetical aluminum pan and heated from 25*C to 700*C at a heating rate of 10 degC min-1 in a nitrogen atmosphere.",139
308,"The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR) (Nicolet(tm) iS50, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to study the surface functional group moieties on the dried membrane samples. The FTIR spectra were recorded at a wavelength range of 400-4000 cm-1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) K-Alpha, from Thermo Fisher, was used to characterize the compositions of the chemicals on the blend membrane surfaces to observe the segregation of EVHO32 in PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes. Al Ka (1486.6 eV) was used as a radiation source. The survey spectrum was collected across the range of 0-1350 eV and included high-resolution C 1 s spectra.",100
309,"The surface, bottom, and cross-section (broken in liquid nitrogen) morphologies of the blend membrane were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, HITACHI, Japan). Further imaging was performed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 120 kV. A Leica ultra-microtome was used to obtain thin sections of approx. 100 nm. The membrane samples of approx. 100 um in thickness were fixed with epoxy resin. Finally, 100 nm-sized ultrathin fragments were fixed on a copper grid for image analysis.",82
310,"The hydrophilic nature of the blends was characterized by measuring Dynamic and static contact angles using a precision instrument Kruss Drop Shape Analyzer-DSA25 (Germany), in the sessile-drop mode at 25 degC. The method involves placing a drop of approximately 2 mL of deionized water onto the dried membrane surface and recording the contact angles using a camera for 100 s. The contact angles were conducted five times, and an average was obtained.",72
311,"A tensile testing machine (Hengyu Co., Ltd, China) was used to determine the tensile properties of the membranes. Pieces of vacuum-dried membranes, 5 x 5 mm in size, were placed on the membrane holder, and recordings were obtained at a speed of approx. 0.5 cm*min-1. Five samples were measured for all membranes, and an average calculated.",56
312,"The performance of the prepared membranes was evaluated using pure water permeance (PWP) and BSA rejection using a benchtop laboratory assembled crossflow system. Membrane coupons were cut into circles with an area of 7.0695 cm2 to fit in the filtration cell. Firstly, the membranes were compacted by allowing water to pass through for about 1 h at an applied pressure of 1.5 (bar). The pressure was then decreased to 1 bar for measuring the water flow rate. This value was then used to calculate the pure water permeance Pw1 (L.m-2h-1 bar-1) using Equation (4):(4)Pw1=VADtDP",94
313,"where Pw1 is the pure water permeance, V (L) is the volume of the water collected, A (m2) is the area of the tested membrane, Dt (h) is the operation time, and DP is the pressure (bar).

314,"Where, Cp and Cf represent the BSA concentration in the permeate and feed solutions, respectively, and were measured by spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 280 nm. The feed solution concentration was kept at 1 g L-1.",36
315,"For the antifouling studies, a BSA solution was used as a feed solution prepared at 1 g L-1. Each membrane was compacted for one hour, and the pure water permeance, Jw1, was first measured at 1 bar according to Equation (4) above. The filtration cell was then emptied and refilled with a BSA feed solution. The BSA foulant solution was recorded for one hour as Jp every 10 min.

318,where Jw2VII is the pure water permeance at the final stage VII.,12
319,"The Schneier theory Eq. (1) was used to predict the compatibility between PSF and EVOH32. According to the Flory-Huggins theory, the critical value of mixing enthalpy (DHm) for the thermally stable phase is 10 x 10-3 cal mol-1, corresponding to DGm = 0. That is if DHm < 10 x 10-3 cal mol-1, then the two polymers in question are compatible [18]. There is a distinct difference between the solubility parameters (d) of PSF (19.02 (MPa)1/2) [9] and EVOH (22.6 (MPa)1/2) [15], suggesting a weak interaction between the two polymers. Fig. 1 shows the DHm values of the PSF/EVOH32 blends, where the dotted line represents the critical boundary point between compatibility and incompatibility of the polymers as suggested by the Schneier theory [9,18]. The region above the dotted line corresponds to an incompatible ratio, while the region below the line represents the compatible ratio. As shown in Fig. 1, the critical value of mixing enthalpy DHm is more than 10.0 x 10-3cal mol-1 for PSF/EVOH32 at all mass ratios evaluated, suggesting the proposed polymer blend system is incompatible.",178
320,"The visual evaluations used in this study to corroborate the MD simulations as a first experimental indicator that the miscibility of PSF/EVOH32 blends may be improved by the addition of PEG are shown in Fig. 3(a-d). Usually, two polymers are considered ""compatible"" if they can be dissolved in a common solvent and form a one-phase system. Fig. 3(a-c) and S2 show digital photos of freshly prepared, stored (room temperature for four weeks), and reheated PSF/EVOH32 (90/10 wt%)/PEG solution (M2). The phase separation phenomenon was not observed, as displayed in Fig. 3(b-c), suggesting solutions with PEG were stable. This was attributed to the hydrogen bonding between PEG and PSF/EVOH32 polymer chains. However, the PSF/EVOH32 (90/10 wt%) system (M2b) Fig. 3(d) displayed two distinct phase regions with a distinct boundary, implying poor compatibility between the polymers. Consequently, the images indicate good miscibility of PSF/EVOH32 (90/10 wt%)/PEG as the solution was homogenous and showed no distinct phase separation, even over long-term storage [5]. The visual observations are consistent with the conclusions from MD simulations.",171
321,"Additionally, the effect of adding PEG on the characteristics of the PSF/EVOH32 casting solution was investigated by measuring viscosity at increasing temperatures, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The viscosity of PSF/EVOH32/PEG (22 wt%) solutions with different blend ratios of PSF/EVOH32 (100/0, 95/5 90/10, and 85/15 wt%) decreased with an increase in temperature. This phenomenon is related to the electrostatic repulsion of the polymer chains in solution, resulting in a more stretched macro conformation with reduced chain entanglement [28]. As seen in Fig. 4(b), the viscosity of the casting solution increased linearly with the increasing EVOH concentration at the same temperature (56 degC). This further suggests that the full miscibility of the PSF/EVOH32/PEG blend [28,29] is attributed to the increased hydrophilic polymer. The presence of the hydroxyl groups significantly influenced this trend as they were responsible for the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the casting solutions with the assistance of PEG [30]. The increased hydrogen bonding between PSF, EVOH32, and PEG in the blend was expected based on the MD interpretation presented in Fig. 2(b). In addition, the data reflects that upon the increase of EVOH32 content from 0% to 15%, the stability of the casting solutions was maintained.",199
322,"Further, the observation of a single Tm in the DSC scan shown in Fig. 5(a), and a similar decomposition TGA pattern in Fig. S6 is further proof that the mixed polymers (PSF/EVOH32) are miscible in the presence of PEG [8,31]. More than one phase transition indicates the formation of different phases within the inner structure, which suggests polymer immiscibility. For immiscible systems, two distinct Tm peaks are generally observed, as clearly shown in Fig. S5(a) and (b). Before performing the DSC studies, the proposed blend system was first studied in different solvents, as shown in Table 2. In addition, Fig. S1 shows the summarized findings. It was found that the PSF/EVOH/PEG blend was insoluble in DMSO and DMF, which could be attributed to the distant solubility parameters. The polymers demonstrated excellent solubility in NMP (d = 11.20 (cal/cm3)1/2) and DMAC (d = 11.1 (cal/cm3)1/2). The parameters of the solubility (d) between PSF (9.63 (cal/cm3)1/2) [20] and EVOH32 (11.05 (cal/cm3)1/2) [39], as well as those of the two solvents, lie very close to one another resulting in excellent solubility (Table 2). Hence, DMAC was chosen as a suitable solvent for the current study.",192
323,"Further, Fig. 6 shows the top surface, the bottom surface, and cross-sectional SEM micrographs of the pristine PSF/ PEG (M0) and PSF/EVOH32 membranes with PEG (M1-M3) and without PEG (M2b). It can be seen in Fig. 6(a) that the morphology of the PSF/EVOH32 (90/10 w/w) (M2b) blend membrane without PEG exhibited a macrophase-separated morphology, where EVOH32 was a dispersed phase, and PSF was a continuous phase. The cross-section shows connected cell-like pore morphologies with uniform distribution of pore sizes. In addition, island structure or spherical domains are most evident on the top surface [32]. This is attributed to the characteristic feature of the instantaneous phase separation due to the immiscibility between PSF and EVOH, leading to the thermodynamic instability of the casting solution. Further, Fig. 6(b) shows the morphology of M0 (PSF/PEG). The cross-section exhibited a typical asymmetric structure with a dense skin layer and sponge-like support resulting from a delayed demixing phenomenon. This is owed to the role of PEG polymers as pore formation additives and the increasing viscosity of the casting solution with the addition of PEG.",179
324,"To solidify the above observation, the influence of the PEG concentration in the PSF/EVOH32 casting solution on the morphology of the blended membranes was explored, as shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the PSF/EVOH32 blend membrane with 4 wt% PEG 20 kDa (M2-4) exhibits a typical asymmetric structure with a dense skin layer at the top, a finger-like structure at the mid-section, and sponge-like at the bottom. When the PEG concentration increased to 8 wt% and 10 wt% in the casting solution, the finger-like structure was replaced by macrovoids, and a sponge-like structure formed at the top layer in the resultant blend membranes (M2-8 and M2-10). Interestingly, the blend membrane (M2-12) obtained from a very high PEG content (12 wt%) in the casting solution exhibited a complete sponge-like structure Fig. 7(d). The PEG in the dope solution increased the viscosity (Fig. S4) and affected the kinetics of the membrane to delayed mixing during the membrane formation, finally improving the miscibility between PSF and EVOH and suppressing macrovoid formation [34,35].",172
325,"Additionally, Fig. 9 shows the TEM photographs for the PSF/EVOH32 (M2-0) blend without PEG and M2 with PEG. In the photographs, the force applied to acquire ultrathin slices using the microtome caused damage in all the prepared membrane samples. This damage directly resulted from poor interaction within the polymers [37]. Immiscible M2-0 (4000 x magnification) showed large voids while M2 membranes prepared with PEG as a compatibilizer can be seen at high magnification with 4000 x and 15000 x . Better adhesion was observed as the deformations generated during microtomic preparation were smaller than in M2-0 [38].",97
326,"The surface chemical compositions and segregation behaviour of the atoms of the pristine PSF(M0) and PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes with and without PEG were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 10 and Table 3. The oxygen peak (O1s,  550 eV) in the XPS spectrum of M0-0 and M0 is likely due to the residual PEG in the polymer matrix and was also observed in Fig. S10(a). Fig S10(a) and (b) depict the recorded spectral details PSF0, M20, EVOH32, and PSF, M1, M2, and M3. The spectrum for the control EVOH32 showed prominent absorption peaks of stretching vibration at 2852 cm-1(C-H), 2922 cm-1 (C-H), and  3300 cm-1 (O-H). As shown in Fig. 10, PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes displayed the characteristic C1 (C1, 201 eV), S (S2p,  174 eV), and oxygen (O1s,  550 eV) peaks in the XPS spectra [29,38].",140
327,"Generally, the membrane formation dynamic affects the morphology structure and properties of the resultant membrane. Table 4 shows the properties of the blend membranes. The results revealed that the pore size distribution experienced a significant change subject to the varying membrane compositions. The mean pore radius increased to 40.2 nm (M2) when the EVOH32 concentration increased to 15 wt% then slightly decreased to 35.2 nm (M3). Additionally, the membrane's bulk porosity also increased. This can be attributed to the enhanced hydrophilicity with increased EVOH32 content, which induced instantaneous phase separation favourable for porous skin layer formation with a finger-like sub-layer.",100
328,"Table 4 also shows the effects of EVOH32 copolymer content on the mechanical properties of tensile strength and elongation at break of the prepared PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes. It was found that the mechanical strength of the membranes decreased upon the incorporation of increasing quantities of EVOH32. For instance, PSF membrane (M0) possesses a tensile strength of 4.6 +- 0.7 MPa with an elongation at break of 12.8 +- 0.2% (Table 4). Meanwhile, in the blend M3 membrane, the tensile strength, and elongation at break decrease to 3.3 +- 0.3 MPa and 7.4 +- 0.6%, respectively. It seems that this phenomenon, also observed in Table S1, can be primarily attributed to the increase in porosity, pore size, and the weak points in the membrane structure created by the inner finger-like morphology, as proposed in Fig. 8[37].",135
329,"Time-dependent contact angle experiments are used extensively to determine membranes' surface hydrophilicity and wettability [33,34]. Fig. 11 illustrates the time-dependent contact angles of the membranes prepared with increasing EVOH32 mass ratios. It can be observed from Fig. 11 that the contact angle of the membranes reduced as the EVOH32 concentration increased, suggesting that the PSF membrane's hydrophilicity improved with an increase of the hydrophilic EVOH32 copolymer. For example, owning to the lack of the hydrophilic EVOH32 polymer, the pristine PSF membrane shows the most hydrophobic properties with an initial water contact angle of 80deg, subsequently showing a minimum change to 76deg after the water drop of100 s. In contrast, the modified PSF/EVOH32 membranes show noticeable changes, the initial water contact angle of M1 was 77deg, and the terminal water contact angle was 71deg. For M2, the water contact angle was initially around 75deg and decreased rapidly to 67deg, which indicated that uniformly distributed EVOH32 in M2 increased the surface hydrophilicity and permeability. Accordingly, the hydrophilicity for M3 was highest at every point, with the first and last water contact angles at 71deg and 59deg, respectively.",185
330,"This can be further explained because, upon NIPS, the hydrophilic portions of the EVOH32 spontaneously migrated to the membrane-water interface, thereby decreasing the interface energy. The accumulation of the EVOH32 on the surface of the blended membranes resulted in a reduced contact angle. As the EVOH32 mass ratio increased, resulting in higher accumulation on the surface, the contact angles of the corresponding membranes reduced accordingly, as shown in Fig. 8 and confirmed using XPS in Fig. 9. [6,12,41]. A similar trend was observed in Fig. S8 with the increase in PEG.",91
331,"The pure water permeance of the PSF/EVOH32 membranes was measured and is reported in Fig. 12. PWP significantly increased from 171 L.m-2h-1 bar-1for the pristine PSF membrane (M0) to 316 L.m-2h-1 bar-1for membrane M3 with the highest EVOH32 content. This increase in pure water permeance is attributed to the combination of the PSF/EVOH32 membrane improved surface hydrophilicity (Fig. 12), enhanced porosity, and the increase in pore size. In addition, Fig. 8 indicates enhanced interconnection of pores which promotes the formation of extra channels for pure water permeation (see Table 4) [9]. A similar trend was also observed in Fig. S9, owing to the influence of the hydrophilic additives.",108
332,"In general, the enhanced hydrophilicity owed to EVOH32 attracts water molecules to the surface of the membranes and the interior of the pores, facilitating their transport through the matrix of the blend membranes. This is favourable for the improvement of pure water permeance. As described in prior sections, the enhanced hydrophilicity results from the EVOH32 copolymer abundant OH groups [14,39].",60
333,"The BSA rejection and permeation behaviour of the prepared membranes is shown in Fig. 13. The BSA permeance increased with decreasing BSA solute permeability. The rejection values revealed that upon the addition of increasing EVOH32 quantities in the blended system, the rejection slightly decreased due to the increased size of the membrane pores (Table 4). The BSA rejection by PSF (M0) was the highest at 96 %, and M2 was the lowest at 91%. Despite the decrease in BSA rejection with blend membranes, the values increased slightly for M1 and M3 membranes compared to M2.",95
334,"The probable reason for the increase in BSA rejection is the increase in surface hydrophilicity upon blending with a hydrophilic additive, which results in a stronger repulsion to BSA. The decline observed with M2 may be due to the larger pore size (Table 4) [14,40]. The BSA permeance is also shown in Fig. 13. The pristine PSF membrane (M0) showed a BSA permeation value of 98 L.m-2h-1 bar-1, the lowest compared to the blended membranes. The pristine PSF membrane displayed the lowest porosity, and SEM cross-sections (Fig. 7) show that the pores did not form and open up from top to bottom in the downstream section of the membrane, as observed with the blend membranes.",115
335,"Fig. 13 also demonstrated that the order of solution permeance (SP) for the blended membranes was PSF/EVOH32 (85/15 wt%) (M3) (144 L.m-2h-1 bar-1) > PSF/EVOH32 (95/5 wt%) (M2) (136 L.m-2h-1 bar-1) > PSF/EVOH32 (90/10 wt%) (M1) (128 L.m-2h-1 bar-1) > pristine PSF membrane (M0) (L.m-2h-1 bar-1). This increase was attributed to the morphology and EVOH32 concentration increase in the blended membranes. The PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes exhibited greater water permeance and higher BSA rejection in contrast to the bare PSF membrane. This finding addresses the conventional trade-off relationship between permeability and selectivity of membranes. Therefore, it is evident that the PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes have a broad potential application in the industry of protein separation.",113
336,"The application of ultrafiltration membranes in the real world requires the antifouling behaviour and the long-term performance to be stable and lower the manufacturing and maintenance costs. To further investigate the antifouling performance as a permeance change in PSF and PSF/EVOH32 ultrafiltration membranes, three cycles of filtration studies were conducted. Fig. 14 shows the permeance curves over time. Fig. 15 shows the total fouling decline rate (PDRt), reversible fouling (PDRr), irreversible fouling (PDRirr), and the permeance recovery rate (PRR).",79
337,"The pristine PSF membrane (M0) shows a greater decline (Fig. 14) be attributed to its hydrophobic nature allowing strong interactions between the membrane top surface and the BSA foulant. Commonly, the hydrophobic BSA protein tends to collapse the weakly formed water layers and, in turn, interact more quickly and form strong forces with the hydrophobic membrane that cannot be easily washed off [41]. In contrast, the PSF/EVOH32 blended membranes exhibited higher permeance than the bare PSF membrane for pure water and BSA solution (Fig. 14). This confirms that the PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes display enhanced antifouling and stability in the long term.",101
338,"As mentioned, Fig. 15 presents the permeance recovery (PRR) study to further reflect the antifouling propensity of the prepared membranes. The PRR value calculation considered the pure water permeance and model BSA solution permeance to primarily assess the efficacy of the cleaning steps between cycles. The permeance recovery ratio (PRR) of membranes M0, M1, M2, and M3 was 70 %, 84%, 87%, and 75%, respectively. The PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes (M1-M3) exhibited a higher PRR than the bare PSF (M0), which implies that the BSA deposition was loosely fixed and could be easily removed during the washing stages.",97
339,"This result further demonstrates that the addition of EVOH32 improved the hydrophilic properties of the blend membrane, thereby significantly decreasing the hydrophobic interaction between the surface of the membrane and the hydrophobic BSA, resulting in significantly suppressed fouling. The ability of hydrophilic EVOH32 to spontaneously migrate and align at the top surface of the blend membrane, resulting in small pore sizes and adjacent water layer decreasing the interfacial energy during filtration, resulted in weaker BSA adsorption; a well-established phenomenon [42].",80
340,"Usually, in the PSF/EVOH32 blend membrane filtration operations, water molecules assemble on the membrane surface, and hydrogen bonds emerge between the hydrophilic OH polar groups (hydration layer) [42]. This ordered orientation of the water molecules should be displaced before the BSA molecules can adsorb onto the membrane and keep the BSA molecules in solution. Hence, the blended membranes show a better antifouling propensity compared to the pristine PSF membranes. As shown, the PRR obtained from M3 was lower than that of M1 and M2 (Fig. 15) and is attributed to larger surface pore size and greater surface roughness.",98
341,"Additional antifouling permeance decline variables including DRt, DRr, and DRirr were also calculated as shown in Fig. 15. The results show that the Rr for all the PSF/EVOH32 blend membranes was high, which indicated that a greater amount of the BSA protein foulant could be removed during the physical washing steps. In contrast, the DRirr value calculated for the PSF membrane was the highest, signifying that fouling of the membrane was predominantly irreversible. The irreversible fouling decreased from M0 (30%) to M1 (16%), M2 (13%), and M3 (24%), further proving the improvement in membrane antifouling properties. Specifically, the detrimental irreversible fouling was ascribed to the accumulation of hydrophilic EVOH32 on the surface, which inhibited the BSA protein molecule from direct interaction with the hydrophobic PSF membrane and resulted in easy removal upon washing and significantly recovering permeance. The negligible decline in permeance was attributed to concentration polarization and irreversible adsorption of the BSA protein on the top and within the pores of the membranes. Finally, the antifouling experiments show that the addition of EVOH32 could efficiently enhance the antifouling performance, particularly the unfavorable irreversible fouling.",185

347,"Water shortage has posed significant threats to human development and even life, which is becoming a global concern [1-3]. One main reason for the shorten available freshwater is the large quantity of water requirement from the modern industry, which discharges polluted water and even contaminates more clean water, e.g., textile wastewater. One effective technique to deal with the above issue is to purify the water from the wastewater, which could realize two birds with one stone: obtaining clean water while reducing the environmental contamination. Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes are broadly applied for the removal of large-size pollutants in the wastewater, such as colloidal particles, oil emulsions, and viruses, etc. [4]. Nevertheless, owing to the relatively large pore size, plenty of small-size soluble contaminants can still pass through the UF membranes, e.g., in the textile wastewater, hampering their extended applications.",138
348,"Recently, tight UF (TUF) membranes have been proposed to address the above issue, which has shown distinctive advantages in managing highly-saline textile wastewater for achieving zero liquid discharge [5-7]. As such, different kinds of TUF membranes were fabricated to improve the separation performance [8-10]. Commonly, the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique is utilized to prepare the UF membrane [11-13]. However, due to the requirement of small pore size, TUF membranes cannot be directly fabricated by using the commercial polymers, e.g., polysulfone (PSf) and poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), via directly NIPS process, which will suffer from low porosity and wide pore size distribution and remarkably reduce the separation efficiency for highly-saline textile wastewater treatment [14].",115
349,"Subsequently, several post-treatment methods, such as mussel-inspired deposition, interfacial polymerization (IP), self-assembly film, etc., were proposed to prepare TUF membranes [22-24]. Mi et al. fabricated a polyamide/PSf composite membrane via IP method by polymerization of large-molecule-size ether amine monomers with trimesoyl chloride [25]. The prepared composite membrane showed a high dye/salt rejection ratio, e.g., 95.4% for methyl blue (MB) and 16.4% for NaCl, but poor pure water flux (~16.6 LMH). Ye et al. later employed hydrophilic materials to fabricate the TUF membrane via co-deposition of polydopamine and polyethyleneimine onto polyacrylonitrile substrate, which enhanced the pure water flux to ~ 30.0 LMH with a high rejection (>98.2%) to various reactive dyes and low rejection (less than3.0%) to Na2SO4[26]. Though the post-treatment methods are convenient, the coated dense layer results in low water flux.",132
350,"The physical aging phenomenon is a typical feature for polymers, originating from the out-of-equilibrium system [27-29]. A thermodynamically stable state can be re-established in a rapid speed by heating the polymers to accelerate physical aging, which provides a method to tailor the microstructure of polymer membranes [30-33]. Yang et al. utilized the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the additives to fabricate polyethersulfone (PES)/PVP membrane, and the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the fabricated membrane could be reduced from 214.0 to 66.9 kDa by physical aging, i.e., heating the membrane in water at 90 degC [34]. Thus, physical aging could be a promising and convenient approach for the preparation of TUF membrane, but considering the higher glass transition temperature (Tg) of PES (225 degC), it requires a much higher temperature for obtaining PES-based TUF membrane. And to the best of our knowledge, no study has been reported to employ the physical aging method to fabricate the TUF membrane for the separation of dyes and salts.",162
351,"Herein, taking the advantages of our previously developed polysulfate (PSE) membranes [35,36], e.g., lower Tg (86 degC), high pure water flux, and acid/alkaline-resistance properties, a high-performance TUF membrane was firstly fabricated by using PSE and PVP via NIPS technique coupled with the physical aging method. The morphology and microstructure evolution with different physical aging temperatures were systematically studied and characterized, which demonstrated the possibility of these membranes for separation complex dye/salt mixtures. The optimized PSE/PVP TUF membrane was employed for removal of dyes from the dye/salt aqueous solution. Furthermore, the long-term stability and antifouling performance of the PSE/PVP membrane were also investigated. Our work establishes a simple avenue to fabricate a high-performance TUF membrane for practical textile wastewater treatment.",119
352,"Polysulfate (PSE, MW = 80 kDa) was kindly supplied by Baiyin Tuwei New Materials Technology Co., Ltd. Dimethylformamide (DMF), polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP), Methyl orange (MO, MW = 327 Da), Acid fuchsin (AF, MW = 585 Da), Congo red (CR, MW = 696 Da), Methyl blue (MB, MW = 799 kDa), Na2SO4 (analytical grade), were purchased from FUCHEN (Tianjin) Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Evans blue (EB, MW = 960 Da), Reactive red 195 (RR, Mw = 1136 Da), poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) were purchased from Macklin Inc. De-ionized (DI) water was used in all experiments. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.",108
353,"PSE/PVP blend membranes were prepared by NIPS methods. A certain amount of PVP was completely dissolved in DMF (24 g), then PSE (6 g) was added to obtain a homogeneous casting solution under continuous stirring at 80 degC for 12 h. After eliminating air bubbles, a thin film was cast on a clean glass plate by a casting knife with a gap of 300 um at 25 degC. Then, the film was immediately immersed in a coagulation bath (DI water, 25 degC) for the complete removal of residual solvents. Then the membranes were heated in DI water at various temperatures for 8 h to physical aging. After cool to room temperature, the wet membranes were directly used for the filtration tests. For other characterizations, the membranes were dried at ambient conditions. The detail of PVP content and the physical aging temperature was shown in Table 1.",146
354,"The chemical compositions on the membranes surface were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi, Thermo Fisher, USA) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR, Tensor II, Bruker, Germany). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from a JSM-6700 (JEOL, Japan). The samples were sputter-coated with platinum before observation. Elemental compositions of the membranes were analyzed using an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) apparatus along with SEM. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were obtained from a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) 214 Polyma (Netzsch, Germany). The samples are cooled from 30 degC to -50 degC at a rate of 10 degC/min, then reheated to 250 degC under the same rate. The Tg was determined based on the mid-point transition temperature. The porosity of the membrane was calculated using the following Eq. (1):(1)e(%)=ww-wdrwAdx100%",131
355,"where e is the membrane porosity (%), ww is wet membrane weight (mg, all pores filled with water), wd is the dry membrane weight (mg), rw is the density of water (mg/cm3), A is the area of membrane (cm2) and d is the thickness of the membrane (cm). The membrane thickness was measured by a micrometer. The water contact angle was measured using a contact-angle measurement apparatus (DSA-100, KRUSS, Germany) based on the sessile-drop method. The pore size distribution of the membranes was calculated by the solute rejection experiments [37-39]. Neutral solutes of PEG and PEO with various molecular weights were employed as the probe molecules and the solute rejections were tested. The concentrations of the solutes were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC, Multi N/C 3100, Jena, Germany). The solute rejection R was calculated by Eq. (2):(2)R=1-CpCfx100%",140
356,"where Cp and Cf are the solute concentrations of the permeate and feed, respectively. The stoke diameters of the PEG and PEO solutes were calculated based on their molecular weights by the following equations [34], respectively:(3)ForPEG,ds=33.46x10-12xM0.557(4)ForPEO,ds=20.88x10-12xM0.587",36
357,The probability density function curve of membrane pore size is obtained based on the Eq. (5):(5)dRdpddp=1dplnsp2pexplndp-lnmp22lnsp,16
358,"where dp is the pore diameter, mp is the mean effective pore diameter obtained at R = 50% and sp is geometric standard deviation defined as the ratio of pore diameter at R = 84.13% over that at R = 50%. The viscosity of the casting solution was measured by a rotational viscometer (Jingtian Electronic Instrument RVDV-2, China) at a shear rate of 6.8 s-1 at 25 degC. The phase inversion phenomenon was visualized by an optical microscope (Olympus Bx53, Japan) and CCD camera (FuHuang AgileDevice Revealer 5F04M, China) experimental system as reported earlier [35,36].",95
359,"The membrane performances were carried out in a cross-flow filtration apparatus (Superfiltration SF-SB, China) with an effective membrane area is 7.065 cm2 and transmembrane pressure is 0.1 MPa. All the membranes were pre-compacted at 0.2 MPa pressure for at least 0.5 h to obtain a stable flux. Membrane separation performance towards model solutes (dyes, PEG, and PEO) was conducted by dissolving each model solute in DI water (0.1 g/L). Membrane filtration of CR/salt mixed solution was tested at 0.1 g/L CR with various salt (NaCl or Na2SO4) contents (5, 10, 20, 30, 40 g/L) in DI water. The flux J (L*m-2*h-1, LMH) was calculated as follows:(6)J=VTxA",106
360,where the V is the volume of the collected permeate (L) during the operation time T (h); A is the effective membrane area (m2).,24
361,"The model solute rejection R of the membrane was calculated using Eq. (2). The dye concentration was investigated using a UV-VIS spectrometer (UV-3200, Mapada, China). The salt concentration was detected by the conductivity meter (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland). All tests were performed at 25 degC. In order to ensure the reproducibility of all experimental results, at least three samples for each data were tested and results are reported as the average values with standard deviation as error bar. The selectivity (S) of dye and salt is based on the Eq. (7):(7)S=RCRRsalt",90
362,"The antifouling performance of the membrane was evaluated using CR aqueous solution (0.1 g/L) at 0.1 MPa. The tested membrane was rinsed with DI water after 60 min CR fouling, and the flux was recorded during the whole filtration process. The antifouling performance of the membrane was analyzed by flux recovery rate (FRR), total pollution (Rt), irreversible pollution (Rir), and reversible pollution (Rr).(8)FRR(%)=J2J1x100%(9)Rt(%)=J1-JpJ1x100%(10)Rir(%)=J1-J2J1x100%(11)Rr(%)=J2-JpJ1x100%",63
363,"where J1 is the pure water flux (LMH). Jp (LMH) is the flux of the CR solution, and J2 (LMH) is the pure water flux after rinsing membrane.",28
364,"The PSE/PVP membrane was fabricated via the NIPS technique, which was subsequently experienced physical aging by heating at different temperatures, i.e., 50, 60, 70, and 75 degC. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data for the PSE membrane and PSE/PVP membranes with different physical aging conditions are summarized in Fig. 1a. It can be seen the nitrogen element appears for all PSE/PVP membranes, indicating the PVP chains still surviving after the NIPS process [40]. But due to the water solubility of PVP chains, it becomes a major concern that whether the PSE/PVP membrane can stably work under an aqueous solution.",99
365,"To demonstrate the stability of PVP in the PSE/PVP membrane, the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) was employed to characterize the interaction between PSE and PVP at molecule scale. Fig. 1b shows the FTIR spectra variation of the PSE membrane, PVP powder, and different PSE/PVP blend membranes (M0, M1, M2, M3, and M4). The typical stretching vibration of the carbonyl groups peaking at 1647 cm-1 for PVP shifts to1656 cm-1 after forming the PSE/PVP membrane, confirming the formation of hydrogen bonds between PSE and PVP [41]. This is also demonstrated by the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results in Fig. S1: one glass transition temperature appears for the PSE/PVP membrane, which lies between that of PSE and PVP polymers, indicating the homogeneous membrane at molecule scale [15]. Collectively, it indicates that the prepared PSE/PVP membrane can be stably used in aqueous solution conditions without PVP leak with the hydrogen bond crosslinking [42].",151
366,"It has been well-recognized that the physical aging temperature will influence the physical aging process, and thus the microstructure of the resultant membranes [30-34]. Fig. 2 provides the variation of cross-section morphologies of the PSE/PVP blend membranes with various physical aging temperatures. Overall, all the membranes, from M0 to M4, are composed of a dense skin layer and bi-continuous porous sublayer with finger-like macrovoids, like our previous results [35]. The skin layer serves as the separation function. Thus, the thin skin layers were magnified to clearly trace their change. It can be found that the membrane skin layer thickness declines from around 2.5 (Fig. 2a2) to 0.8 mm (Fig. 2e2) with increasing physical aging temperature from room temperature to 75 degC, which can be attributed to the high temperature accelerating the polymer chains to re-establish their equilibrium state by reducing the specific volume [27,28]. As a result, the skin layer becomes denser with the physical aging temperature rising, hinting the pore size decreasing.",163
367,"Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps of the PSE/PVP blend membranes with and without physical aging given in Fig. 2f show that the nitrogen element distributes homogeneously throughout the whole membrane, proving the physical aging merely induces chains tangle without losing the PVP chains. Fig. 3 schemes the change of the PSE/PVP membrane before and after physical aging: the PSE chains and PVP chains are tangled more closely to meet the requirement of volume reduction; meanwhile, the thickness of the skin layer will decrease due to the formed tangles [30,43,44]. Thus, it can be anticipated that the MWCO of the membrane will be greatly reduced.",107
368,"Subsequently, the MWCO of the PSE/PVP membrane with different physical aging temperatures was evaluated by measuring the rejection to polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecule weight, which is summarized in Fig. 4a. Obviously, the rejection rate of all PSE/PVP membranes to PEG increases with the molecule weight. The MWCO for M0 is 293.8 kDa (Fig. 4b), which is remarkably reduced to 18.5 kDa after being treated at 50 degC (M1). With the increase of physical aging temperature, the MWCO still decreases, which is 3.9, 3.8, and 3.7 kDa for M2, M3, and M4, respectively, but the change becomes neglectable after M2. According to the data, the pore diameter of the membrane can be calculated [34]. Fig. 4c provides the probability density function curves for M0 ~ M4: the pore size distribution becomes sharper and narrower with the physical aging temperature increase. The mean effective pore diameter (mp, based on the Stokes diameters of PEG at a 50% rejection ratio) declines from 12.3 nm for M0 to 0.6 nm for M4, further confirming that the physical aging tailoring the microstructure of membranes by diminishing the pore size.",186
369,"The pure water flux (PWF) of these membranes was also measured (Fig. 4b). The PWF of M0 declines from 240.6 to 84.9 LMH after 50 degC physical aging (M1), which further diminishes to 7.6 LMH for M4. The decrease of PWF can result from the pore diameter reduction as well as the total porosity decline (Fig. 4d). Comprehensively considering the performance, in terms of MWCO and PWF, of these membranes, M2 was chosen for the following study.",77
370,"PVP, as the additive, will inevitably affect both the NIPS and the physical aging processes, and thus, the final microstructure of the PSE/PVP membrane. As such, the PVP content effect has also been investigated in detail. Fig. 5 provides the cross-sectional images of the PSE/PVP membrane experiencing physical aging at 60 degC with various PVP content (M2, and M5 ~ M9). It can be observed that the restriction on the growth of finger-like macro-voids becomes more and more severe with PVP addition (Fig. 5a-f). Notably, the macro-voids almost disappear when the PVP content reaches 25 wt% (M9, Fig. 5f). Meanwhile, the thickness of the membrane skin layer increases from 0.1 to 4.8 mm with PVP content. Similar results have been reported before [45], which is due to the high viscosity of the casting solution (Fig. S2) slowing down the non-solvent diffusion and thus declining the phase inversion rate (Fig. S3), resulting in the increased thickness of the skin layer and fewer macrovoids.",162
371,"Besides, the figure of merits of these membranes, such as MWCO and PWF, were also evaluated. Fig. 6a exhibits their rejection to PEG with different molecule weights: similarly, the rejection rate becomes higher with the increase of molecule weight for all the membranes, including M2, and M5 ~ M9. The MWCO (Fig. 6b) significantly declines from 288.2 to 3.9 kDa as PVP content increases from 1 (M5) to 20 wt% (M2), and then increases to 19.8 kDa with a further increase to 25 wt% (M9). The former is attributed to the denser structures induced by the low phase inversion speed [46] and the latter may originate from the production of larger pores due to excessive PVP chains dissolving at water [41]. The pore size distribution of these membranes can be calculated according to Fig. 6b: the mean effective pore diameter declines from 17.1 to 1.8 nm (Fig. 6c).",148
372,"The PWF of the membranes was measured: being similar to MWCO variation, the PWF firstly decreases from 263.2 (M5) to 70.7 LMH (M2) and increases to 107.5 LMH for M9 (Fig. 6b). The PWF variation for M5 ~ M2 agrees with the porosity change of the membrane (Fig. 6d), that is larger porosity and smaller skin layer thickness endow the membrane with higher PWF. However, owing to the wider pore size distribution and larger mean effective pore diameter, the PWF of M9 is higher than that of M2, though M9 has a larger skin layer thickness and lower porosity.",99
373,"Aiming at removal of dyes from saline textile wastewater, M2 was finally chosen as the optimized membrane for the subsequent tests due to its smaller MWCO with relatively higher PWF. Thus, the membrane used for membrane separation application will be M2 if without specifications.",44
374,"The separation performance of M2 in removal of different dyes from 0.1 g/L dye solutions was measured in Fig. 7 under 0.1 MPa. The rejection rates of M2 to various dyes are quite different, depending on the size of these dyes, i.e., 41.9%, 73.1%, 99.6%, 94.8%, 98.0%, and 98.5% for Methyl orange (MO, MW = 327 Da), Acid fuchsin (AF, MW = 585 Da), Congo red (CR, MW = 696 Da), Methyl blue (MB, MW = 799 kDa), Evans blue (EB, MW = 960 Da), and Reactive red 195 (RR, Mw = 1136 Da), respectively. It should be noted that M2 shows a high rejection for CR. The reason may be that the CR molecules form clusters or aggregates easily in an aqueous solution, which boosts its size and intensifies the size repulsion effect [6]. As it is well-known, high rejection rate reduces the effective transmembrane pressure during tests, resulting in decrease of the flux [47]. Thus, the membrane showing higher rejection to the dye accompanying with low flux.",169
375,"The performance of M2 is compared with other reported membranes in removal of dyes from the artificial saline textile wastewater, i.e., CR/NaCl and CR/Na2SO4 mixed solutions (Table 2). M2 offers a high rejection rate to CR (98.1%) while a low rejection rate to NaCl (0.2%) or Na2SO4 (2.3%), emphasizing the good dye/salt selectivity, which is among the top-tier separation performance. More importantly, M2 shows much higher flux, i.e., 70.7 LMH, around 1.5 to 3.5-fold enhancement, which could thus significantly reduce the cost of treatment of the textile wastewater [50].",89
376,"The long-term running stability of the membrane is a key parameter in practical applications. Owing to the interaction between PVP and PSE by hydrogen bonds, whether the water will affect the structure of M2 for a long time is a concern. Hence, the weight and water contact angle (CA) variation of M2 during 20 days shaken (120 r/min, 35 degC) in water were tested. As shown in Fig. 9a, no noticeable change for both the weight and water CA be observed, expressing the structural stability of the M2. The running stability of M2 was evaluated by continuously measuring the performance of the M2 in the separation of CR/NaCl or CR/Na2SO4 mixed solutions by fixing the CR concentration at 0.1 g/L under 0.1 MPa. As shown in Fig. 9b, the flux and salt rejection of M2 is almost unvaried when the salt concentration is fixed, with CR rejection above 98%. It means that the M2 can stably work for at least 50 h independent of the salt concentration.",167
377,"The mechanical stability of the membrane is also a concern during applications. Thus, the compaction stability of M2 was also investigated in Fig. 9d. Clearly, the flux increases while CR rejection maintains a similar level with pressure increasing from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa, expressing the good mechanical stability of the membrane. However, the NaCl rejection efficiency declines with increased pressure. The reason is that the high flux leads to the salt concentration polarization effect [35].",75
378,"Furthermore, fouling is a notorious phenomenon during continuous running. Thus, the antifouling ability of M2 was evaluated by using a 0.1 g/L CR aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 10 (a), with periodic rinsing with DI water, the flux can be largely recovered. The related antifouling index was shown in Fig. 10 (b). A flux recovery rate (FRR) of 97.5% is realized and the corresponding irreversible pollution (Rir) is 2.4% after a two-cycle test, highlighting the good antifouling ability of M2. The good antifouling property of M2 can be attributed to the good hydrophilic surface and the low surface roughness (3.4 nm, Fig. S4) of M2. The hydrophilic surface can facilitate the formation adsorb of thin water layer, inhibiting the adsorption of foulant [57]. The smoother surface blocks the adsorption by the foulants due to smaller surface area [58]. Together, the two factors enhance the antifouling ability of M2.",149
379,"The PSE/PVP blend tight ultrafiltration membrane was prepared by the non-solvent induced phase separation coupled physical aging method. The influence of PVP content and physical aging condition on the microstructures of PSE/PVP membrane were detailed investigated. The results demonstrated that increasing the physical aging and PVP content (<=20 wt%) could reduce the MWCO and flux of the membrane. After optimization, we discovered that the optimized M2 (60 degC physical aging, 20 wt% PVP) exhibited the best separation performance in dealing with dye/salt solution, i.e., a pure water flux of 70.7 LMH, the MWCO of 3.9 kDa, CR/NaCl selectivity of 494.3, CR/Na2SO4 selectivity of 42.6, good stability, and excellent antifouling performance. Thus, the membrane fabrication method we proposed opens a gate for the preparation of high-performance TUF membranes for future textile wastewater treatment.",132

385,"Membrane filtration has been widely applied in water and wastewater treatment, due to its ease of operation, compact size, high pollutant rejection selectivity and efficiency, and low energy requirement [16]. A membrane reactor is the wastewater treatment method that integrates membrane filtration with reaction simultaneously. Unfortunately, it still suffers from some problems such as low pollutant removal, lack of membrane durability, membrane fouling, unrecyclable membrane, and poor antifouling properties. A new membrane with superior characteristics that can tackle those problems is urgently required for membrane reactor technology. As a type of membrane reactor technology, the photocatalytic membrane became a popular method for treating wastewater that contains complicated contaminants [17-19]. The semiconductor materials as the photocatalysts are incorporated into the polymer matrix to synthesize the photocatalytic membrane composite. Several polymer materials are available for membrane preparation, in this study, polysulfone (PSf) was chosen as the polymer material due to its ease to incorporate with other materials, cheapness, and high mechanical strength.",160
386,"Basically, bringing the photocatalyst to the membrane's surface can provide a simultaneous filtration and photocatalytic process at a single time. Furthermore, the membrane process is susceptible to fouling formation; therefore, performing the photocatalytic process on the membrane's surface can also prevent fouling formation by degrading the attached foulants with the generated radical molecules, which can provide overall membrane performance improvements. In this present study, the Co doping into TiO2 with SiO2 as the matrix (Co-TiO2 @SiO2) composite was synthesized via the sol-gel process. The synthesized photocatalyst composite was expected to improve the photocatalytic activity, hydrophilicity, and antifouling performance of the PSf/Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membrane.",103
387,"Based on our best knowledge, none has conducted the study regarding synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation of the UV light-driven photocatalytic PSf membrane incorporated by Co-TiO2 @SiO2 composite as the photocatalyst for simultaneous membrane filtration and photocatalytic process for PRW treatment. The photocatalytic process under UV light exposure was expected to be significantly helpful in the degradation of concentrated pollutants on the membrane's surface, which can reduce fouling formation and improve the permeate flux and pollutant removal. The synthesized photocatalysts and membranes were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), particle size analyzer (PSA), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), x-ray diffraction (XRD), water contact angle, pore properties analysis, diffuse reflectance spectrometry (DRS), point of zero charges (PZC) analysis, and mechanical strength analysis. This study explored, evaluated, and compared the membrane performance in dark conditions and under UV light exposure. The photocatalytic degradation kinetics, regeneration test, photocatalytic mechanisms, fouling resistances, and antifouling properties of the membranes were also investigated. Therefore, this study can provide a better option for membrane filtration to tackle the fouling problem, enhance membrane performance, and prolong the membrane's lifetime for a reliable method of PRW treatment.",191

Methanol (CH3OH, 99%), 1,4-benzoquinone (C6H4O2, 99%), and oxalic acid (H2C2O4, 99%) for trapping test experiments were supplied from Merck, Germany. The specimen of petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW) used in this study was collected from the refinery plant of PT. Pertamina (persero), Cilacap, Central Java, Indonesia, as the pollutant characteristics are listed in Table 1. Deionized (DI) water was used in all experiments and chemical solution preparation.",192
389,"The composite membranes were fabricated by referring to the non-induced phase separation (NIPS) process [42]. Table 2 shows the variation of membrane compositions that were prepared in this study. In the beginning, a certain amount of PSf pellets were mixed into a 50 mL of NMP solvent until the PSf pellets wholly dissolved. Then, the nanoparticle with a specific amount was introduced into the solution under constant stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the mixture was put into an ultrasonic bath with an operating frequency of 60 kHz for 60 min to remove the trapped bubbles and create a better dispersion of nanoparticles. The membrane solution was cast onto a flat glass plate using a casting knife. Then, the casted solution was immersed in a DI water bath to form the membrane film, and it was left for 24 h to remove the spent solvent inside the membrane. Finally, membrane films were dried at an ambient condition.",156
390,"The scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL Series, JSM-6510-LA, Japan) was used to observe the surface micromorphology and cross-section images of as-synthesized photocatalysts and the fabricated membranes. In cross-section morphology observation, the membrane film was immersed in liquid nitrogen to increase its brittleness, so the membrane could be easier to cut into pieces for the cross-section observation. The energy dispersive x-ray (EDX, JEOL Series, Japan) was performed to capture the chemical composition, including elemental and oxide contents, and also the elemental mapping distribution of the synthesized photocatalysts and fabricated membranes. A laser particle size analyzer (PSA, Labtron Instruments, UK) was performed to provide the particle size distribution of the synthesized photocatalysts. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR, Perkin Elmer, USA) was used to characterize the chemical functional groups of as-synthesized photocatalysts and the fabricated membranes. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to investigate the crystalline structure and crystal phases of the photocatalysts and the fabricated membranes. The diffractograms were recorded using Cu Ka at 30 mA and 30 kV with a scanning speed of 3deg min-1 for a diffraction angle (2th) of 10deg - 70deg.",183
391,"The porosity measurement of the membrane was carried out by immersing the membrane for 24 h in distilled water and recording the final weight of the membrane. Afterward, the membranes were placed in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 degC, and then the dry weight of the membrane was measured. Finally, the membrane porosity was calculated using Eq. (1)[44].(1)e=wt-worwxAxdx100%where e is the membrane porosity (%), while wt and wo represent the weights of the wet and dry membranes, respectively (g). rw shows the water density at room temperature (0.997 g cm-3); A corresponds to the effective surface area (cm-2); d represents the membrane thickness (cm).",107
392,"Additionally, the average pore radius was analyzed using the Guerout-Elford-Ferry approximation by Eq. (2)[45].(2)r=8edQx(2.9-1.75e)exAxDPwhere e shows the water viscosity at room temperature (8.9 x10-4 Pa s), d represents the membrane thickness (m), Q is the volumetric flow rate of the permeate (m3 s-1), and DP shows the trans-membrane pressure (Pa).",50
393,"The material testing machine (UTS H001, China) was used to carry out the membrane mechanical strength measurements based on thickness, tensile strength, and elongation break. The measurement was subjected to a 5 x 5 cm2 flat sheet membrane sample. The sample was placed on a sample holder and carefully clamped. The sample was stretched, and the elongation rate was fixed at 20 mm/min. The measurements were subjected to each membrane sample in triplicates. A contact angle meter (RASE angle meter, Japan) was utilized to measure a static contact angle by employing the sessile drop method. The DI water at 25 degC was used as a probe liquid. The water was dripped on the membrane surface. After 3 s, its contact angle was measured. The contact angle measurement was conducted several times at various positions to obtain reproducible measurement results. The method for calculating water uptake and membrane affinity was followed from [42]. The water uptake value of fabricated membranes was calculated using Eq. (3).(3)WU=ww-wdwdx100%where WU is the water uptake (%), ww and wd are the wet and dry weights of the tested membrane (g).",184
394,"Further, the membrane's affinity towards liquid was measured using a theoretical Flory-Huggins model, which is represented in Eqs. (4) and (5).(4)ph=(ww-wdrs)(ww-wdrs)+(wdrm)(5)kh=-lnph+(1-ph)(1-ph)2where ph represents the volume fraction and kh represents the Flory-Huggins (FH) interaction parameter. rs and rm show the solvent (water) and membrane densities (g/cm3), while ww and wd are the wet and dry weights of the tested membrane (g).",60
395,"By using the spectrophotometer, the COD concentration was determined based on the potassium dichromate method, the NH3-N concentration was analyzed using Nessler's reagents (HI3824-025 test kit), and the phenol content was analyzed using HACH 183699 test kit. The following Eq. (7) was used to calculate membrane pollutant rejection.(7)R=(1-CtCo)x100%where R is rejection efficiency (%), Ct and Co are the concentration of the pollutant in permeate and feed solution, respectively (mg/L).",69
396,"The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membranes was evaluated by assessing the COD, NH3-N, and phenol degradations rate using the sample of PRW as the feed. Firstly, 100 mL of PRW sample was diluted by adding mL of DI water until 400 mL to reduce the pollutant concentration, and the photocatalytic degradation activity from the composite membranes could be noticeable. The membrane film of 5 cm in diameter was mounted onto the glass holder and was immersed into 100 mL of PRW sample. This experiment was carried out in a dark and closed chamber equipped with a UV lamp. The distance between the wastewater and the UV lamp was 10 cm. The complete illustration of the batch photocatalytic test setup can be seen in Fig. 1(b). Before the UV lamp was turned on, the membrane was immersed for 60 min in order to achieve the adsorption equilibrium state for ensuring that only the photocatalytic process was assayed. This photocatalytic process was conducted for 120 min, and COD, NH3-N, and phenol removals were measured every 20 min",176
397,"The photocatalytic degradation kinetics using the composite membranes were further evaluated by applying the zero order and pseudo-first order kinetic models [46]. The mathematical expressions of the applied kinetic models are represented in Eqs. (8) and (9), respectively.(8)Co-Ct=kot(9)ln(CoCt)=k1twhere Co and Ct represent the concentrations of pollutants at initial (mg/L) and at a specific time (mg/L), ko (mg L-1 min-1) and k1 (min-1) symbolize the rate constants of zero-order and pseudo-first order kinetic models, and t is the operating time (min).",80
398,"Trapping tests were conducted to investigate further the relevance, existence, and relative activity of the reactive species on pollutant degradations. Oxalic acid, benzoquinone, and methanol were used as the scavengers for holes, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membranes was tested in a 100 mL PRW sample containing 2 mmol of the scavengers at 30 degC for 120 min under UV irradiation. After that, the concentration of COD, NH3-N, and phenol was measured to understand the effect of scavengers on the photocatalytic activity of the fabricated membranes.",92
399,"Three consecutive cycle tests on permeate flux and pollutant removal were carried out to examine the reusability of the fabricated membranes. In the filtration experiment, the membrane was used for 3 x 120 min under UV light irradiation by collecting the permeate flux every 20 min. At the end of each cycle, the membrane was immersed in the DI water for 30 min. After that, the membrane was gently flushed using a water sprayer to remove the attached dirt on the membrane before it was used again to be tested in the next cycle.",94
400,"For the photodegradation cycle test, three-cycle tests were used to evaluate the photocatalytic stability of the tested membranes. The procedure to examine the photocatalytic activity is similar to as described in Section 2.6. In between cycles, the membrane was immersed in DI water for 30 min before being used in the next cycle test. PRW sample was renewed to ensure the initial pollutant condition was the same in every cycle test.",71
401,"The effect of UV irradiation for generating photocatalytic activity on the composite membranes can also be attributed to reducing the fouling formation on the membrane. The antifouling potential of the fabricated membranes was assessed to measure the total fouling ratio (RT), reversible fouling ratio (RR), irreversible fouling ratio (RIr), and the flux recovery ratio (FRR), as the mathematical formula is expressed in Eqs. (10)-(13), respectively [42].(10)RT=(Ji-JwJc)x100%(11)RR=(Jc-JwJi)x100%(12)RIr=(Ji-JcJi)x100%(13)FRR=(JcJi)x100%where Ji,Jc, and Jw are the initial PWF, PWF after cleaning, and the permeate flux of wastewater, respectively.",83
402,"Fig. 3(e) shows the interaction of the photocatalysts to the UV-vis light spectra ranging from 250 to 700 nm for determining their optical properties. Based on the results, it can be seen that pristine SiO2 did not show a significant change during the test, which can be justified as a non-photocatalytic material under this condition. On the other hand, pristine TiO2 demonstrated a significant interaction with the light spectrum below 400 nm, which corresponds to this sample being active under the UV light environment [14]. The combination of TiO2 to SiO2 successfully improved the response upon the light spectra. TiO2 @SiO2 composite showed the highest photon absorption at wavelength of 250-325 nm, which indicates that composite is active under UV light irradiation. Similarly, the Co addition also improved the interaction of the composite to the light spectrum, especially with the UV light spectrum. The bandgap energy was estimated using the Tauc plot method by Eq. (14), and the result is depicted in Fig. 3(f).(14)(ahv)n=A(hv-Eg)where a, h, v, n, A, and Eg represent the absorbance value, Planck constant, frequency, type of semiconductor (TiO2 is an indirect transition semiconductor material with n = 1/2), constant, and the bandgap energy, respectively.",198
403,"EDX analysis was used to quantitatively investigate the chemical composition of neat PSf and PSf/Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membranes, as the results are summarized in Table 5. Based on Table 5, it can be seen that neat PSf contains only elementals of carbon (C), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S) with concentrations of 83.45%, 11.09%, and 5.46%wt, respectively. In contrast, after the addition of Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst, the membrane's composition significantly changed. It is recorded that the several new elementals attached into PSf/ Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membrane such as sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), cobalt (Co), and zinc (Zn) with compositions of 0.09%, 0.20%, 0.45%, 0.34%, 0.09%, and 0.03%wt, respectively. The elemental composition also corresponds to the oxide composition that contained key substances, namely SiO2, TiO2, and CoO. The confirmed new chemicals, especially Si, Ti, and Co in PSf/Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membrane, signify that the photocatalyst particles successfully attached to the membrane. It was also found that the PSf/ Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membrane has a higher oxygen content than that of the neat PSf. The rich oxygen content can boost the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane, which might result in higher permeate flux.",190
404,"FTIR analysis is used to observe the developed functional groups in the fabricated membranes over a wavenumber ranging from 4000 to 450 cm-1. The results of FTIR analysis for the fabricated membranes are depicted in Fig. 7(a). Fig. 7(a) shows the FTIR spectra for the Co-TiO2 @SiO2 composite and the fabricated membranes. It can be seen that the FTIR spectra for the fabricated membranes have a similarity in their patterns which indicates the fabricated membranes contain the same polymer matrix, i.e., polysulfone. The peaks consistently signify the typical functional groups contained in polysulfone, including a peak at 1241 cm-1 that belongs to the stretching vibration of OSO groups [60]. The asymmetric peaks around 1200 cm-1 correspond to the absorption of C-H groups from polysulfone structures. A special peak at 1014 cm-1 that was recorded only on the fabricated membranes containing TiO2, namely M-03, M-05, and M-06, corresponds to the stretching vibration of Ti-O-Ti or Ti-O groups. Two different peaks at 1682 and 1431 cm-1, which shifted to the lower wavenumber confirmed in the FTIR spectrum of M-06, correspond to the vibration of Co-O groups that also indicate the Co emplacement in the TiO2 @SiO2 substructure [48].",196
405,"The crystalline structure of the fabricated membranes was analyzed using XRD analysis. Fig. 7(b) depicts the XRD diffractograms of Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst and the fabricated membranes. It can be observed that the diffractogram results of the fabricated membranes present relatively similar in their patterns. All the membranes show a broad peak at a diffraction angle of 15-20deg as the typical diffractogram pattern of polysulfone [60]. M-01 as the neat PSf membrane demonstrates smooth and without detectable peaks, signifying that M-01 has an amorphous phase that is free from any crystal structures. After the addition of photocatalysts, some membranes showed some slight changes. As an example, in M-06, after the incorporation of Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst, two small peaks are detected at a diffraction angle of 33.12deg and 77.56deg, indicating the crystallite of the anatase phase of TiO2[48]. Additionally, the weak crystalline characteristics that were observed in the fabricated membranes can be due to the small amount of photocatalysts addition in the membrane preparation. This finding can also show that the uniformity of photocatalysts dispersion across the membrane made just a tiny detection, as shown in EDX mapping results.",187
406,"The affinity of the membranes toward water molecules was examined using the theoretical Flory-Huggins (FH) model [65]. This model can be used further to understand the water sorption behavior of the fabricated membranes. Fig. 8(c) illustrates the membranes' affinities in terms of volume fraction (ph) and FH interaction parameter (kh). Based on the results, it is found that M-01 as the neat PSf membrane possessed the smallest value of volume fraction of 0.15, with an FH parameter of 1.45. With the addition of photocatalysts, the trend of volume fraction increased, with the highest value (0.44) was achieved in M-06, with the FH parameter of 0.83. The FH parameter can be used to explain the affinity between the membrane and water molecules. The lower value of the FH parameter indicates the higher sorption of water ability [65]. The higher sorption of water can lead to performance improvements on flux, pollutant rejection, and antifouling potential. The addition of Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst in the membrane resulted in the lowest value of the FH interaction parameter among the other membranes, suggesting that the membrane ability after the addition of photocatalyst can improve the membrane performance in a positive way.",195
407,"It is noteworthy that the incorporation of photocatalysts not only provides better permeate flux performance in the filtration under UV exposure but also improves the permeate flux in conventional filtration conditions (dark), as the results are shown in Fig. 9(g and h). The modified membranes with photocatalysts have higher permeate flux in both dark and under UV light conditions and also maintained stable flux performance. These phenomena can be promoted for three main reasons. First, the increase of hydrophilicity by the addition of photocatalysts, thereby increasing the attraction towards water molecules that resulted in higher permeate flux [64]. Second, the high membrane porosity generated after the addition of photocatalysts that created a larger effective filtration area and adsorbed more water inside the pore structure resulted in an increase in permeability. Third, the photocatalytic process can degrade the concentrated pollutants on the membrane's surface so that the pollutants do not deposit on the membrane's surface, and the filtration process might not be disturbed.",162
408,"These improvements can be explained by some phenomena. The embedded photocatalysts on the membrane's surface performed the photocatalytic reaction when it was exposed to UV light that creates the superoxide (0O2-) and hydroxyl (0OH) radicals, which react with the pollutants and degrade them [73]. Based on the DRS results, Co-TiO2 @SiO2 photocatalyst possessed the lowest bandgap energy among the other photocatalysts, indicating that Co-TiO2 @SiO2 is easier to perform the photocatalysis process due to relatively lower energy requirement [74]. The second reason is due to the smaller pore size of the PSf/Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membrane, which resulted in more selective separation compared to the other membranes. The third reason is based on the surface charge of the membrane as the impact of photocatalyst addition. According to the results of the PZC analysis, the addition of photocatalysts resulted in a negatively charged surface that can be helpful to provide repellency forces against the negatively charged pollutants. As a result, the improvement in pollutant rejection was achieved.",164
409,"The kinetic characteristic of pollutant degradations by photocatalysis on the fabricated membranes was investigated using two kinetic models, i.e., zero-order kinetic and pseudo-first order kinetic models. This investigation was observed by assessing the COD, NH3-N, and phenol degradation rates using PRW as the sample. The membrane sheet was mounted onto the glass holder and was immersed into the PRW sample. This experiment was performed in a dark and closed chamber utilized with a UV lamp (see Fig. 1(b)). Before the UV lamp was turned on, the membrane was left in the PRW sample for 60 min in order to achieve the adsorption equilibrium state for ensuring that only the photocatalysis was performed for the pollutant removal. Fig. 12 shows the fitting plots of degradation kinetic on COD, NH3-N, and phenol using zero-order and pseudo-first order kinetics, whereas the fitting parameters are listed in Table 7. Based on the results, it is found that the neat PSf membrane (M-01) did not show any removal performance under this photocatalytic experiment. The photocatalytic degradations of COD, NH3-N, and phenol remarkably improved in the membranes with the embedded photocatalysts (M-02 - M-06).",188
410,"Furthermore, the PSf/Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membrane exhibited the best pollutant degradation performance on both of the kinetic models, reflected by the more significant slope on the plots compared to the other membranes. According to the coefficient of determinations (R2), the photocatalytic degradations are relatively better fitted to the pseudo-first order kinetic model compared to the zero-order kinetic model. In PSf/Co-TiO2 @SiO2 membrane, the estimated R2 were 0.9817, 0.9952, and 0.9968 for COD, NH3-N, and phenol removals, respectively. The photocatalytic membranes possessed the pseudo-first order rate constants larger than the neat PSf on all types of pollutants. It is found that the PSf/Co-TiO2 @SiO2 has the rate constants of 0.0064, 0.0068, and 0.0059 min-1 for COD, NH3-N, and phenol removals, respectively. The higher rate constant means that a faster degradation performance is achieved.",131

418,"Ultrafiltration (UF) is widely used in water treatment, biopharmaceuticals, and food processing for the removal of dissolved organic matters and microorganisms [1,2]. The materials used to fabricate membranes play important roles in the fabrication, structure, and separation performance of UF membranes. Commercial UF membranes are usually prepared from hydrophobic polymers such as polysulfone (PSf) [3], polyethersulfone (PES) [4], and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) [5]. Among them, PSf is a remarkable material for UF membrane owing to its high thermal and chemical stability, excellent membrane forming abilities, and low cost. However, its hydrophobic surface leads to the adsorption and deposition of dissolved organics via hydrophobic interactions between organics and membrane surface known as membrane fouling, which shortens the lifespan of membrane and increases operational costs [6]. Scientists have been focusing on the design and fabrication of UF membranes with high antifouling ability, mechanical property and separation performance. Various methods, such as surface coatings [7,8], surface grafting, additive blending [9,10], and functionalization of membrane materials have been proposed to adjust the structure, property and performance of UF membranes.",175
419,"Functionalization of membrane materials introduced hydrophilic groups such as sulfonic acid group [11], sulfonamide group [12] or hydroxyl group [13] into PSf. Among them, sulfonated polysulfone (SPSf) was usually blended into hydrophobic membrane matrix polymer, such as polysulfone [14], polyethersulfone [15] and Troger's base polymer [16] to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity and antifouling ability. For instance, SPSf was blended with PSf for preparation of PSf/SPSf blend UF membrane to adjust the membrane structure and properties [14]. The SPSf content in the casting solution of PSf UF membrane was limited by the low compatibility between hydrophilic SPSf and hydrophobic PSf, which in turn determined its low blend content and property improvement. However, to our best knowledge, SPSf has not been used as the matrix material for UF membrane due to the strong interaction between sulfonic acid group and water molecule. It has been reported that the slow precipitation rate of sulfonated polymer during the non-solvent induced phase inversion process determined its poor pore-forming ability for UF membrane [17,18]. Moreover, the strongly hydrated sulfonic acid groups raise the flexibility of sulfonated polymer chains, membrane water uptake and water-induced swelling ratio and consequently lead to poor mechanical strength of SPSf membrane.",198
420,"SPSf with a sulfonation degree of 5% obtained from Tianjin Yanjin Technology Co., Ltd., (China) was chosen as the membrane matrix. Troger's base (TB) polymer (see Scheme 1) was synthesized from dimethoxymethane (98.0%), 4, 4'-diamino-3, 3'-dimethyl-biphenyl (98%), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 99.0%) which were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd., (China). Ammonia solution (NH4OH, 99.0%), trichloromethane (CHCl3, >99.0%), and methanol (CH3OH, 99.7%) purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., (China) were used during the precipitation and washing process of Troger's base (TB) polymer.

421,"All membranes were prepared by the non-solvent induced phase separation process (NIPS) method. Table 1 shows the detailed composition of the casting solutions used for membrane fabrication. SPSf was initially added into NMP solution with various concentrations of TB polymer as an additive. The TB polymer concentration in the casting solutions was fixed at 0 wt%, 3 wt%, 7 wt%, 10 wt%, and 15 wt% relative to the total weight of SPSf and TB blend polymers, and the corresponding prepared membranes were named as SPSf, SPSf/TB-3, SPSf/TB-7, SPSf/TB-10, and SPSf/TB-15. The casting solutions were stirred at 60 degC for 12 h and vacuumed for another 3 h without stirring to ensure the complete release of bubbles. The resultant homogeneous casting solution was casted on a clean glass plate to form a uniform 150 mm-thick film using a steel knife. After exposure to air for 30 s, it was immersed in a coagulation bath of deionized water at 60 degC and UF membrane was obtained. The membranes were kept in deionized water for 48 h, and water was changed frequently to ensure the removal of NMP.",185

The casting solution for each membrane was casted on a clean glass plate and dried in an air dry oven at 60 degC for 24 h and then in a vacuum oven at 105 degC for 24 h.",64
423,"Cloud point measurements: In order to understand the effect of TB polymer addition on the membrane formation and morphology, the cloud points of casting solution for SPSf and SPSf/TB-15 membranes were determined by our previous method [26].

Small amount of deionized water (50 mL) was dropped into the agitating solution each time until turbidity was observed and remained for 30 min. The quantity of water for 10 g casting solution to remain turbid for more than 30 min, indicating the occurrence of phase separation, was determined. The cloud points for different casting solutions were given by phase diagram and water concentration in the polymer solution in Table 1.",137

The membrane was pre-pressurized at 0.15 MPa for 30 min to stabilize the pure water flux of the membrane. The initial pure water flux of the virgin membranes (Jwv) was obtained by filtering deionized water through the membrane at 0.1 MPa for 30 min, and then the BSA solution (0.2 g/L, in PBS solution, pH = 7.4) was filtrated for 1 h. Next, the membranes were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, and the pure water flux of the cleaned membranes (Jwc) was measured for another 30 min. The BSA solution filtration and water washing processes were repeated three times. The permeate was weighed every 2 min by an electronic balance connected to a computer. The flux of the membranes Jwv (L m-2 h-1) was calculated using Eq. (3):(3)Jwv=mrA^twhere m (kg) is the mass of permeated water, A (m2) is the effective membrane area, r refers to the density of the permeate (1.0 kg/L), and Dt (h) is the permeation time of deionized water.",188
433,"The BSA retention factor (R) of the membranes was calculated from Eq. (4):(4)R(%)=(1-CpCf)x100%where Cf is the BSA concentration in the feed, and Cp refers to the BSA concentration in the permeate, which were determined by measuring the absorption at 278 nm using UV-Vis spectrophotometry.",44
434,"The dynamic protein antifouling performance of ultrafiltration membranes was expressed in terms of the flux recovery ratio (FRR), which was calculated using Eq. (5):(5)FRR(%)=JwcJwvx100%",24
435,"Fig. 2 exhibits the XPS spectra of SPSf/TB-10 membrane after being immersed in solutions with different pH values for 24 h. Under alkaline condition, quaternary amine groups were not detected because the acid-base pairs of tertiary amine groups and sulfonic acid groups were destroyed by the neutralization reaction of sulfonic acid groups. This also indicated the acid-base crosslinking structure between SPSf and TB polymer.",64
436,"Membrane surface properties such as surface roughness, membrane charge, and hydrophilicity play important roles in the performance of UF membrane. AFM was used to investigate the membrane surface morphology. Fig. 3 illustrates the 2D and 3D surface morphologies of the membranes. Ra, Rq, and Rz are used to indicate the roughness of the membranes. As shown in Table 2, compared with the pristine SPSf membrane, Ra and Rq increased and then decreased as the TB polymer content increased. This may have been caused by two factors. Firstly, the increased surface roughness was accompanied by an increase in the surface porosity, as shown in Table 3 [12]. Secondly, the thinner top layer was more susceptible to decreased surface roughness [31], and a lower Rz may have been caused by a decrease in the thickness of the top layer [32].",138
437,"The surface charge of all membranes was evaluated from zeta potential measurements at pH = 7. The SPSf pure membrane shows a negative zeta potential (z = -66.1 mV) due to the deprotonation of partial sulfonic acid groups [33]. The acid-base interaction between tertiary amines of blended TB polymer and sulfonic acid groups SPSf would promote the deprotonation of sulfonic acid groups. As expected, the zeta-potentials of SPSf/TB blend membranes were more negative (z = -72.5, -73.2, -74.7, and -79.2 with the increase of TB polymer content) than SPSf membrane. This also indicated the acid-base crosslinking between TB polymer and SPSf.",101
438,"The surface hydrophilicity of UF membranes depends on the material's hydrophilicity, which is typically characterized by the water contact angle of UF membranes. As shown in Fig. 4, the water contact angle increased with increasing hydrophobic TB polymer content, but the water contact angle of SPSf/TB-15 (89deg) was lower than 90deg, indicating that it was hydrophilic. The water contact angle of each UF membrane was lower than that of the corresponding dense membrane because the surface roughness of the UF membrane was higher than the dense membrane.",87
439,"The membrane morphology was characterized by SEM (Fig. 5), and the average surface pore size and surface porosity are listed in Table 3. All blend membranes showed larger average surface pore sizes and higher porosities than the SPSf UF membrane. The SPSf/TB blend membranes had surface porosities in the range of 6.0-14.8%, which were much higher than that of the pristine SPSf membrane (2.6%). The average surface pore size of the blend membranes ranged from 13.0 to 19.0 nm, which was 1.56-2.28 times larger than the SPSf membrane. Therefore, blending TB polymer with SPSf promoted the formation of membrane surface pores during the NIPS process. Compared to TB polymer-based membrane in previous work [16], SPSf/TB blend membrane showed smaller average surface pore size than TB/SPSf blend membranes (26.5-67.1 nm), even though their surface porosity was similar (6.7-13.5% for TB/SPSf blend membrane).",141
440,"All membranes exhibited asymmetric structures with a dense top layer and a porous sublayer with finger-like pores. The thickness of the dense top layer (the distance from the top surface to the starting point of the finger-like pores, see Fig. 5) gradually decreased from 19.6 mm for the SPSf membrane to 3.1 mm for the SPSf/TB-15 membrane. The morphology of the porous sublayer with finger-like pores significantly changed after blending with TB polymer. When the TB polymer content was increased to 10%, the finger-like pores became more regular and vertically interconnected, and the total porosity increased from 75.3% to 89.6%. It is worth mentioning that SPSf/TB blend membrane showed higher total porosity than TB/SPSf blend membranes (60.4-82.9%) and the sublayer of TB/SPSf blend membranes exhibited a fully sponge-like structure [16]. The higher surface porosity, higher total porosity and a thinner top layer would contribute to improving the permeability of the UF membrane.",152
441,"The mechanical properties of the UF membranes are presented in Table 4. The Young's modulus and tensile strength of the SPSf/TB blend membranes gradually increased as the TB polymer content increased, but the elongation at break gradually decreased. In other words, the addition of the TB polymer increased the mechanical strength of the SPSf UF membrane due to the formation of acid-base pairs between sulfonic acids and tertiary amines, which enhanced the intermolecular interactions between TB polymer and SPSf [38]. Therefore, during the NIPS process, the crosslinked SPSf became less capable of hydrogen bonding with water molecules, which decreased the plasticizing effect of absorbed water and reduced the water uptake and swelling of the membranes [38,39]. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the membranes were increased.",125
442,"However, the static BSA adsorption experiments showed the opposite antifouling performance. The adsorption of BSA on SPSf/TB-7, SPSf/TB-10, and SPSf/TB-15 (Fig. 10) were 156.1 mg/cm2, 91.1 mg/cm2, and 146.8 mg/cm2. These values were much lower than that (355.3 mg/cm2) of the pristine SPSf UF membrane, indicating the better antifouling performance of SPSf/TB blend membrane than pristine SPSf membrane. The most likely reason for the antifouling performance difference lies in the dominant antifouling mechanism of the membrane surface in two kinds of experiments. In static experiments, membrane antifouling is mainly based on electrostatic repulsion. The potential of BSA is -20.7 mv in PBS (pH = 7) [43]. The surface potential of the blend membrane (z = -72.5 ~ -79.2 mV) was better compared with the SPSf pure membrane (z = -66.1 mV). The enhanced membrane charge of the blend membrane surfaces strengthened the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and BSA, thereby reducing BSA adsorption.",154
443,"During ultrafiltration experiments, the main reasons of the different antifouling results are summarized as follows. Firstly, it has been reported that smoother membrane surfaces are less prone to the accumulation and deposition of organic protein pollutants, and the formation of a filter cake layer, which results in better antifouling performance [44,45]. The pores of membranes with rough surface tended to be blocked and promote the formation of BSA filter cake layer, which induced membrane fouling under pressure [46,47]. Secondly, the water contact angle of the blend membrane was larger, implying its lower surface hydrophilicity; thus, the membrane surface did not easily combine with water to form a hydration layer [37,48]. Thirdly, the pore size of the blend membranes was relatively large, and BSA was more likely to enter and block the pores of the membrane, causing irreversible fouling [49]. All three reasons caused the accumulation of BSA on the membrane surface and pores, and the precipitation reduced the washing efficiency of water, which decreased the FRR of the blend membranes.",170
444,"In this work, SPSf-based ultrafiltration membrane was prepared by non-solvent induced phase inversion method and its porosity, permeability and mechanical strength were improved by blending Troger's base polymer. The stability of casting solution was reduced by the blended hydrophobic TB polymer and its pore-forming ability was improved, which led to reduced top layer thickness and higher porosity. The high backbone rigidity of TB polymer also helped to improve the porosity of blend membrane. The thin top layer and high porosity of SPSf/TB blend membrane resulted permeability enhancement of UF membrane. The acid-base crosslinking structure between SPSf and TB polymer was beneficial to their good compatibility and improving the mechanical strength of blend membrane.",113

451,"Although many potential green alternatives have been introduced, most are intended for use in TIPS membrane preparation, which occurs at high temperatures [27,28,31,34]. It has been comparatively difficult to identify solvents that dissolve polymer at ambient temperature for use in NIPS processes. Since polymers used in membrane fabrication typically exhibit high chemical resistance, solvents with high solvent power are required to dissolve them. Such solvents are usually classified as toxic chemicals. PolarClean(r) is one of the exceptions, as it exhibits high solubility for conventional polymers but low toxicity and good biodegradability. For these reasons, PolarClean(r) has been used for membrane preparation with PES, PSF, and PVDF [18,27,30,35,36]. Despite its promising properties, the feasibility of PolarClean(r) compared to other conventional polymers has been investigated in relatively few studies.",127
452,"In this work, we investigate the feasibility of PolarClean(r) for use in NIPS membrane fabrication for applications such as UF and NF. The top three most frequently used polymers other than PVDF, i.e., PES, PSF, and CA, were fabricated into asymmetric membranes via NIPS. We characterized the performances of the resulting membranes in terms of water flux, salt rejection, and mechanical properties and compared them to other UF and NF membranes described in the literature.",75
453,"PSU (P3500, Mw = 66.1 kDa) and Rhodiasolv PolarClean(r) (Methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate) were provided by Solvay Specialty Polymers (Bollate, Italy) and Solvay Novecare, respectively. PES (Mw = 75 kDa) was purchased from BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). CA (39.7% acetyl content, Mn = 50 kDa), Pluronic F-127 (Mw = 12.5 kDa), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 55 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Analytical grade ethanol (EtOH), sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium sulfoxide (MgSO4), and hexane were purchased from Daejung Chemicals (Siheung, South Korea). All materials were used without further purification.",93
454,"The binodal curves in ternary phases of polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent system were experimentally obtained for determining the onset of phase separation behavior in the NIPS process. Binodal curves were measured by the cloud point method [19,37]. In the first step, 20 g of clear and homogeneous polymer solutions with different polymer concentrations of 10, 15, and 20 wt% were prepared. At coagulation temperature (30 degC), a known quantity of deionized (DI) water was added as a non-solvent until the polymer solution was no longer homogeneous and became turbid. If regional precipitation was observed, the point was recorded as a coagulation value involving only separation of liquids. Finally, each coagulation value in the phase diagram was marked with the amount of nonsolvent in the polymer-solvent solution.",126
455,"Homogenous polymer dope solutions were prepared (15-25 wt% polymer in Polarclean(r)) at elevated temperatures between 30 degC and 60 degC. For membranes prepared with additives, 5 wt% of either Pluronic F-127 or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw=55 kDa) was added to the dope solution based on the total mass of the dope solution [additive /(additive + polymer + solvent)]. Detailed solution compositions are summarized in Table 1. The dope solution was cooled to ambient temperature (25 degC) and stored overnight for degassing. For membranes used for UF applications, the solution was cast on a glass plate. PET nonwoven sheets were used as supports for NF membranes to withstand the high pressures applied during the operation. A casting knife was purchased from Elcometer Ltd. (Manchester, UK), and the thickness of the cast membranes was fixed at 200 um. After casting, the membranes were immediately immersed in a coagulation bath (30 degC tap water) for 6 h for complete removal of residual solvents. Solidified membranes were stored in DI water at ambient temperature (25 degC) until used.",173
456,"The microscopic morphologies of membranes were observed using a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 10 kV. The membranes were sampled in liquid nitrogen and then sputtered with platinum for 90 s at 15 mA using a platinum sputterer (E-1045, Hitachi) prior to analysis.",47
457,"The pure water permeability of the membranes was measured by a multi-cell crossflow system with a surface area of 6.23 cm2 (Sepratek Ltd., Daejeon, South Korea). The water permeation process comprised the following steps: 1) membranes were wetted with EtOH for over 30 min to facilitate penetration by water; 2) wetted membranes were placed in a water permeation apparatus and pressurized to 1.0 bar for UF applications or 16.0 bar for NF applications; 3) the membranes were pre-compacted until the flux reached a plateau (approximately 5 h) to exclude the effects of compaction.",93
458,"BSA solution was introduced to measure rejection properties. First, 0.1 M sodium monobasic phosphate (PBS) solution was prepared to provide BSA solution in a stable environment, and then NaOH solution was added to adjust the pH to 7.0. The BSA solution was poured into the tank at a concentration of 1.0 g/L (BSA/PBS) after pre-compaction. Rejection experiments were performed using an in-house multi-cell cross-flow apparatus. Cross-flow velocity was set at 1000 ml min-1, and the rejection rate was measured after circulating 1 L of BSA solution at 1 bar for 20 min. The flux and UV signal (calculated using UV spectra (SPECORD 200, Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) of the permeate and retentate) were recorded and measured at the same time. The rejection rate was calculated using Eq. (1).(1)Rejection(%)=Co-CCox100where co and c refer to the concentrations of retentate and permeate, respectively.",140
459,"The overall porosity of the membrane was calculated using the following equation (Eq. (2)).(2)e=1-Mprpwxlxtwhere Mp and rp where and represent the polymer mass and density, respectively. w, l, and t are the width, length, and thickness of the prepared membranes, respectively.",41
460,"Tensile strength was measured with a Universal Testing Machine (UTM, AGS-J 500N, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature and a constant elongation rate of 10 mm min-1. The sample gauge length was 20 mm, and the elongation rate was 10 mm min-1.",42
461,"The thickness of each membrane was measured with a thickness gauge (ID-C112XBS, Mitutoyo Corp, Kawasaki, Japan). The contact angle was determined using an optical contact angle apparatus (Phoenix-300 Touch, SEO, Korea). Both thickness and contact angle were measured more than seven times at different locations for data reliability.",48
462,"The viscosity of the dope solution was measured by a viscometer (SV-100, A&D Company, Japan) to analyze the effects of additives in the polymer/PolarClean(r) system. The coagulation bath temperature was set to 30 degC for measurement and purged by dry air.",41
463,"The mean pore size and pore size distribution were investigated using a capillary flow porometer (CFP-1500-AE, Porous Materials Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA). Tests were carried out by a wet-up/calculated dry Darcy method using Galwick as wetting fluid and nitrogen as the flowing gas.",43
464,"To evaluate the surface porosity, SEM images were analyzed using open source ImageJ software, which can calculate multidimensional images. Through ImageJ, the black parts of the SEM image were perceived as surface pores, and automatic thresholding was used to convert the image to binary format. Surface porosity was calculated by averaging the results of measurements at different locations in the same membrane.",62
465,"According to the phase diagrams shown in Fig. 2, binodal curves with L-L separation instead of gelation or crystallization were clearly seen in the polymer (PES, PSF, and CA), solvent (PolarClean(r)), and nonsolvent (water) system, indicating that dope solution including PolarClean(r) and polymer tends to create pores on the membrane surface. However, the surface pore size of the membrane can vary depending on thermodynamic stability as represented by coagulation value. For instance, membranes produced using PES or PSF with PolarClean(r) that have relatively low coagulation values will have observable pores on the membrane surface and are therefore suitable for applications requiring more porous membranes such as UF. On the other hand, membranes produced using CA in PolarClean(r) that have high coagulation values have non-porous surfaces that are more appropriate for applications such as NF, RO, and gas separation.",138
466,"When preparing membranes through the NIPS process, the diffusion rates of the solvent and the nonsolvent are also crucial for determining membrane morphology. When the diffusion is intense only at the interface between the coagulant (nonsolvent) and the membrane surface, the resulting membrane has small pores on the surface and a porous sub-layer composed of finger-like macrovoids [41,42]. Thus, porous membranes can be prepared by controlling factors such as coagulant composition, coagulation temperature, polymer concentration, or by the addition of additives that control the NIPS process. We investigated the effects of additives and polymer concentration and characterized the resulting membranes in terms of pure water permeability (PWP), BSA rejection, and mechanical properties.",112
467,"Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of PES and PSF membranes prepared with different polymer concentrations (15-20 wt%). All PES membranes, regardless of polymer concentration, exhibited typical asymmetric NIPS morphology composed of a top layer with small pores and a porous macrovoid sub-layer (Fig. 3(a)), indicating that vigorous solvent-nonsolvent exchange occurred at the interface due to the high water affinity of PolarClean(r). PSF membranes displayed similar pore sizes as PES membranes, but the cross-sectional morphology was significantly different. As discussed in the context of the ternary phase diagram shown in Fig. 2, the PSF dope stability is lower than that of the PES dope solution, which enables PSF solution to achieve phase separation more readily. As shown in Fig. 3, PSF membranes from 15 and 20 wt% solutions had coagulation values below 1.1 and produced sponge-like structures (Fig. 3(b)), while PES membranes with coagulation values greater than 1.5 (Table S1) exhibited macrovoid structures (Fig. 3(a)).",154
468,"Polymer concentration also affected membrane mechanical strength, as shown in Fig. 4. The tensile strength of PES membrane was enhanced linearly from 2.83 +- 0.34 to 4.44 +- 0.12 MPa when polymer concentration increased (15-20 wt%). This increase in tensile strength is consistent with a general trade-off between tensile strength and overall porosity. In particular, the mechanical strength of the PSF membranes increased dramatically with increasing polymer concentration. These differences are due not only to the relatively low overall porosity of membranes, but also to the cross-sectional morphologies of membranes, as shown in Fig. 3. In fact, PES membranes exhibit macrovoids, whereas PSF membranes show bicontinuous morphology. As reported in previous studies [18,43,44], bi-continuous morphology is associated with greater mechanical strength compared to marcrovoidic morphology, which agrees with our findings that the mechanical strength of PSF membrane with bi-continuous morphology was greater than that of the macroporous PES membrane.",149
469,"Filtration performance also varied depending on initial polymer concentration. As predicted and described in Fig. 4(c), PWP of both PES and PSF membranes decreased as polymer concentration increased. PES membranes showed BSA rejection close to 100% regardless of polymer concentration, whereas PSF membranes exhibited rejection greater than 95% as polymer concentration increased from 15 wt to 20 wt%. This indicates that the mean membrane pore size of PES is smaller than that of PSF, and that pore size becomes smaller as polymer concentration increases.",84
470,"Since varying the polymer concentration did not create enough pores on membrane surfaces, pore-forming agents were employed in the dope solution. This is an effective method of generating membrane surface pores to improve water flux [32,45,46]. However, depending on the interactions between polymer, additive, and solvent, the additive may not act as a pore-forming agent. In some cases, use of an additive facilitates gelation of the polymer solution rather than inducing L-L separation, resulting in a denser membrane structure [33,47]. For this reason, we introduced two effective and widely-studied pore-forming agents: Pluronic F-127 for PES membranes [48] and PVP for PSF membranes [46]. These agents tend to increase dope instability and induce instantaneous demixing during the NIPS process. Since Pluronic F-127 and PVP have high water affinity, they remain well-mixed with water during phase separation, forming pores on the surface when immersed for membrane formation. In these experiments, PES and PSF membranes were prepared with additives at 5 wt% concentration and polymers at 15, 18, and 20 wt%.",168
471,"The viscosities of dope solutions prepared with and without additives are summarized in Fig. S1(b). As predicted, viscosity increased with inclusion of additives. Among the two additives, PVP (MW = 55 kDa) induced higher dope viscosity than Pluronic F-127 (MW = 12.5 kDa), likely due to its higher molecular weight. In addition to viscosity, membrane morphology varied depending on addition of additives, as shown in Fig. 5. According to cross-sectional SEM images, the prepared PES membranes exhibited similar membrane morphology with macrovoids, regardless of the addition of Pluronic F-127. On the other hand, when PVP was added to the PSF dope solution, it induced macrovoidic structures, indicating fast intrusion of water into the polymer matrix upon phase inversion. In addition, surface porosity increased in the presence of additives. The surface and cross-sectional SEM images shown in Fig. 5 clearly indicate pore formation by instantaneous demixing, preventing gelation in the dope solution when the instability of the solution was increased by additives in the PES and PSF solution in PolarClean(r).",169
472,"Structural variance caused by additives also affects membrane properties such as overall porosity, tensile strength, surface porosity, and water permeability. As summarized in Fig. 6(a) and (b), introducing additives as pore-forming agents influenced the overall porosity of the membrane, which is related to mechanical strength. PES membranes exhibited similar macrovoid structures even after Pluronic additive, resulting in similar tensile strength and overall porosity. However, PSF membrane morphology changed from sponge-like to finger-like structures with macrovoids after introduction of the PVP additive. This trend is illustrated in Fig. 6(b), which clearly indicates that the addition of pore-forming agents caused variation in morphology inside the membrane, which resulted in variation of both overall porosity and tensile strength.",115
473,"In addition, membrane water transport property, pore size, overall porosity, hydrophilicity, and surface porosity changed due to addition of additives. The effect of each additive was different, as summarized in Fig. 6. As described in Fig. 6(a, c, d), Pluronic F-127 increased the surface porosity and mean pore size of PES membranes while inducing a small increase in overall porosity. On the other hand, PVP 55 K increased the mean pore size, surface porosity, and overall porosity of PSF membranes.",80
474,"As shown in Fig. 6(e), the water contact angles were similar regardless of polymer concentration and inclusion of additive, indicating that increases in PWP are due to higher surface porosity, overall porosity, and mean pore size rather than membrane hydrophilicity. Interestingly, Fig. 6(f) suggests that the increase in PWP was more distinct in PSF membranes than in PES. Changes in the cross-sectional morphology of PSF membranes from bicontinuous to macrovoidic may have improved PWP at the cost of decreased mechanical properties. Macrovoidic structures typically exhibit low mechanical strength but superior permeability due to lower tortuosity and lower flow resistance [49,50]. Such structural transformations increase the overall porosity of membranes.",109
475,"Finally, the PES and PSF membranes showed similar rejection properties when produced with or without additives regardless of polymer concentration, indicating that additives did not change membrane pore size significantly.",30
476,"Unlike the preparation of porous membranes, fabrication of nonporous membranes requires a skin layer with smaller pores a few nanometers in size and a porous sub-layer for mechanical support. Therefore, intense diffusion at the interface of the coagulant and the membrane surface is essential. That is, gelation or vitrification should be favored over L-L separation and it advantageous for increasing the concentration of the polymer. For this reason, we applied high polymer concentrations of 20, 22.5, and 25 wt% without using additives.",82
477,"Fig. 7 illustrates the morphologies of CA membranes prepared using different polymer concentrations. Prepared membranes exhibit a dense skin layer on the surface with a porous, macrovoid-filled layer beneath the surface. The dense skin layer was formed due to the large polymer phase in the high-concentration solution, resulting in instant phase separation of the polymer at the interface of coagulant and polymer solution. After forming the dense skin layer, the exchange of solvent and nonsolvent at the interface becomes limited because the dense layer acts as a barrier. However, the high coagulation value of CA in PolarClean(r) delayed the instant demixing of the polymer phase, favoring gelation over L-L separation. The thickness of the skin observed in the SEM image in Fig. 7 was less than 1 um and was constant regardless of polymer concentration. However, as the polymer concentration increased, the PWP decreased and the rejection of mono/divalent ions increased, indicating that this formulation is applicable for NF applications (Fig. 8).",162
478,"Some membrane properties are known to be involved in trade-offs such as tensile strength versus PWP or PWP versus salt rejection [70]. In UF applications, it is crucial to achieve both high water flux and rejection properties due to the relatively large sizes of contaminants (>10 nm), but high tensile membrane strength is required without decreasing water flux. Separating target molecules, i.e., mono or divalent ions, in NF applications requires dense, tight surface structures, producing a trade-off between permeability and selectivity. Fig. 9 outlines the performances of the PES, PSF, and CA membranes produced in this study in comparison to previously-described membranes prepared using conventional solvents such as NMP and DMAc [70]. All three membranes examined in this study, PES, PSF, and CA, demonstrated competitive or superior performance compared to other membranes, near the upper bound in Fig. 9, indicating that high-performance UF and NF membranes can be prepared using environmentally friendly PolarClean(r) solvent. In addition, better performance may be achieved by further optimizing the preparation conditions. Changes in membrane preparation parameters including additives, surface modification, and thermal annealing will help improve membrane properties such as tensile strength, PWP, and salt rejection for use in UF and NF applications.",199
479,"In this study, UF and NF membranes were fabricated using an environmentally-friendly solvent, PolarClean(r), to investigate its feasibility in membrane preparation. PES, PSF, and CA were selected because they were the most commonly used polymers for membrane preparation during the past five years and are used in widespread industrial applications. A full characterization of their phase separation behaviors was first carried out to determine which polymers were suitable for applications such as UF or NF. Due to the different intrinsic affinities of different polymers with PolarClean(r), the resulting phase separation behaviors and membrane morphologies varied significantly. PES and PSF exhibited low solution thermodynamic stability in PolarClean(r) and produced a porous surface that was more suitable for UF applications, whereas CA produced a dense surface with smaller pores, suitable for NF applications because the phase separation of CA from PolarClean(r) was delayed due to high solution thermodynamic stability. The PES and PSF UF membranes and CA NF membranes exhibited competitive permselectivity. Our results indicate that PolarClean(r) is a promising alternative to conventional organic solvents such as DMAc, DMF, and NMP.",179

483,"Membrane-based water treatment requires membranes having good hydrophilicity [1-4] to allow water penetration and to alleviate the deposition of foulants. However, most membranes are prepared from polymers which are highly hydrophobic in nature, for example, polysulfone (PSf), polyvinyldifluoride (PVDF), polypropylene (PP), etc. To enhance the membrane hydrophilicity and fouling resistance, amphiphilic copolymers which are composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains are frequently incorporated into casting solutions as additives or modifiers for the preparation of microfiltration or ultrafiltration (UF) membranes via the process of nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) [5,6]. The principle for the use of the amphiphilic copolymers lies in that the hydrophobic segments are mixed with the membrane skeleton composed of the base polymers by chain entanglement whereas the hydrophilic ones are forced to segregate on the pore walls/membrane surface in the phase inversion process [7]. A long-standing surface hydrophilicity, and consequently enhanced permeability and fouling resistance are therefore expected as the hydrophilic chains migrated on the surface are not easy to leach out in operations because they are covalently bonded to the hydrophobic parts. Of course, this requires that the hydrophobic parts in the copolymer additives have a good compatibility with the base polymers.",196
484,"Amphiphilic copolymers with the hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains connected in the random [8], graft [9], and block [10-12] mode have been used for this purpose. For instance, triblock copolymers of hydrophilic polyethylene oxide (PEO) and hydrophobic polypropylene oxide (PPO) connected in the sequence of two end PEO blocks capping one PPO middle block, that is, PEO-block-PPO-block-PEO, are extensively used and are doped into the casting solutions of many different polymers and enhanced membrane wettability and fouling resistance are generally achieved [13,14]. However, the incorporation of the copolymer additives inevitably complicates the membrane manufacturing process, and even worse, it may unexpectedly change the phase separation process and possibly weaken membrane performances [15]. To minimize these issues, these copolymers are typically doped into the casting solutions with percentages less than 20% [8-14].",130
485,"Very recently, we blended amphiphilic block copolymer (BCP), polysulfone-block-polyethylene glycol (PSf-b-PEG), with PSf base polymer at various percentages up to 70%. We observed no compatible issue between the homopolymer and block copolymer as they were miscible at any blend ratio. Thus-produced blend membranes exhibited greatly improved performances in terms of permeance, hydrophilicity and fouling resistance. In addition to the surface segregation effect of the PSf-b-PEG copolymers, such superior performances are believed to be contributed also by the additional water permeability through PEG microdomains [16]. In this previous work, the PSf-b-PEG block copolymer was used with percentages up to 70% and they should not be regarded as additives any longer and actually they also served as one of the membrane-forming base polymers [16]. However, the PSf homopolymer was still involved as the other base polymers.",134
486,"The PSf-b-PEG block copolymer was provided by Nanjing Bangding. According to the manufacturer, the PSf block has a molecular weight comparable to that of Solvay P3500 polysulfone, and the PEG block has a molecular weight of ~20kDa. The weight ratio of the PEG block in the copolymer was determined to be 21% by thermogravimetry. PSf homopolymer (P3500) and PEG homopolymer (molecular weight=400Da) were obtained from Solvay and Sigma, respectively. Reagent grade N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, purchased from Sinooharm Chemical Reagent Co.) was applied as the solvent to dissolve the copolymer. We selected deionized (DI) water as the only component of the nonsolvent in the coagulation bath. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was dissolved in phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) to be used in the rejection and fouling resistance tests.",130
487,"The casting solutions of five different ratios in weight (ranging from 14% to 18%) were prepared by dissolving varying quantities of PSf-b-PEG in NMP at 60degC. It took several hours to ensure that the PSf-b-PEG was visually dissolved and then the solution of BCP was handled under mechanical stirring at room temperature for 4h so that PSf-b-PEG was completely dissolved in NMP. We kept the casting solutions in vacuum oven overnight to remove air bubbles. Subsequently, the copolymer solution was cast onto a nonwoven with a casting knife to obtain a casting film of 220um thick. The cast film was allowed to stand in air for 10s and then coagulated in DI water at room temperature. The prepared membranes were thoroughly washed with DI water and stored in water for use. Water was changed every other day to avoid the growth of microorganisms. To compare the fouling resistance, blend membranes of PSf and PEG homopolymers were also prepared. The two homopolymers were mixed together with 21wt% PEG and were dissolved in NMP with the total polymer concentration of 15%, and the following process for the membrane preparation is identical to the preparation of PSf-b-PEG membranes.",195
488,"Cloud points were determined by the titration of the casting solutions with a concentration of 15wt% different polymers, including polysulfone homopolymer and PSf-b-PEG copolymer in NMP, to which non-solvent, DI water, was added. The volume of the polymer solution is 10ml. The cloud point is defined as the added amount of DI water at which the liquid-liquid phase separation was visually observed and the precipitate did not redissolve at 60degC within 6h.",72
489,"Water flux as well as the retention to BSA was measured with a stirred filtration cell (Amicon Model 8010, Millipore). For retention tests, BSA was dissolved in the PBS buffer solution at the concentration of 0.5g/L. Retention rates for BSA were tested by measuring the concentrations of BSA both in the feed and permeate solutions using a UV-Vis spectrometer (NanoDROP 2000C, Thermo Scientific). The water flux J1 (Lm-2h-1) and the pure water permeability (PWP) were calculated using the following equations:(1)J1=VAxt(2)PWP=VAxtxDPwhere J1 represents the water flux (Lm-2h-1), V (L) is the volume of the pure water penetrating through the membrane, A is the effective membrane area (m2), t is the operation time (h). The BSA rejections of UF membranes were calculated by the following equations:(3)R=Cf-CpCfwhere Cp and Cf are the BSA concentrations (g/L) in the permeate and the feed solutions, respectively.",140
490,"Molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of the membrane was determined using aqueous solutions of dextrans with four different molecular weights including 10kDa, 40kDa, 70kDa, and 500kDa (The concentration was 2.5g/L, 1.0g/L, 1.0g/L, and 2.0g/L, respectively.). The concentrations of the dextran solutions were analyzed by GPC. Rejection values were plotted against the molecular weight of solutes in a curve. The molecular weight corresponding to 90% rejection was defined as MWCO of the membrane.",72
491,"The antifouling property of the membrane was determined by using the reported procedure [23]. The membrane prepared at 15% copolymer concentration was used to alternatively filtrate DI water and the BSA solution with a concentration of 0.5g/L for three cycles. We considered the membrane was fouled after the BSA filtration so we thoroughly washed the membrane with DI water at the end of every filtration with the BSA solution. The blend membrane of the PSf and PEG homopolymer was identically treated for comparison. The pure water flux of the cleaned membrane after three cycles of BSA filtration, J4 (Lm-2h-1), was tested and compared to the stable water flux in the first filtration of DI water, J1 (Lm-2h-1), to determine the flux recovery ratio (FRR). FRR can be calculated by the following equation:(4)FRR=J4J1x100%",132
492,"The PSf-b-PEG copolymer having a PEG weight ratio of 49% used in our previous work [16] in the preparation of PSf/PSf-b-PEG blend membranes was first explored in the present work to prepare a neat copolymer membrane. This copolymer formed homogenous casting solutions by dissolving in NMP which was readily precipitated in water, leading to solidified ""membranes"". However, these membranes exhibited a dense structure and no water permeation at all under the pressures up to 5bar. This can be explained by the slower phase separation of the casting solution as the high contents of PEG increase the affinity between the casting solution and the nonsolvent (water) which decelerates the precipitation of the copolymer solution. To solve this problem, we accordingly turned to PSf-b-PEG copolymers with a PEG content as low as 21wt% to ensure the formation of a porous membrane via the NIPS process. Moreover, PSf-b-PEG copolymers with such a lower PEG content are also desired as they will maintain the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the PSf homopolymer to a greater degree compared to the copolymers with higher PEG contents because PSf is much stable both mechanically and thermally than PEG [24].",193
493,"However, in the specific case of PSf-b-PEG block copolymers we discuss here, the change of the affinity between the casting solutions and the nonsolvent is also playing an important role. A higher PSf-b-PEG concentration means a higher content of PEG in the solutions which leads to an increased affinity between the solution and the nonsolvent. Introduction of PEG components into the casting solution increases the affinity of the nonsolvent and the casting solution. We measured the cloud points of PSf homopolymer and PSf-b-PEG copolymer in NMP solution. For 10ml solutions with a total polymer concentration of 15%, the cloud point for the PSf homopolymer solution was 0.71ml of water whereas the cloud point for the copolymer solution was 1.15ml of water, clearly indicating the delayed phase separation of the PSf-b-PEG copolymer compared to PSf homopolymer.",135
494,"We also examined the surface morphology of the membranes, and found that the top surfaces of the membranes prepared at different copolymer concentrations similarly took a non-porous, dense structure under SEM characterization (shown in Fig. S1).",36
495,"The excellent permeability of the PSf-b-PEG membranes should of course be ascribed to the enhanced hydrophilicity compared to the PSf homopolymer membranes as we discussed above. However, we do not think that a moderate increase in surface hydrophilicity will lead to such significant upgrade in water permeance. Moreover, similar improved hydrophilicity had also been frequently obtained in other works using different hydrophilic additives [33,34], however, significant enhancement in permeability like the present work is seldom obtained. Importantly, we attribute this superior permeability to the special microstructures originated from the microphase separation of PSf-b-PEG block copolymers.",95
496,"PSf is a strongly hydrophobic polymer whereas PEG is water-soluble and highly hydrophilic, therefore, there is a strong repulsion interaction between the two polymers, driving them to separate from each other. However, in their block copolymers, they two are covalently bonded together, and consequently their phase separation can only occur in the micro scale. The PEG block has a weight percentage of 21% and according to the phase diagram of block copolymers [17] they will form cylinder-like microdomains distributed in the matrix of PSf.",84
497,"To study the microphase-separated morphology of the copolymer in the membrane, we made TEM analysis on the microtomed membrane prepared at 15% copolymer concentration. To enhance the contrast of PSf and PEG phases under TEM, PEG domains were stained preferentially with OsO4. As show in Fig. 5, worm-like PEG domains appearing darker as a result of staining are present in the grey background which is the PSf matrix phase. This figure clearly shows the homogenous distribution of PEG microdomains in the membrane interior and no macroscale phase separation of these two blocks occurs, which is the particular advantage of block copolymer. The PEG microdomains have a diameter of approximately 20-30nm, and they are randomly oriented and three dimensionally interconnected with each other, forming a continuous phase distributed in the PSf matrix.",131
498,"These interconnected PEG microdomains serve as water channels in the filtration. PEG is highly water-affinitive and therefore, the PEG microdomains are highly water permeable as water molecules can transport along the solid PEG phases through mechanism, for example, exchange of hydrogen bonds [38]. As the PEG microdomains are interconnected water molecules can diffuse through the membrane following the pathway of the PEG microdomains. Therefore, the PEG microdomains deliver a function of water channels accelerating the transport of water in the membrane. In addition, the porosity in the membrane originated from the macrophase separation during the NIPS process still exists and allows water transport through the membrane. Due to the additional effect of water channels the PSf-b-PEG membranes exhibit much higher water permeance than other membranes which do not contain water channels.",131

502,"One better method to solve the above problem is to combine ionic liquids and solid substrate with the aid of immobilization. This method not only retains the catalytic activity, but also improves the recycling performance of ionic liquid. To satisfy the need for keeping enough activity of ionic liquids, some characters for solid support should be considered, just like higher surface area, porosity, physicochemical stability, and mechanical strength. Until now, many efforts had been done to immobilize ionic liquids on different support for catalysis, such as silica [28], metal ions, or nanoparticles [29], graphene oxide [30], polymer and so on [31]. These studies showed that the immobilized ionic liquid on solid support performs excellent catalytic ability and realizes the reutilization.",120
503,"In this work, we proposed one novel idea to immobilize acid ionic liquids onto polymer material to develop the catalytic membrane on the application of hydrolysis of biomass. Polysulfone (PSF) was adopted as a carrier to fabricate reusable supported ionic liquid catalytic membrane due to its excellent physical and chemical characters, coupled with good membrane forming. Firstly, PSF with various chloromethylation degrees (DCM) was synthesized by introducing chloromethyl into the benzene ring structure by chloromethylation reaction. Then, PSF-DG-ILs with different degree of the grafted ionic liquid polymer was successfully fabricated by loading acid ionic liquid on PSF-Cl via chemical bonding. Using PSF-DG-ILs as raw material, PSF-DG-ILs porous catalytic membranes with different degrees of grafted ionic liquid (DG-ILs) were firstly prepared by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The effects of DG-ILs and the blending polymer with various DG-ILs on membrane structures and properties of resulting membranes were systematically investigated. The prepared PSF-DG-ILs porous membranes were used to catalyze the hydrolysis of inulin, the temperature, inulin concentration, flux was studied. As far as we know, there is no literature reporting about using PSF-DG-ILs catalytic membranes for the application of inulin hydrolysis.",190

After dissolving, 2 g ZnCl2 was added and kept stirring 30 min under 40 degC. Then the temperature was increased to 60 degC. Chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME) was added dropwise by using a constant pressure dropping funnel and stirred for the predetermined time duration. After the reaction was completed, the solution was cooled down to room temperature. Then the mixture was slowly poured into a beaker containing 1200 ml of absolute ethanol with stirring for phase inversion. In this process, the white precipitate was formed. About 12 h later, the precipitate was filtered and washed by ethanol (95 wt%) for three times. PSF-Cl was successfully prepared and dried under vacuum at 50 degC for 24 h.",143
508,"PSF-Cl (10 g) and DMF (500 ml) were put into a 1000 ml three-necked flask and the mixture was stirred and dissolved with N2 inlet at room temperature. The desired dosage imidazole (molar ratio of active sites of PSF-Cl: imidazole = 1:5) was slowly added dropwise by constant pressure dropping funnel at 70 degC. After a reaction time of 20 h, a certain amount of 1,4-butane sultone (molar ratio of active sites of PSF-Cl: 1,4-butane sultone = 1:10) was added dropwise by constant pressure dropping funnel and reacted about 12 h under 70 degC. Then concentrated sulfuric acid (molar ratio of active sites of PSF-Cl: concentrated sulfuric acid = 1:10) was added slowly and stirred about 24 h at 60 degC. Finally, the solution was slowly poured into a beaker containing ethyl acetate and absolute ethanol (mass of ethyl acetate: absolute ethanol = 4:1) with stirring for phase inversion. About 12 h later, the precipitate was filtered and washed by ethanol (95 wt%). PSF-DG-ILs was successfully prepared and dried under vacuum at 50 degC for 24 h.

509,"Chemical characterization of the PSF, PSF-Cl, and PSF-DG-ILs was determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, VERTEX 80V, BRUKER, Germany). The spectra were conducted from 400 to 4000 cm-1. The polymers were evaluated at a 4 cm-1 resolution and 32 scans for each spectrum.",44
510,"The structures of PSF, PSF-Cl, and PSF-DG-ILs were characterized on 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer (Avance IIIHD, Bruker Avance, Germany). The degree of chloromethylation (DCM) is equal to the number of chloromethylation reactions per polysulfone repeating unit [46]. In the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the area (A) of the signal peak at 1.7 ppm represents 6 hydrogen atoms on two methyl groups on each polysulfone repeating unit, and A/6 is the area of the single hydrogen atom. The area (B) of the signal peak at 4.6 ppm represents two hydrogen atoms on CH2Cl, and B/2 is the area of the single hydrogen atom. The calculation formula of DCM is as follows:DCM=B/2A/6",112
511,"Similarly, the degree of grafted ionic liquid (DG-ILs) was calculated from the area of protons [47]. Concretely, the area (B1) of the peak at d5.3 ppm represents the two hydrogen atoms of -CH2- in -CH2-ILs, the area (C) of the peak at d7.8 ppm represents the two hydrogen atoms in imidazole, and the area (D) of the peak at d9.2 ppm represents one hydrogen atom in imidazole. Therefore, the area of a single hydrogen atom on an ILs can be expressed as B1/2 or C/2 or D. The average area can be represented as (1/3) (B1/2 + C/2 + D), which would equate to a single ILs. A/6 represents a single hydrogen atom in two methyl groups in each repeating unit of the PSF. The DG-ILs can be calculated by the following formula:DG-ILs=(1/3)(B1/2+C/2+D)A/6",133
512,"A certain amount of PSF-DG-ILs (the concentration was fixed at 16 wt%) and PVP (7 wt%) and PEG-600 (7 wt%) were dissolved in DMF (70 wt%) in a glass flask with stirring at room temperature.

After that, the casting solution was left overnight to remove the air bubbles. The specific compositions of casting solutions and membrane code are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

The cross-section prepared as follows: the samples were first put into liquid nitrogen with tweezers. About 20 s later, the samples were broken in the middle, and the non-woven fabric was cut by a blade. All the steps were done in liquid nitrogen.

The formula for calculating porosity is defined as:e(%)=Ww-WdrwAdx100%where e denotes porosity (%); Ww and Wd denote the weight of wet and dry membrane (g), respectively; rw is the density of water (g/cm3); A is the surface area of membrane (cm2); d is the membrane thickness (cm).",97
521,"To investigate the stability and recycling performance of the porous membrane, four cycles of hydrolysis were measured, and the hydrolysis operation of each cycle was the same as the above illustration. Moreover, the porous membrane was washed three times with deionized water and dried in an oven once every cycle. After four circles of hydrolysis, the porous membrane was immersed into 10 wt% H2SO4 about 12 h for regeneration. And then it was washed by deionized water three times and dried. The catalytic performance of the regenerated membrane was evaluated using inulin hydrolysis again.",94
522,"In order to confirm that the chloromethyl functional group and the ionic liquid were successfully grafted to the polysulfone, nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum (1H NMR) was performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Compared with Fig. 3 (a), an obvious characteristic peak appears at the position of d4.6 in Fig. 3 (b). This characteristic peak represents the chemical shift of the hydrogen atom on the -CH2Cl group connected to the benzene ring, which indicates that -CH2Cl has been successfully grafted to polysulfone [49].",86
523,"At the same time, the degree of chloromethylation can be determined based on the integrated area of hydrogen at this position [46]. As shown in Fig. 3 (c), a new characteristic peak appeared at d5.3, and the characteristic peak at d4.6 disappeared, indicating that -CH2Cl on PSF-Cl had completely reacted with ILs. Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks of d7.8 and d9.2 are mainly formed by the hydrogen of the imidazole cation [50]. In addition, the characteristic peaks in the range of d1.5-4.5 are mainly formed by -CH2 of 1,4-butane sultone. These characterization results prove that the ionic liquid has been successfully grafted to polysulfone.",103
524,"Infrared spectroscopy was adopted for further characterizing the chemical structure of PSF, PSF-Cl, and PSF-DG-ILs. The results are shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4 (B), the peak value of PSF-Cl mainly changes at 2800-3000 cm-1. The peaks at 2972 cm-1 and 2855 cm-1 are asymmetric stretching vibration peak and symmetrical stretching vibration peak of C-H on the methylene, respectively, indicating that -CH2Cl has successfully grafted to PSF after the chloromethyl reaction [51]. As shown in Fig. 4 (C), the characteristic peaks of PSF-DG-ILs at 3044 cm-1 and 1685 cm-1 are stretching vibration peaks of C-H and C = N on the imidazole ring respectively [52]. Moreover, the presence of a new peak at about 1025 cm-1 in the PSF-DG-ILs, which is ascribed to the symmetric stretch of -SO3H groups [53] Based on the above results, it can be concluded that the ionic liquid has been successfully grafted onto PSF polymer.",151
525,"The mechanical property of the membranes was an important factor for the actual application. In order to evaluate the mechanical strength of the membranes, a desktop electronic precision universal testing machine was used and the results are shown in Table 3. It is shown that the mechanical strength and strain ratio of membranes was decreased with the increasing grafted amount of ILs (from M0 to M4). After the grafted degree of ILs was raised to 0.59 (M5), the mechanical property was so poor that the membrane cannot be formed. This phenomenon will be further verified by the following SEM measurement. Theoretically, the higher the grafted degree of ILs, the better for catalytic performance. However, the grafted degree is too high to get a complete membrane. Therefore, under the consideration of membrane-forming and catalytic ability, we schemed a strategy that blending polymer with high and low DG-ILs, this maybe provide an effective approach to integrate the mechanical strength and catalytic performance. The data from Table 3 demonstrates that the mechanical properties of membranes can be raised effectively by blending.",178
526,"Based on the above preliminary identification of membrane physical strength, the blending strategy may be a great benefit to develop the membrane with high performance. However, the character of homogeneity for mixing polymer solution is a dominant factor to form the membranes.",42
527,"Thus, the polarizing microscope was used to observe the compatibility of the casting solution. Meanwhile, the photographs of dope solutions were taken with the aid of the camera. The results of the compatibility tests among various blending dope solutions are shown in Fig. 5.",44
528,"From the pictures, when PSF and PSF-Cl were blended with ILs modified PSF with the grafted degree of 0.59 (PSF-DG-ILs-0.59), respectively (Fig. 5 (L1), (L2)), the casting solution was turbid, and also particulate matters were very clearly presented in the casting solution under the microscope pictures. It is shown that they were incompatible. When PSF-DG-ILs-0.59 was blended with PSF-DG-ILs-0.25 (Fig. 5 (L3)), the casting solution was turbid, and significant phase separation can be observed. When PSF-DG-ILs-0.59 was blended with the polymer equipped with higher grafting degree, such as DG-ILs-0.31 (Fig. 5 (L4)), DG-ILs-0.35 (Fig. 5 (L5)), DG-ILs-0.42 (Fig. 5 (L6)) and DG-ILs-0.48 (Fig. 5 (L7)), the casting solution was clear, and the microscope pictures had no clear particle-like matters. Therefore, the results can be demonstrated that the composite dope solutions could exhibit better compatibility when the PSF-DG-ILs-0.59 was mixed with high DG-ILs of more than 0.31. The finding had a great guiding significance for the blending strategy using different DG-ILs.",160
529,"The microstructure of the membranes was observed by using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The surface and cross-section images of porous membrane just fabricated with single DG-ILs polymer are shown in Fig. 6. The results showed that porous structure can be seen on the membrane surface with the DG-ILs lower than 0.59, such as Fig. 6 (M1) and (M4). At the same time, the porous sponge structure can be observed. The result may be ascribed to the mechanism of mutual diffusion between the solvent and non-solvent during the phase inversion process [54]. And also the additives such as PVP and PEG-600 will more easily dissolve out from the polymer solution during the segregation process, this will be beneficial to get the porous membranes [55].",124
530,"In addition, the acid ILs equipped with hydrophilic sulfonated groups will also promote the mutual diffusion speed, which can be attributed to the segregation-induced mechanism [56]. The segregation phenomenon will provide more sulfonated active sites in the membrane pore structure. Without a doubt, this will be favorable to enhance the membrane catalytic performance. The surface segregation will be further verified during the following research. However, with increasing the amount of ionic liquid grafted on PSF, the mechanical properties of the membrane will gradually decrease (Table 3). Fig. 6 (M5) shows the pictures of the membranes with the higher degree value of DG-ILs (0.59), and the obvious cracks had appeared on the surface of the membrane. The results demonstrated that the mechanical strength of the membrane will be reduced with the increasing of the grafted amount of ILs on polysulfone. Thus, we adopted the blending method using the polymer with an appropriate high and low grafted degree as the solving strategy for further investigation.",163
531,"Based on the above results, the membranes were fabricated by blending the polymer with the different grafted amount of ILs, such as B1 denoted the mixing polymer with the DG-IL of 0.31 and 0.59, B4 denoted that with the DG-IL of 0.48 and 0.59. The corresponding SEM pictures were illustrated in Fig. 7. From all the pictures, it can be seen that there are no cracks on the surface of the membranes, and the resulted membranes exhibited the porous surface and sponge-like cross-section. The better membrane forming ability could be ascribed to the good compatibility of casting solution on the above study.",102
532,"The average pore size and porosity were measured and results are shown in Table 4. It is showed that the membrane pore size and porosity increased with the rising of DG-ILs of polymer (from M1 to M4). At the same time, the pore size and porosity were also improved by blending the polymer with a higher ILs grafted degree and more mass ratio. However, both pore size and porosity decreased when ethyl acetate was used as a coagulation bath. The results are in line with the SEM results.",88
533,"The surface property of the catalyst is another important factor, which is closely related to the attachment ability of the reactant. In this study, the membrane surface property was evaluated by contact angle measurement and the results were illustrated in Fig. 9. It can be concluded that the modified PSF membranes had a more hydrophilic surface compared with the un-modified PSF membrane. Simultaneously, the contact angles of membranes decreased with the increasing of the grafted amount of ILs, which was mainly ascribed to the hydrophilic sulfonated groups induced by acid ILs on the membrane surface and the membrane porous structure. The hydrophilic membrane material was expected to develop in this work. Because the hydrophilic property of the catalytic membrane will enhance the attachment opportunity of inulin on the membrane pores, which will improve the catalytic performance.",136
534,"Considering the above analysis, Fig. 12 illustrated the hypothetical diagram of the membrane-forming process based on a segregation mechanism when using ethanol as coagulation. This surface segregation will expose much more area of the catalytic sites during the hydrolysis process. Therefore, the ethanol coagulation bath will be more suitable to develop a membrane with high catalytic performance.",57
535,"Fig. 13 illustrated the hydrolysis performance of membranes with different DG-ILs. The results can demonstrate that the catalytic performance can be enhanced with the increase of DG-ILs. The TRS yield can reach to 80.15% when the DG-ILs was 0.48. This was mainly because the catalytic active site was increased by grafting more acid ILs on PSF membrane, which will effectively improve the catalytic performance. Therefore, just considering the catalytic activity, the more of the grafted ILs, the higher the catalytic performance.",81
536,"Actually, the mechanical strength of membranes will be reduced by increasing the grafted mount of ILs through the above results in Table 3 (M0-M4). Therefore, it could be concluded that there is a trade-off effect between mechanical strength and catalytic ability of membrane material. That is, when the catalytic ability increases the mechanical strength decreases, and vice versa. Coupled with mechanical strength and catalytic performance, we provided a strategy through blending polymers with a high and low grafted degree.",79
537,"The hydrolysis performance of blending membranes was investigated. And the results were illustrated in Fig. 14. From the figure, it can be described that the TRS yield can reach to 88.22% when blending the polymer with DG-ILs of 0.59 and 0.31 (B1). Compared with the highest catalytic performance of un-blending membranes (TRS yield = 80.15%), the blending membrane exhibited better hydrolysis performance. This phenomenon can also be explained by the surface segregation mechanism [59,60]. When ethanol is used as a coagulation bath, the ionic liquid is more likely to segregate to the interface between the polymer and the non-solvent due to the favorable distortion energy. The higher of the DG-ILs, the stronger of its segregation ability. Therefore, the PSF material with higher DG-ILs will more easily be segregated to the membrane surface and pore surface, which provides more active sites on the surface of the membrane and internal pores, thus the catalytic process showed the better performance after blending higher DG-ILs polymer.",162
538,"At the same time, the TRS yield was reduced by blending the polymer with higher DG-ILs. This phenomenon can be explained by membrane pore structure. The porous structure of the carrier ensures high catalytic performance. However, the higher porosity and larger pore size will also reduce the hydrolysis residence time and the contact opportunity of the feed with the active site. From the data in Table 4, it can be seen that the average pore size and porosity of blending membranes increased gradually as the DG-ILs was raised. Among them, the difference of the porosity of the four membranes was smaller, but due to the increase of the pore size, the inulin solution reduces the probability of contacting with the active site when passing through the pore channel, which will reduce the catalytic opportunity and thus decreases the TRS yield ratio.",141
539,"As shown in Fig. 15, the impact of the mass ratio of blending DG-ILs polymer on the catalytic performance of membranes was studied. The results showed that the TRS yield can be enhanced from 85.44% to 89.05% when the mass ratio of polymer with the high grafted degree (DG-ILs = 0.59) was increased. This was mainly due to that more active sites will be provided by more addition of polymer with high DG-ILs. In addition, the TRS yield of the B6 membrane can reach 89.02%, compared with the yield ratio of the B1 membrane (88.22%), the catalytic ability had a little improvement. However, the mechanical strength of the B6 membrane shown lower value compared with the B1 membrane. Therefore, considering optimizing the mechanical strength and catalytic ability, the B1 membrane was chosen for the following experiments.",136
540,"As shown in Fig. 17, the concentration of inulin has a significant effect on the hydrolysis of inulin. Fig. 17 (a) illustrated the yield of TRS vs inulin concentration. Meanwhile, the concentration of reducing sugar in the reaction system was measured and results were listed in Fig. 17 (b). When the concentration of inulin increased from 10 wt% to 40 wt%, the yield of hydrolysis decreased. Although the TRS ratio at the concentration of 10 wt% was higher than the others, the yield of reducing sugar was relatively low, which is unfavorable to the subsequent use of the reducing sugar product. Additionally, the hydrolysis rate of inulin will decrease significantly under the high inulin concentration (30 wt% and 40 wt%), which can be explained by the dissolution-diffusion mechanism. The inulin has a solubility between 6 wt % and 35 wt % at various temperatures [61]. When the concentration of inulin was increased to 30 wt %, it is difficult to completely dissolve into the water. Therefore, the rate of reaction was low. Moreover, high inulin concentration will increase the viscosity of the reaction system and the resistance of molecular diffusion, which is unfavorable to material transfer and reaction [62].",199
541,"The effect of flux on hydrolysis of inulin was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 18. Membrane flux determines the residence time of inulin solution on the surface and internal channels of porous membranes. When the membrane flux is reduced from 23.4 L/(m2*h) to 15.6 L/(m2*h), the TRS yield of the former is greater than the latter. Although the flux decreased and the residence time of the reactants on the membrane increases, some of the products and reactants will stay at the membrane surface and membrane pores, which will cover the active sites.",95
542,"The stability and recycling performance of the catalytic membrane was evaluated by four-cycle experiments, and the results were illustrated in Fig. 19. The TRS yields of each cycle were 88.22%, 79.57%, 65.86%, 54.02%, respectively. The yield ratio was decreased with the cycle times, which may be ascribed to the loss of anions HSO4- during the repeated hydrolysis process.",58
543,"In addition, the residual reducing sugar in the membrane may be set another obstacle by covering on the active sites, which will inhibit the reaction proceed, thus the decreased phenomenon of TRS yield will be illustrated [63]. However, the TRS yield can recover to 85.37% after regeneration using dilute sulfuric acid, which means the catalytic activity of the porous membrane could be recovered.",63
544,"Through the above evaluation, the novel developed catalytic membrane exhibited a better reusable character, which will be meaningful to the biomass conversion.",22
545,"Although the catalytic membranes have attracted wide attention in many fields, the research on the application of catalytic membranes to hydrolyzed biomass is still rare. Table 5 illustrated this work and other researches on biomass hydrolysis. By comparing with the reaction conditions of other catalysts, it can be found that the catalytic membrane of this work shown better hydrolysis efficiency under the relatively lower temperature and shorter reaction time. In general, the catalytic PS-ILs catalytic membranes, which was fabricated by blending the ILs-grafted PSF polymers with high and low ILs grafted degree, exhibited a promising application in the field of catalytic hydrolysis of biomass.",104
546,"In this work, the novel acid ILs-functional PSF polymers and corresponding catalytic membranes were developed and employed to hydrolysis of inulin. The feed passes through the rich network-like pore channels of the catalytic membrane by forced flow filtration operation mode, which strengthens the internal mass transfer and the contact between reactants and catalytic sites, while in the internal pore channels of porous polymer monolith, reactant entry and product departure are in diffusion mode with great mass transfer resistance, especially for the molecular chains of polymer reactants.",86
547,"The ILs graft-modified PSF was evaluated by FTIR, 1HNMR, which demonstrated that ILs has been successfully immobilized on the PSF polymer. Then the new porous catalytic membranes were fabricated by the NIPS method using the PSF-DG-ILs polymer. The results showed that the membranes combined the catalytic activity and membrane forming ability. And the catalytic performance can be improved by choosing the ethanol solution as a coagulation bath, which was mainly ascribed to surface segregation of ILs induced by interaction force between the hydrophilic groups of ILs and ethanol. Furtherly, by investigating the compatibility, membrane forming, physical-chemistry property, and catalytic ability, a new finding was shown that the catalytic membrane can break the trade-off effect between the membrane mechanical strength and catalytic capability by mixing PSF-DG-ILs polymers with high and low DG-ILs. Specifically, the polymer with a low degree of grafting serves as the frame structure to ensure the mechanical strength of the membrane, while the polymer with a high degree of grafting enhances the catalytic performance due to the segregation of ILs onto the wall of the pore channel during the NIPS process.",183
548,"Moreover, the membrane formed by blending polymers with DG-ILs of 0.31 and 0.59 demonstrated the optimized mechanical stress and catalysis performance. And the TRS ratio of inulin hydrolysis can reach 88.22% with 20 wt% concentration of inulin at 75 degC with a flux of 23.4 L/(m2*h). Through measuring the stability and recycling performance of the catalytic membrane, the results demonstrated that the novel fabricated ILs grafted PSF membrane exhibited a good recycling character. Based on this study, we innovatively provide one novel catalytic membrane and its fabrication method, which could balance the catalytic activity and membrane mechanical property. This membrane will have a promising potential application in the field of biomass conversion.",112

552,"In order to secure adequate water resources and clean water supply for human life, the remediation of oily wastewater produced by manufacturing industries is one of the most critical challenges nowadays [1]. So far plentiful functional materials with selective wetting properties have been developed to treat oily wastewater, especially the oil/water emulsion [2-13]. However, efficient separation of surfactants-stabilized highly emulsified oils from water is still challenging attributable to the high stability and tiny droplet size (< 1 um) of this oil existence form. Besides the insoluble oils, practical industrial sewage water usually also contains complex contaminants such as water-soluble organic dyes, which are endangering the aquatic ecosystems and public health [14,15].",111
553,"The drawbacks of the dual-functional separation membranes designed by coupling super-wettability for oil/water separation and photocatalytic degradation for dyes removal lie in the need of external light irradiation and a long photocatalytic treatment time. Moreover, the small organic molecules incompletely degraded from dyes would still cause secondary pollution of water [23-26]. For membrane adsorption/removal of water-soluble dyes by electrostatic interaction during filtration process, the separation performance strictly depends on the dye type and pH of discharged water, which hinders the common use of the dual-functional membranes for treatment of wastewater containing different dyes [27]. To address the above deficiencies, it is urgent to develop a facile, versatile and environmentally friendly strategy to preparing functional membranes with integrated separation performances for one-step removing highly emulsified oil droplets and non-specific organic dyes.",130
554,"All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Polysulfone (PSF, Mw = 3500), bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mw = 67000) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

Deionized (DI) water was produced by a lab-scale ultrapure water system (Master-Q).",124
555,"PSF UF membranes with a typical asymmetric structure were prepared by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method according to previous work [38]. Afterwards, the as-prepared PSF membrane was immersed in PA solution for 300 s and then rinsed with DI water for several times to remove the PA molecules weakly bonded on the membrane surface. Subsequently, the PA-treated PSF membrane was soaked in FeCl3 aqueous solution (0.04 M) for 60 s. A tremendous amount of water rinsing was then performed to remove the FeIII ions weakly bonded with the PA molecules. The above sequential modification process is denoted as one cycle and the modified PSF membranes are denoted as PA-FeIII/PSF. We varied the immersion time in PA solution (0 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, 240 s, and 300 s) and the cycle number (1, 2, 4, and 6 cycles) for achieving optimal coating parameters.",148
556,"The pure water permeation (PWP) and BSA rejection of the membranes were determined by a stirred dead-end filtration setup (Amicon Model 8050, Millipore) with an effective test area of 13.4 cm2 at a pressure of 1 bar as illustrated in Fig. S1. The PWP (L/(m2*h*bar)) was evaluated as follows:(1)PWP=VAxtxPwhere V is the volume (L) of pure water passing through the membrane, A is the effective test area of membrane (m2), t is the test time (h), and DP is the operation pressure (bar).",83
557,"In the test of protein retention, BSA was dissolved in phosphate buffers (pH = 7.4) at a concentration of 0.5 g/L. The BSA rejection was calculated as follows:(2)R=Cf-CpCfx100%where Cf and Cp are the BSA concentration in the feed solution and permeate solution, respectively.",43
558,All the results were the average of three test values.,10
559,"To investigate the emulsion separation performance of the PA-FeIII /PSF membranes, we selected several oils with different polarity parameters including petroleum ether, cyclohexane, n-hexane and n-tetradecane. The surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions were prepared by mixing oil and water at a volume ratio of 1: 99, together with 0.01 g/L tween-80 added. Afterwards, the mixtures were sonicated for 120 min to obtain a homogeneous turbid dispersion.",64
560,"The dynamic emulsion fouling test of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane was evaluated by filtration setup with n-tetradecane-in-water emulsion as the feed solution. The PWP of the membrane was initially measured for 1 h until a steady-state flux (J0) was achieved. Then deionized water was substituted by emulsion and the permeate flux (Jp) was measured for 1 h. Afterwards, the membrane was cleaned with ethyl alcohol and water under magnetic stirring each for 10 min. Then the pure water and emulsion were permeated for another a 2-h recovery test. The recovery flux (JR) was measured every 10 min. The antifouling property of the membranes was evaluated by flux recovery ratio (FRR) under operation pressure of 1 bar. The FRR was calculated by the following equation:(3)FRR=JRJ0x100%",123
561,"The dyes rejection efficiencies of pristine PSF and PA-FeIII/PSF membranes were evaluated using various water-soluble dyes (MR, MO, MeB, RhB, MB and CR; 10 ppm) in the aforementioned filtration setup. Type, molecular weight and maximum absorption wavelength of the organic dyes are summarized in Table S1. The dye removal efficiency, R (%), was calculated according to formula (2), where Cf and Cp are the dye concentrations in the feed solution and permeate solution, respectively. For further studying the long-term stability of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane, we adopted MB and CR solutions (10 ppm) in continuous 6-h filtration tests. The water flux and dye rejection were recorded at a time interval of 1 h.",112
562,"Composite wastewater containing surfactant-stabilized n-tetradecane-in-water emulsions (1 vol%) together with ORO (5 ppm, soluble in oil) or CR (10 ppm, insoluble in oil) was used as the model sewage. In cyclic experiments, 30 ml of model wastewater was permeated through the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane under a water intrusion pressure of 1 bar. A magnetic stirring at 200 rpm was conducted to minimize the concentration polarization on the membrane surface. The membrane was alternatively rinsed with ethyl alcohol and water after each separation.",81
563,"PA is a natural and nontoxic plant constituent with very close six phosphonic acid groups in one PA molecule, which are capable of covalent bonding with -OH groups on the substrate surface. Previous studies have verified that the high density of phosphonic acid groups could facilitate the adsorption and immobilization of PA molecules on various hydrophilic substrates and even on moderately hydrophilic polymers such as polycarbonate [34] and polyethylene terephthalate [36]. At room temperature the anchored PA molecules practically bond with several metal ions, forming coordination complexes in minutes. Especially in the company of metal ions like FeIII that can crosslink the PA, a network layer comprising insoluble aggregations will be generated on the substrate. For the moderately hydrophilic PSF UF membrane in our case, the improved surface roughness is believed to be derived from the deposition of the PA-FeIII lamella sediments by the sequential assembly process.",147
564,"The ATP-FTIR spectra of the pristine PSF membrane and the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane are exhibited in Fig. 2a. In general the highly identical spectral profiles hint that the sedimentary PA-FeIII layer on the membrane surface is extremely thin, the signals of which are overlapped by the PSF substrate. In both the spectra, the peak at 2972 cm-1 is attributed to the symmetric C-H stretching vibration. The peaks at 1583 and 1487 cm-1 are assigned to CC stretching mode of the quinoid rings and the benzenoid rings, respectively. The peak at 1012 cm-1 corresponds to SO symmetric stretching vibration [39]. Nevertheless, compared to the pristine PSF, we can observe a broader and stronger vibration band centered at 3380 cm-1 for PA-FeIII/PSF due to the presence of abundant -OH groups originating from the PA-FeIII complex [40].",133
565,"In view of the considerably increased BSA rejection rate after optimized deposition of the PA-FeIII complex aggregations, we further tested MWCO values of the pristine PSF membrane and the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane with the best UF performance [45]. Fig. 4a exhibits the corresponding MWCO curves referring to dextran of various molecular weights. According to 90% dextran rejection, the MWCO value of the PSF membrane is determined as 140 kDa, while the value of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane significantly declines to 19 kDa. The corresponding effective pore size of the membranes was calculated as around 24.6 and 8.09 nm in diameter, respectively. This conclusion agrees well with the aforementioned image analysis of the average pore size, indicating the potentials of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane in efficient rejection of smaller organic solutes.",127
566,"Dynamic water-wetting and oil-repelling tests were further performed on the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane. As displayed in Fig. 5a, a water droplet spread to a nearly zero water contact angle within 5 s, reflecting outstanding surface wettability. In the dynamic underwater oil adhesion test shown in Fig. 5b, an oil droplet (n-tetradecane, 3 mL) was forced to adequately contact the membrane surface. Then the needle was gradually lifted up. During the lifting process, the oil droplet maintained its orbicular shape with almost no deformation or residuum. This observation indicates that the oil droplet could overcome the adhesion force to depart from the membrane surface. Additionally, UWOCAs above 150deg were achieved for a series of test oils including petroleum ether, cyclohexane, n-hexane and n-tetradecane (Fig. 5c), which confirmed the versatile underwater superoleophobicity of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane for oils with different surface tensions and viscosities. The excellent underwater superoleophobicity and oil-resistance properties of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane are beneficial to high-performance oil-in-water emulsion separation [47].",160
567,"We further evaluated the antifouling performance of the PA-FeIII/PSF UF membrane by a cyclic experiment involving sequential filtrations of pure water and highly emulsified n-tetradecane. Fig. 6c presents the time-dependent flux and separation efficiency of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane under UF operation with alternating fouling/washing steps. After the initial operation of pure water for 1 h, the permeation flux of the membrane dropped noticeably from 87.4 to 34.3 L m-2 h-1*bar-1 attributable to compaction of the solid polymer induced by mechanical deformation under a trans-membrane pressure difference. In the following separation of oil-in-water emulsions, the flux gradually decreased with time, which hinted the formation of an oil cake on the membrane surface. However, the flux of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane almost recovered its initial flux after washing with ethanol and water each for 10 min. The FRR was 71.2% in the first cycle and 72.6% in the second cycle. The gradual retardation of the flux reduction with the cyclic operation suggests that the fouling of oils could be limited by the coating of the PA-FeIII complex aggregations. Moreover, subjected to the three cycles of UF filtration of highly emulsified n-tetradecane, the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane maintained excellent separation efficiency higher than 99.8%.",198
568,"During the filtration process, the concentration of oil droplets on the membrane surface increased rapidly and the surfactant-stabilized oil droplets would gradually demulsify under the external driving pressure. The oil droplets were easy to spread on the pristine PSF membrane surface with high oil-adhesion tendency and accumulate into a dense fouling layer. The tiny surface pores were thus quickly blocked and no permeation flux was gained. Whereas, the phosphonic acid groups on the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane surface had good hydration ability. A large number of water molecules could also be trapped into the nanoscale voids in the rough PA-FeIII complex layer. The strong repulsive force between polar (water) and non-polar (oil) molecules effectively promoted the oil droplets to detach from the surface and restrained the fouling of the membrane.",128
569,"For excluding the effect of electrostatic adsorption, the anionic dyes CR and MB were selected as model organic dyes for investigating the long-term separation performance of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane. As shown in Fig. 7b and S8, the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane exhibits excellent separation performances for both the dyes subjected to 7-h continuous filtration. The rejection rates for CR and MB measured at each time point are above 96% and 80%, mainly by the size screening effect. The gradually declined fluxes for both the dye solutions are typically resulted from the cake resistance.",91
570,"To investigate the simultaneous purification ability of the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane toward highly emulsified oils and dyes, composite wastewater containing surfactant-stabilized n-tetradecane-in-water emulsions (1 vol%) together with ORO (5 ppm, soluble in oil) or CR (10 ppm, insoluble in oil) was used as the model sewage. Fig. 8a, b presents the digital images of the turbid dye/oil-in-water emulsions (a2, b2) converted from the initial dyed oil-water mixtures (a1, b1) as well as the filtration setup in operation (a3, b3). A transparent colorless filtrate was collected in each case. Fig. 8 (a4, b4) shows the UV-vis spectra of the feed and permeate solutions, in which the characteristic absorption peaks of n-tetradecane and dye (ORO or CR) were hardly observed after the separation process.",121
571,"We demonstrated the feasibility of the PA-FeIII complex coating in modifying asymmetric polymer UF membranes for desired wettability, separation performances and reusability. In the case study we presented, a bifunctional PA-FeIII/PSF membrane with superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity was achieved by controlled aggregation of crosslinked PA-FeIII complexes. We revealed that PA-FeIII complex aggregations could form a compact and rough layer on the PSF membrane surface even through 1-cycle sequential assembly. The combination of the suitable surface roughness and superhydrophilic compositions in the coating layer imparted the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane with outstanding wettability and oil-repellency properties. The molecular layer deposition mode of the PA-FeIII compact film also enabled a fine adjustment of the pore aperture. The PA-FeIII/PSF membrane was confirmed feasible to efficiently separate various highly emulsified oil-in-water emulsions containing smaller oil droplets. Compared to the pristine PSF membrane, the PA-FeIII/PSF membrane also exhibited much higher rejection rates for various low-molecular organic dyes merely by size sieving. This work provides a simple, rapid and versatile approach to simultaneous removal of small-sized emulsified droplets and non-specific low-molecular organic dyes from water, which is expected to be of technological significance for sophisticated oily wastewater decontamination.",190

577,"The physico-chemical interaction between membrane surface and foulants in an aqueous solution can normally be revealed using the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (XDLVO) theory which contains the attractive Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW), Lewis acid-base (AB) and electrostatic repulsive double layer (EL) interactions (Hoek and Agarwal, 2006; van Oss, 1993). However, this theory can only be used to quantitatively calculate the interaction energy between two infinitely flat surfaces. Many microalgal shapes are spherical or elongated, and many membrane surfaces are rough and/or patterned (Lin et al., 2014; Marbelia et al., 2016b). An improved theory, the Derjaguin approximation, has been developed to quantitatively deal with the physico-chemical interactions between a spherical microalgal cell and a flat membrane surface (Wang et al., 2014).

Before filtrating the microalgal broth, the membrane was first stabilized using deionized water with a maximum pump speed of 0.015 m/s at 2.5 bar for 6 h until the CWP leveled off. The patterned membranes were fixed with the pattern lines perpendicular to the flow direction. The critical pressure (CP, bar) was determined using a stepwise method (Bilad et al., 2012a; Zhao et al., 2020b). Briefly, the filtration was carried out at a cross-flow velocity of 0.015 m/s and initialized under a pressure of 1 bar. After every 2 h, the pressure was increased by 0.5 bar until the maximum pressure of 2.5 bar.",140
593,"The Reynolds number (Re) of the feed flow in the cross-flow system was calculated using Eq.

595,"All experiments were carried out three times, and the results were expressed as mean values+-standard deviation. The significance of the results was analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 17.0 and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with least significant digit (LSD) analysis (P<0.05).",43
596,"Considering that the surface energy and interfacial forces between the membrane surface and microalgae are related to the membrane and microalgae intrinsic properties, only F-sNIPS, F-NIPS and F-PSf membranes were used for calculation. F-sNIPS membrane was prepared using the same casting solution and phase inversion method as for the patterned membranes, which can be used to reflect the patterned membranes surface properties.",62
597,"To calculate three energy components (LW, EL and AB), the surface tension parameters/components (g) should be determined. The total tension parameter (gTot), including LW (gLW) and AB (gAB) components (Van Oss et al., 1986), can be calculated using Eq. (12), which can also be calculated using the extended Young equation (EYE) by testing the contact angle using three probe liquids (Li et al., 2014). The EYE can be expressed as Eq.

599,"The DS and IEC of the resulting sPSf in current study are 71% and 1.4 meq/g, respectively, indicating a high degree of sulfonation and a relatively high hydrophilicity (Song et al., 2016). sPSf with 71% DS is not water-soluble, preventing sPSf from leaching out from the membrane during phase inversion and filtration. To verify the successful incorporation of sPSf in membranes, FTIR was used. The spectrum (Fig. 2) shows a small characteristic peak at ~1041 cm-1, which corresponds to the symmetric stretch vibration of the S = O bond in the sulfonic acid group, indicating the successful incorporation of sPSf in the blend membrane.",104
600,"The cross-sectional morphologies of the patterned membranes are shown in Fig. 3, showing a typical asymmetric structure with finger-like macrovoids with a remarkable triple-layered structure. The dense skin layer is thicker in the valley than at the apex (Fig. 3), indicating that the fluxes at the apex may be higher than in the valley. The possible reason is that the phase inversion process in the valleys is different from that at the apex as out-diffusing solvent mixes with a smaller amount of non-solvent, which is present and stagnant in the valley than on top of the patterns (Fig. 4). As the spraying nozzle covers a width of around 6 cm, and the volume of sprayed water is 3.6 mL/s at a casting speed of 2.5 cm/s. The theoretical corresponding sprayed non-solvent thickness is then about 660 mm (assuming a flat surface). This amount of water is enough for the initial solidification. However, as the volume of water in the valley is less than on the apex, the skin layer properties change along the exact position on the waves (Holda and Vankelecom, 2015). A similar result was found in a previous study (Zhao et al., 2020b).",195
601,"After introducing sPSf into the membrane, the membrane surface hydrophilicity and negative charge increased significantly (Table 1) (i.e. the water contact angles and ZPs of the F-sNIPS and F-NIPS membranes were lower than those of the F-PSf membrane), indicating the antifouling potential for microalgae harvesting.",45
602,"A velocity path line profile near the membrane surface was obtained using CFD modeling (Fig. 8). The red color represents a higher velocity, and the blue color a lower. For patterned membranes, the velocity at the ridge region is higher than in the valley region, confirming the results in 3.2 that two different flows occurred near the membrane surface leading to a high-velocity on the ridge and a low-velocity in the valley. Small vortices were found in the bottom of the valley regions, which can alleviate microalgal cell deposition by mixing and scouring effects (Ma et al., 2015). A linear streamline is found near the flat membrane surface with a relatively low velocity, confirming a constant flow behavior. The results are in line with previous studies in which activated sludge particle and microalgal cells depositions were mitigated by using patterned membranes compared with the corresponding flat membranes under low Re number conditions (Lee et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2020b).",160
603,"A contour line profile was used to present the wall shear on the membrane surface (Fig. 9). The red color represents a higher wall shear, and the blue color a lower. With a higher wall shear, the fouling can be better alleviated (Du et al., 2017). Like the velocity profile, the wall shear at the ridge region is higher than in the valley region, confirming the results in 3.2 that an enhanced wall shear at the ridge region can give patterned membranes more channels to pass water. The wall shear on the flat membrane surface is too low to show, indicating that the wall shear on the flat membrane surface may be not high enough to remove the fouling, resulting in a serious cake layer on the flat membrane surface and a lower membrane flux. Similar results were found in previous studies, in which sludge particles and microalgal cells were detached from the ridge of the patterned membranes with enhanced shear, while a flat membrane surface was fully covered by sludge and microalgal cells (Lee et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2020b).",182
604,"The CFD modeling clearly shows the advantage of using patterned membranes for harvesting microalgae. However, no significant difference is found between different pattern shapes, indicating that flow behavior may not be the main reason which influences the filtration performance.",39
605,"Combing the results from 3.1 and 3.2, the patterns in the flow channel act as turbulence promotors, which can generate high velocity and wall shear on the ridge, and vortices in the valley. This can hinder microalgal cell attachment on the membrane surface, and in turn reduce fouling (Du et al., 2017). In addition, the wave patterns give a relatively larger un-fouled contact area in microalgal broth, which allowed more clean water to pass through, in turn resulting in a higher membrane flux and CP.",85
606,"The effects of pattern shape on the morphology and filtration performance of negatively charged PSf membranes was investigated to harvest microalgal biomass. By adding sPSf to the PSf membrane, the hydrophilicity and surface charge were enhanced. In cross-flow filtration, all patterned membranes showed a higher CP, and wave-patterned membranes showed the highest CWP and flux in microalgal broths with 100% harvesting efficiency.",62
607,"The mechanism of alleviating fouling for patterned membranes to harvest microalgae was unraveled based on the membrane-cell interaction energy using the improved XDLVO theory, showing a higher repulsive energy when incorporating sPSf, thereby proving the fouling alleviating property of sPSf containing membranes. CFD modeling showed a higher velocity and shear stress on the apexes, indicating that the patterns can provide areas with less-fouling to allow more water passage.",68

610,"Global production of oily wastewater has continued to grow in recent decades due to the exponential development in industrial activities. Oily wastewater is an environmental and human hazard because of its toxicity [1,2]. Numerous contemporary efforts including physicochemical and biological practices have been long employed for treatment of oily wastewater effluent with various oil sizes and dispersion types. Mechanical coalescence and gravity-based settlement are the simplest and most frequently explored methods. In addition, applied techniques of photocatalytic treatment, sand filters, demulsification, electrostatic and electrochemical processes, as well as flotation are described [3,4]. Nevertheless, reports show that these methods are costly and produce a surfeit of waste sludge production. Recently, the interest in the design and utilization of membrane technologies for oily wastewater has drawn significant attention as a more cost-effective approach to address this critical issue [5].",137
611,"Exceptional advantages of membrane-based separation methods include their practical scalability, high selectivity, low energy demand, ease of operation, efficiency, low maintenance costs and small footprint. However, the performance of popular filtration methods is critically threatened by membrane fouling, which not only results in drastic permeance declines and reduction in the quality of treated water, but also lowers membrane lifespan due to frequent cleaning during long-term operation in practical wastewater treatment [6]. The identification of suitable materials with desirable properties is considered to be of utmost importance for the development of high-performance membranes [7].",93
612,"Polymer-inorganic mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) are defined as polymeric materials filled with synthetic and non-synthetic components to boost their physical and chemical properties [8]. MMMs have opened up countless new exploration opportunities due to their capacity to transcend the trade-off between permeability and selectivity along with alleviating membrane fouling during wastewater treatment applications [9]. Polymer-inorganic MMMs are an excellent combination of both the distinct membrane formation capacity of the polymer and the unique properties of inorganic additives such as super-hydrophilicity, mechanical and thermal resistance, and anti-toxicity. Some of these additives include graphene oxide (GO) [10], titania (TiO2) [11,12] and silica (SiO2) [13].",101
613,"The hydrophilicity aspect of MMMs is a paramount characteristic frequently sought after for oily wastewater treatment, as it contributes to the wettability and hence the ultimate antifouling performance of a membrane [14]. Hydrophilicity, in this case selective hydrophilicity, ensures that the oil droplets do not adhere and penetrate the surface through specific wetting characteristics towards water and oil [15]. Size exclusion is another key factor. While water droplets will be allowed to penetrate, oil droplets that are larger than the membrane's pores will be restricted from permeating [11].",88
614,"Of the different oil droplet sizes, that is, emulsified oil (<20 mm), sprayed oil (20 >= 150 mm) and free oil (>150 mm), the filtration of emulsified oily wastewater has taken centre stage as it is the most challenging to eliminate [16]. Consequently, the majority of MMMs have been designed for the treatment of oily wastewater target emulsions, with each seeking to achieve an equilibrium between the sieving effect and antifouling properties [17,18]. For example, Ikhsan et al. [19] designed MMMs with halloysite nanotube ferric oxide NPs as the inorganic fillers for the rejection of emulsified crude oil of up to 1000 ppm in water. They reported ideal antifouling properties coupled with high retention performance. Most recently, Saini et al. [13] also fabricated ultrafiltration (UF) MMMs by integrating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA)-grafted SiO2 (SiO2-g-PEGMA) NPs for the rejection of emulsified oil among other foulants. They also reported enriched antifouling properties and, although the membrane demonstrated good performance with the retention of other foulants, the rejection of oil was still recorded at high rates (89%).",181
615,"Notwithstanding these successful outcomes, MMMs present a trade-off: obtaining the desired morphological properties whilst maintaining a stable and even distribution of beneficial additives without compromising performance. Considering previously cited examples, Ikhsan et al. [19] encountered low porosity challenges due to the incorporation of high nanofiller concentrations (>13.04 wt%) within the membrane matrix, thereby compromising on permeance. Conversely, for Saini et al. [13] the nanofillers increased the MMM porosity; however, increased NP content (>0.5 wt%) resulted in pore blockage and a subsequent decrease in the bulk porosity of the membranes. The challenge is therefore to obtain a suitable balance between the additives and polymer concentration, which will not only contribute towards the formation of a desired membrane morphology but also improve the performance of the resulting membranes [12,14,20].",127
616,"One of the most promising and widely used nanomaterials are TiO2 NPs. They present numerous benefits such as superior hydrophilicity [11,21], high thermal resilience [22,23], improved permeability [24], and increased porosity [25,26]. More importantly, they are readily available [7,27] and are stable in water and therefore easily integrated either through embedding or coating in thin films for water purification [28,29]. Our previous research on a blend of polyethersulfone (PES)/sulfonated polysulfone (SPSf) proved it to be a suitable system for the fabrication of durable porous UF membranes [10,30,31]. Specifically, the combination of hydrophilic SPSf with PES resulted in improved performance of the membranes in regards to water permeability and wettability [30]. Furthermore, the potential for the utilization of the PES/SPSf blend system was expanded by Hu et al. [10] after integrating sparse amounts of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets (up to 0.0016 wt% into 18 wt% polymer). Results showed that the polymer chains readily interacted with the nanosheets, which led to the formation of UF MMMs with improved antifouling activity and water permeance capacity.",172
617,"The aim of the current study was to prepare PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs using a simple non-solvent induced gelation phase inversion technique (NIPS). Briefly, small amounts of water were integrated into the casting solutions during preparation as non-solvent additives to induce gelation phase separation. This technique enabled the polymer solution to move closer to the binodal, thus aiding in the formation of a sponge-like framework. Then, to achieve suitable membranes for oil-in-water emulsion separation, the effect of TiO2 NPs at different concentrations on the morphology and performance of the membranes was assessed. Accordingly, PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs with different polymer concentrations were fabricated to tailor the relationship between the pore structure and the requisite properties during oil-in-water emulsion separation at different oil concentrations (100, 300 and 900 ppm). Viscosity measurements, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used to confirm the rheological impact of the NPs in the various solution systems, while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) plus field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were utilized to confirm morphological influences.",169

Contact angles for each specimen were measured five times to achieve an average value.",74
632,"The performance of the membranes was tested using a laboratory assembled cross-flow system to measure the water permeance. The membranes were first compacted by passing deionized water at 0.2 MPa until a stable flow rate was recorded. In this case, this was achieved in 1 h, largely because spongy membranes, especially in the presence of inorganic fillers such as TiO2, do not compact much. After compaction, the pressure was decreased to 0.1 MPa and the water flow rate was recorded, this time for the purpose of calculating water flux. The water flux was then divided by pressure to get pure water permeance Jw1 (LMH bar-1) using Eq. (3) as follows:(3)Jw1=VA Dt DPwhere V is the permeate volume (L), A is the operative membrane area (m2), t is the filtration time (h) and P is the applied pressure (bar).",138

A membrane was first used in the pure water filtration system and then transferred to the filtration set-up where fouling occurred. After each emulsion filtration phase, the fouled membrane was washed using backwashing with deionized water. Afterwards the pure water permeance of the 'clean' membranes was calculated using Eq. (3) and denoted as Jw2. The entire process encompassed three cycles. One cycle included a pure water filtration phase and an emulsion separation phase and then cleaning.",93

642,"Compatibility and thermodynamic behaviour of the casting solution is a key parameter for obtaining desirable polymeric membranes. Fig. 1 presents the viscosities of the polymer solutions versus TiO2 NP concentration and polymer concentration. Evidently, the viscosities of both series of solutions increased with increasing TiO2 concentration and polymer concentration. For example, the viscosities of the casting solutions with a constant polymer concentration of 22 wt% rose linearly from 2490 +- 235 mPa s to 9010 +- 405 mPa s with increasing TiO2 NP concentration from 0 to 0.15 wt%. A similar upward exponential trend was also observed for the MMMs containing a similar NP concentration and varying polymer concentrations: there was a 92% increase in viscosity from 1460 +- 152 mPa s at 18 wt% polymer to 18940 +- 708 mPa s at the highest polymer concentration of 28 wt%.",140
643,"These results demonstrated that the significant difference in the rheological properties of the casting solutions was strongly related to the interaction of the TiO2 NPs with the polymer chains. On the one hand, intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions between SPSf/SPSf and PES/SPSf polymer chains occurred in the PES/SPSf/TiO2 casting solution [10]. On the other hand, the added TiO2 NPs induced intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions between the -OH electron donor groups of the TiO2 NPs with PEG, and the -SO3- groups of the SPSf polymer chains with water molecules (in TiO2 aqueous dispersion). These strong interactions inhibited the mobility of the polymer chains, leading to increased viscosity of the casting solutions [32]. Additionally, a higher polymer concentration in the casting solution meant that the polymer chain interactions and chain entanglements became stronger, resulting in higher viscosity [12]. In a casting solution, the key parameters dictating the phase separation process during formation of the membrane are the polymer composition and concentration, which directly influence the viscosity. This subsequently contributes to the double diffusion rate of non-solvent and solvent during phase separation, eventually affecting the morphology and performance of the resulting membranes [20].",189
644,"The stability of casting solutions over time was used to support the above observations, as shown in Fig. S2. It was proposed that if the interactions between the polymer chains and the components were not strong, phase separation would occur [10]. The solutions were monitored at room temperature (25 +- 1.7 degC) and did not now any significant change in physical appearance during the first week (Fig. S2 (a)), nor in the fourth week (Fig. S2 (b)); that is, there was no phase separation. Due to the cloudy and opaque nature of the solutions, it was not possible to view micro-aggregations; therefore, solutions were further tested by observing the viscosity behaviour under different shear rates.",115
645,"First, it can be observed from Table S1 that the viscosity of all the casting solutions containing NPs decreased with increasing shear rates, which is an intrinsic property of non-Newtonian fluids. However, M0 displayed Newtonian behaviour during week 1: 0.01 s-1 at 2480 +- 184 mPa s; 0.025 s-1 at 2490 +- 235 mPa s; and, 0.05 s-1 at 2490 +- 139 mPa s) [12]. Less shear thinning was observed at low concentrations of either NPs or polymer (M1, M2, M3 and M5), but it increased at higher concentrations (M4, M6, M7, M8 and M9). This was a positive indication that the NPs interacted with the polymer chains and influenced their mobility [30]. Finally, the rheological behaviour of the casting solutions was similar after four weeks, suggesting that any micro-aggregations formed would have been dispersed by the shear rates, thereby maintaining the shear thinning effect [36].",146
646,"To investigate the formation of hydrogen bonds between the NPs and polymer solution, Raman and attenuated total reflection (ATR) FTIR spectral analyses supported by MD simulations were conducted. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the C-S stretching peak decreased slightly in wavenumber (red shift) from 1154 cm-1 (pristine membrane) to 1153 cm-1 (MMMs). This observation was attributed to hydrogen bonding between TiO2 NPs and SPSf, which caused -SO3- group electron cloud deformation and thereby decreased the frequency of the C-S vibrations. Similar findings were observed by Hu et al. [10] with the addition of GO nanosheets to PES/SPSf and Ly et al. [37] while blending PES with malachite NPs. The presence of TiO2 in the casting solution was also confirmed by the appearance of a peak at 517 cm-1 for (Fig. 2 inset) characteristic for Ti-O stretching [38].",137
647,"Additionally, ATR-FTIR spectra were generated for the PES/SPSF/TiO2 casting solutions, the pristine casting solutions and the TiO2 NPs. These further corroborated the interaction of TiO2 NPs and the polymer chains, as illustrated in Fig. S4. The TiO2 NPs spectrum depicted three distinct bands. The most prominent band, spanning ~3000-3500 cm-1, was ascribed to the O-H groups. The sharp peak at 1645 cm-1 was attributed to the Ti-O bonds [39]. Spectra from the pristine as well as the MMMs casting solutions displayed various peaks for the characteristic functional groups. First, the presence of -OH groups was indicated by the broad peak from 3300 to 3700 cm-1. The alkyl (-CH2) group resulted in a sharp peak at 2800-2900 cm -1. Finally, characteristic absorption peaks for the -SO3- groups in the SPSf polymer chains were observed at 1147 cm-1, while vibrations of OSO functional groups in PES were seen from 1082 to 1103 cm-1 [32,40].",152
648,"A magnified and detailed examination of the band stretch arising from the O-H group (~3300-3700 cm-1) in the ATR-FTIR spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. This band attested to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the TiO2 NPs and the polymer chains. After the addition of TiO2 NPs to the MMM casting solution, the FT-IR O-H band of the MMMs displayed corresponding changes in intensity, shifts in peaks and the formation of new peaks, compared with the O-H band of the pristine casting solution (Fig. 3). This confirmed the effective formation of hydrogen bond interactions between O-H groups in the TiO2 NPs with functional groups (such as -SO3-) of the polymer chains. These linkages constricted the movement of the polymer chains, consequently increasing the viscosities of the casting solutions, as previously observed.",132
649,"In brief, MD simulation analysis of RDF supported the experimental findings, including from spectroscopic analysis. Hydrogen bonding ensured the confinement and retention of NPs within the polymer matrix. This enabled the casting system to maintain good stability and uniform distribution of TiO2 NPs, and inhibited the agglomeration of polymer chains, ultimately leading to the enhanced hydrophilic properties.",57
650,"Particle shape and size are important properties to consider because they control the particle distribution. Compared with polyhedral nanomaterials, globular nanomaterials have fewer points of contact between each other, which aids in the reduction of aggregation and thereby improves dispersion [43]. The NPs used in the fabrication of the PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs had a mean particle size of 19.0 nm, as shown in Fig. S1. The TEM micrograph of the same shows that the NPs were well distributed with almost no aggregation; this indicated good dispersibility, which was also aided by the initial distribution of TiO2 in water. Vatanpour et al. [44] identified that there should be good correlation between particle size and concentration. It was found that the TiO2 NPs with a particle size of 20 nm displayed the best performance in comparison to smaller (8 nm) and larger (up to 25 nm) sized particles. The smaller particles had very high aggregation due to their larger specific surface area and antiparticle tension. Conversely, larger particles -despite having a high surface affinity for water due to their increased surface area -accumulated on the pore walls due to poor dispersibility, especially at higher concentrations [44].",193
651,"Therefore, for the resultant membrane to have a uniform distribution within its matrix, it was imperative to ensure a homogenous dispersion during membrane formation. An inhomogeneous NP dispersion would contribute to severe agglomeration in certain regions within or on the membrane. This would have serious negative impacts as the membrane would exhibit inconsistent properties and have unstable performance during the filtration process due to uneven selectivity [45].",67
652,"To investigate the impact of TiO2 filling on the porous structure of PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs, SEM micrographs were used to investigate their cross-sectional morphology, sublayer structure and surface morphology. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that all the MMMs possessed fully sponge-like sublayers with thin, dense skin layers. The thickness of the skin layers increased with increasing NP concentration (M0 - M4). At first, only a slight increase in thickness was observed: the dense skin layer between M0 to M3 was below 2.0 mm; however, as the concentration of the NPs increased to 0.15 wt% in M4, the thickness of the dense layer increased to 3.1 +- 0.2 mm.",109
653,"Additionally, it can be observed from Fig. 5 that the density of the interstitial spaces of the MMM sublayers became thicker as the NP concentration increased. Simultaneously, the average pore size of the MMMs gradually decreased from 46.3 +- 2.7 nm (M0), 45.4 +- 1.5 nm (M1), 44.7 +- 0.9 nm (M2), 44.3 +- 2.5 nm (M3) to 42.5 +- 1.6 nm (M4), as shown in Table 3. The pores in the sub-layer dominated the bulk pore size and hence the average pore size was normally larger than the calculated surface pore sizes [46]. Similarly, when the NP concentration was increased to 0.075 wt%, the surface porosity also increased (13.1 +- 1.2%), but then decreased upon further addition of the NPs at concentrations of 0.1 wt% and 0.15 wt% (11.3 +- 0.6% and 10.2 +- 1.8%, respectively) as a result of more filler NPs.",144
654,"In the subsequent increasing polymer concentration series (MMMs M5 - M9), a similar trend in the development of dense skin layers and sponge-structured sublayers was observed, as shown in Fig. 6. That is, as the polymer concentration increased, so did the thickness of the dense layers. For example, the thickness of the dense layers increased gradually from 0.9 to 2.4 mm with an increase in the polymer concentration from 18 wt% (M5) to 26 wt% (M8). M9 exhibited the thickest dense layers at 3.5 +- 0.2 mm. In this series, the increase in density of the interstitial spaces in the MMMs as the polymer concentration increased was more pronounced compared to in the increasing NP concentration series. Furthermore, Fig. 6 also shows that the pore sizes of MMMs M5 - M9 gradually decreased: the average pore size of the MMMs declined from 43.3 +- 1.6 nm in M5 to 34.3 +- 2.6 nm in M9 (Table 3). Similarly, the surface porosity and bulk porosity of M5 - M9 mostly declined with increasing polymer concentration (Table 3).",176
655,"As previously discussed, viscosity is a crucial factor that affects the kinetics of the liquid-liquid phase separation process, which is related to membrane formation behaviour. Increased viscosity in casting solutions leads to a prolonged activation time for phase separation caused by the higher degree of saturation at the beginning of the phase separation process [20]. This results in decreased diffusion exchange rates as it takes longer for the polymer to precipitate, and ultimately generates membranes with dense skin layers and sponge-like sublayers [47].",83
656,"The hydrophilic NPs also play the role of pore formers by being points of nucleation and growth [10]. Hence, in membranes with increased viscosity such as M3 and M4, increasing NP concentration caused relatively higher surface porosities and surface pore sizes [48]. Additionally, the increase in surface porosity was also influenced by -SO3- groups in SPSf. The hydrophilic nature of the -SO3- groups decreased the chemical potential difference between the polymer solution and coagulation bath (H2O). Thereby, for the surface layer--which was in direct contact with the non-solvent-phase separation occurred at higher non-solvent concentration, resulting in polymer-poor centres which became pores. The higher the concentration of SPSf or the casting solution, the more pores were observed in M6 and M7. However, at higher polymer concentrations (M8 and M9) the formation of thicker dense layers would have slowed the diffusion rates and, consequently, the growth of nuclei [49].",147
657,"More importantly, the preservation of a fully sponge-like structure in all the membranes was promoted by the interaction between SPSf, water (as a non-solvent additive) and PEG (1 kDa) in the casting solutions [30,32]. Water molecules formed hydrogen bonds with -SO3- groups from SPSf, as confirmed using MD simulations, thereby inducing gelation. Consequently, chain mobility during phase inversion was decelerated leading to the suppression of macrovoids while PEG, being a weak coagulant, enhanced pore formation and connectivity resulting in the formation of a sponge structure [50].",86
658,"In addition to increased viscosity, instantaneous hydrogen bond formation between the TiO2 NPs and the polymer chains assisted in the stable and even distribution of the NPs within the M2 framework, as shown in Fig. 7. EDX was employed to establish the state of TiO2 NP displacement in M2, as illustrated in Fig. S5. The red dots indicate the presence and distribution of Ti within the nanocomposite network. The obtained images confirmed that the NPs were homogeneously dispersed throughout the membrane system, with close examination revealing the slight migration of NPs to the top layer of the membranes. This was due to migration of the TiO2 NPs before the polymer film solidified, as their hydrophilic nature caused them to be drawn towards water, which was the non-solvent during phase inversion [12].",131
659,"The mechanical stability of a membrane is dependent on its morphology and characteristics. As illustrated in Table 3, there was an increasing trend in tensile strength and elongation with increasing TiO2 NP concentration, which was in good agreement with SEM analysis and viscosity analysis. Specifically, M4 displayed the best mechanical performance of 6.0 +- 0.4 MPa. This trend was also observed for the MMMs with increasing polymer concentration from 18 wt% (M5) to 28 wt% (M9), with M9 having the highest modulus of 7.9 +- 0.2 MPa. The superior mechanical performance of M5 - M9 was attributed to their sponge-like frameworks and dense layers that increased in rigidity and density with increasing polymer and NP concentration.",116
660,"In addition, the increased mechanical strength was suggestive of properly established intermolecular and electrostatic interactions through hydrogen bonding between the nano-additives and the polymer matrices [44]. As evidenced from FT-IR analysis and MD simulations, TiO2 NPs covalently bonded with the polymer chains by forming hydrogen bonds with SPSf functional groups. The NPs served as linkers with the polymer chains, resulting in increased polymer rigidity. Therefore, the energy required to disrupt these strong hydrogen bond interactions between TiO2 and the polymer chains was increased, subsequently leading to an improved modulus [10,32].",90
661,"Hydrophilicity is an inherent characteristic of materials that exhibit affinity for water; that is, materials that tend to water-wettability [5]. Hydrophilicity is also a key regulating aspect of membrane fouling as it dictates affinity between oil droplets in an emulsion and the membrane. It is the surface chemistry that can allow a membrane to be readily wetted by water, thereby forming a hydration layer on their surface [51]. A hydration layer is pivotal for the filtration performance of an UF membrane as it hinders the adhesion of foulants to the membrane surface, thereby minimising the fouling propensity [32]. Water contact angle provides important insights on the surface wettability of a membrane to water. The static water contact angle of the membranes (Fig. S6), confirmed that all the MMMs were hydrophilic; that is, a contact angle <90deg [24]. M0 displayed the highest water contact angle of 64deg, and the water contact angle declined steadily upon addition of increasing concentrations of TiO2 NPs to the membranes: 61deg (M1), 59deg (M2), 57.5deg (M3) and 55deg (M4). For MMMs in the increasing polymer concentration sequence, the water contact angle varied slightly between 58deg and 60deg from membrane to membrane.",195
662,"Regardless of their hydrophilicity, the dynamic water contact angle assessment gave insight into the wettability behaviour of the membranes beyond the surface as a function of the removal rate of water. The dynamic water contact angle for each membrane was evaluated for 100 s. Fig. 8 shows that the removal rates of the membranes changed markedly from one membrane to another. To illustrate, it took 100 s for the contact angle of the pristine membrane (M0) to decrease from 64deg to roughly half the value (36deg), whereas it took M1 (22 wt% polymer concentration and 0.05 wt% TiO2 NP concentration) 60 s to absorb an approximately equivalent volume of water (from 61deg to 36deg). And, for M4 (22 wt% polymer concentration and 0.15 wt% TiO2 NP concentration), the water droplet was almost completely drawn in within 30 s (18.5deg).",139
663,"Ideally, the major factors affecting the removal rate -the time for a droplet of water to pass through the membrane cross-section- are the wettability of the membrane surface and its internal pore channels, and the pore sizes [52], these are determined by the casting composition and membrane morphology. M2-M4 (0.075-0.15 wt% NPs) possessed particularly high porosities (both surface and bulk). This contrasted with membranes with low porosities such as M7, M8 and M9, which had water contact angles at 100 s of 31deg, 34deg and 35deg, respectively, thereby indicating slower removal rates despite their apparent hydrophilicity.",96
664,"In the MMMs, enhancement of membrane hydrophilicity as well as surface and internal porosity was due to the even distribution of TiO2 NPs within the membranes together with the spontaneous segregation of polymer chain hydrophilic groups (such as -SO3-) at the surface interface during formation [28]. Furthermore, embedded TiO2 NPs formed preferential pathways for water to pass through as they imparted -OH groups on the pore walls, resulting in the higher water affinity of the MMMs [10]. After morphology, hydrophilicity also makes a substantial contribution to the filtration performance of a membrane as it not only boosts the permeability to water, but also increases the antifouling activity of a membrane.",110
665,"Asymmetric membrane morphology impacted pure water permeance in two different ways. One was due to the increase in polymer concentration and the other was as a result of increasing NP concentration, as shown in Fig. 9. First, the increasing NP concentration presented an increasing-decreasing pattern. The peak of this trend was M2 (0.075 wt% NP concentration), which showed an optimum permeance value of 555.2 LMH bar-1 in comparison with more porous M3 and M4 (0.1 wt% and 0.15 wt% NP concentration, respectively) which recorded pure water permeance values of 541.8 and 472.5 LMH bar-1, respectively. This was because M3 and M4 had thicker dense skin layers and lower surface porosities than M2. However, as seen with other aspects of the membranes, the MMMs in general outperformed the pristine membrane which had a permeance of 377.7 LMH bar-1.",137
666,"To further demonstrate the efficacy of the improved morphology in the MMMs arising from TiO2 addition, pure water permeance was also determined for the MMMs containing increasing polymer concentrations. The pure water permeance of the MMMs gradually decreased from 710.4 to 254.6 LMH bar-1 with an increase in polymer concentration from 18 wt% to 28 wt%, as shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, even with thicker membranes it was possible to obtain relatively high permeance in M7, M8 and M9 (394.1, 346.5 and 254.6 LMH bar-1, respectively).",86
667,"The previous discussion has systematically proven that the MMM morphology is suitable for water transport. This was because of their sizeable pores, reasonable porosity and -most importantly-the additional polar groups on the surface and pore walls due to the addition of TiO2 NPs, which increased the hydrophilicity of both the surface and the internal pores of the membranes [24]. Comparable observations were made by Hosseini et al. [12] upon addition of TiO2 NPs to PES membranes.",76
668,"The oil rejection performance of the MMMs was determined based on emulsion separation at different oil concentrations, as depicted in Fig. 10. The MMMs showed increasing emulsion rejection with increasing oil concentration in the feed. The highest rejection rates obtained with M2 were 61%, 72% and 90% for emulsions containing 100, 300 and 900 ppm oil, respectively. Additionally, at these oil concentrations, M2 exhibited a high feed permeance of 516.5 LMH bar-1, 424.7 LMH bar-1 and 311.4 LMH bar-1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 11 (a). Rejection of the feed emulsion obtained using M9 was up to 80%, 82% and 95% for emulsions containing 100, 300 and 900 ppm oil, respectively. As shown in Fig. 11(b), M9 displayed the least feed permeance (243.2 LMH bar-1, 221.5 LMH bar-1 and 171.9 LMH bar-1 for 100, 300 and 900 ppm oil, respectively) of the MMMs with increasing polymer concentration. This trend corresponded to that observed for pure water filtration.",157
669,"The observed rejection and filtration performance of the membranes was ascribed to two effects. First, the effect of morphological attributes of decreased mean pore size and porosity, coupled with an increasing selective dense top layer, were observed. The effect of these properties was confirmed by the high rejections (>90%) and decreasing feed permeance of M7, M8 and M9. Accordingly, membranes with high porosity and large pores, for example M3 and M4, showed slightly lower rejection and lower feed permeance despite having relatively thick dense skin layers. Adham and co-workers [53] made comparisons between membranes with varying pore sizes in reference to permeation flux and retention capacity, and made similar observations: a larger pore size resulted in increased permeate flux and diminished retention capacity. Second, the increment in hydrophilicity of the membranes owing to the integration of TiO2 NPs also enhanced the permeation of water by weakening the interaction with foulants [13].",151
670,"The stability of the emulsions was assessed by measuring their properties and droplet sizes after seven days. The properties of the oil-in-water emulsions remained relatively unchanged over the seven day period (Table 2), and it can be seen from Fig. S8 that they maintained a high oil droplet frequency despite the droplet sizes of the 300 and 900 ppm emulsions increasing in size. The stabilisation of the oil droplets in water for long periods was due to the surfactant (SDS), which reduced the interfacial tension between the water and the formed droplets and thereby decreased coalescence [2].",97
671,"Permeation and emulsion separation treatment results of the PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs fabricated in the current work were compared to those from contemporary membranes presented in the literature (Table 4). It can be seen that the PES/SPSf/TiO2 membranes, particularly M9 demonstrated significant high performance in both permeance and rejection.",47
672,"The antifouling ability of a membrane can be assessed by quantifying the fouling parameters PDR and PRR. PDR reflects the proportion of fouling on the membrane after each emulsion filtration phase, and PRR describes the total irreversible fouling ratio after all the phases. Therefore, a good antifouling performance would be represented by a low PDR and a high PRR [35]. PDRirr is critical in antifouling analysis as it characterizes the ratio of foulants that adhere to the surface and the pores of the membranes at each emulsion filtration phase and cause a decline in the permeance even after cleaning.",99
673,"In the current research work, the antifouling performance was found to be dependent on both surface morphology (surface pore size) and hydrophilic properties. For example, according to PRR and PDR results in Fig. 13, M2 and M5 had the highest PRR values (89.5% and 85.7%) and the lowest PDRirr at 1.9% and 2.0% respectively, indicating good antifouling performance. These two membranes also recorded the highest values of PDRt (43.7% and 46.0%) and PDRr (41.8% and 44.0%). Various research works have established that membranes with large pores are prone to a higher degree of fouling resulting from pore blockage. However, due to the improved hydrophilicity of the MMMs' surface and pores a large number of the oil droplets would not adhere and could be easily dislodged during cleaning i.e. reversible fouling [35].",131
674,"Further illustrating, membranes with small pores such as in M8 and M9 exhibited lower PRR (80.6% and 74.8%) and higher PDRirr rates (10.1% and 6.9%) in comparison to other MMMs. This is because despite the removal of oil droplets during crossflow filtration, oil droplets eventually wet and foul the surface of the membrane due to pressure, thereby causing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface, and consequently the permeance, to decrease [5]. In the same manner, it would be challenging to dislodge oil droplets trapped within small membrane pores during cleaning. Overall PES/SPSf/TiO2 MMMs were found to have better antifouling properties than the M0 (pristine membrane), which had severe irreversible fouling (13.8% PDRirr) owing to its lower hydrophilic properties.",118

680,"Amphiphobic membrane is regarded as one of the most special anti-wetting states, considering the fact that most solid surface could easily be wetted by organic liquids owing to their quite lower surface tension than water [1-4]. The expansion of application domain of membrane technology makes them be faced with not only mild water solution but also more complex compositions including organic solvents (alcohol, acids and benzene etc.), enzymes, serum proteins, surfactants or nonpolar oils etc [5-9]. As a promising desalination technology, MD is one of such separation processes that need highly anti-wetting and anti-fouling properties to guarantee the single permeation of water vapor and high salt rejection. However, the membranes commonly used in MD were solely hydrophobic, which were easily wetted and contaminated by organic substance in concentrated brine, causing the intrusion of liquid phase into membrane pores and the decrease of salt rejection [10-12]. Thus the amphiphobic membrane was recently developed to overcome the wetting and fouling issues caused by organic medium.",163
681,"To fabricate amphiphobic solid surface, a special re-entrant surface feature was firstly proposed by Tuteja et al. [13,14], since then which has been the essential element to synthesis amphiphobic surface in conjunction with low surface energy substance. Numerous methods including dip-coating, photolithography, etching and thermal reaction were developed to create various re-entrant structures such as inverse-trapezoidal structure [15], mushroom-like structure [16], labyrinth-like structure [17], pompon-like structure [18], and chip-like structure [19] etc. These etching or deposition based methods showed advantages in creating highly regular and accurately controllable surface feature, yet were unsuitable for porous polymeric membranes based on the following reasons: (i) special requirement in instruments and difficulty in large-scale preparation; (ii) the harsh preparation conditions or strong corrosive medium was limited to stiff metal solid; (iii) the membrane porous structure was easily destroyed during etching or depositing process. Accordingly, developing mild and convenient technology to construct re-entrant structure for amphiphobic polymeric porous membrane is in urgent need.",158
682,"The current work aimed to construct such re-entrant texture via NIPS process. Inspired by the networks created by electrospinning nanofiber membrane, the bicontinuous inter-connected porous structure, which is a typical membrane structure obtained through optimizing the phase separation parameters [27], was proposed to provide re-entrant structure for the first time. In detail, the bicontinuous structure was prepared via the addition of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and was exposed on bottom surface via delayed liquid-liquid phase separation process. SiO2 nanoparticles were in situ grown via sol-gel procedure to provide the second level re-entrant texture. After the fluorosilane dip-coating treatment, amphiphobic PSf membrane with highly resistance to water and organic liquids was ultimately prepared. The anti-wetting and anti-fouling properties of resultant membrane during MD process were investigated and it was found that the constructed re-entrant structure could offer sufficient concave space to prevent further wetting of the liquid droplets.",147

Deionized water (DI water) was used throughout the experiment. PVDF flat sheet membranes (GVHP, Millipore, USA) were used as control samples.",99
684,"Further roughening treatment was performed on the pristine PSf membrane. The interpenetrating network structure provided a primary re-entrant structure. A secondary re-entrant structure was obtained by creating SiO2 nanoparticles via a simple dip-coating process. TEOS (75 mL) and ethanol (75 mL) were stirred to form a homogeneous mixed solution (referred to as liquid A); ammonia water (6 mL), DI water (14 mL) and absolute ethanol (80 mL) were stirred to form a homogeneous mixed solution (referred to as liquid B). The pristine PSf membrane was immersed in liquid A and B in sequence for 1.5 h and 0.5 h, respectively. The uniform SiO2 nanoparticles were in situ created on the pore wall of the PSf membrane after the hydrolysis condensation reaction under 65 degC for 0.5 h. Membranes with different SiO2 nanoparticles dimensional distribution and densities were represented as SX@PSf-P5.",140
685,"Fluorination modification was carried out by using the long-chained fluoroalkylsilane FOTS to reduce surface energy of SiO2@PSf membrane. FOTS solutions were prepared by dissolving FOTS in ethanol with concentration of 6% (v/v). The SiO2@PSf membrane was immersed into FOTS solution at room temperature to uniformly introduce fluoroalkylsilane onto membrane surface. Finally, FOTS coated membranes were treated at 65 degC in an oven for 2 h to initiate cross-linking reaction between fluoroalkylsilane monomers. Resultant membrane was marked as F-SiO2@PSf. Hydrophobic PSf membrane was also fabricated as a control using PSf membrane without SiO2 nanoparticle as the secondary re-entrant structure as pristine substrate. The whole fabrication procedures involving 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 were illustrated in Fig. 1(a).",115

687,"Contact angle (CA) of liquid droplets with different surface energy (DI water, ethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, hexadecane and hexane) on resultant membrane surface was measured using a contact angle goniometer (CA-100C&D, Shanghai). The volume of the measured droplets was 5 mL. For each sample, the contact angles were measured at five different locations and then averaged. Different corrosive liquids (HCl, NaCl and NaOH aqueous) were used to measure the liquid repellency stability of the as-prepared PSf membrane under harsh chemical environment. Mechanical stability of micro-nano structure was also performed by using ultrasonic treatment for a period of time. SEM morphology and liquid contact angle of membranes were further studied to observe the effect caused by ultrasonic treatment.",117

691,"In order to construct the second scale re-entrant structure, SiO2 nanoparticles were in situ generated via sol-gel method, during which process the particle size and density were determined by the concentration of TEOS and NH3*H2O solution. Appropriate particle size and density were selected as shown in Fig. 2(g, h, i), wherein the PSf nanofibers were coated with aggregated SiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 50-200 nm. Overcrowding distribution of SiO2 nanoparticles should be avoided to prevent the micro-pores from being blocked. The porosity of the pristine PSf and SiO2@PSf membranes were 83.08% and 81.35%, respectively, indicating that the deposition of SiO2 nanoparticles didn't significantly change the membrane porosity. Finally, low surface energy modification was also necessary to decrease the binding force between SiO2@PSf membrane surface and liquid droplet. After FOTS dipping coating treatment and crosslinking reaction, the initial smooth SiO2 nanoparticles changed into rough as observed in the magnified SEM view in Fig. 2(i, l), indicating the existence of extra fluorinated coating. Beyond that, there was no obvious morphology change could be observed in Fig. 2(j, k, l).",178

Only C, O, and S were observed on the pristine PSf membrane surface, while the elements C, O, S and Si were observed on the modified SiO2@PSf membrane surface with decreased weight ratio of elements C and S and increased weight ratio of elements O and Si, which was attributed to the growth of SiO2 particles. The element analysis of F-SiO2@PSf membrane indicated the enrichment of element F, proving that fluorine-containing chains were immobilized on the surface of F-SiO2@PSf membrane.",122

702,"The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has labeled phenolic derivatives as a priority contaminant in water. The limited concentration of phenol in wastewater discharge was set strictly to avoid environmental damage. The toxicity level of phenol derivatives is usually in the range of 9-25 mg.L-1 for both humans and aquatic life [12]. Long-term exposure to phenol can lead to a serious health problem such as diarrhea, vertigo, salivation, tremors, coma, and respiratory failure for humans exposed to lethal doses. Therefore, industries that produce phenol-contaminated wastewater, such as petroleum refineries, must pay attention to the treatment of wastewater to meet quality standards of wastewater discharge.",104
703,"Another pollutant in petroleum refinery wastewater and petrochemicals that becomes a serious issue is ammonia. Ammonia in wastewater is usually generated from the degradation of nitrogen components. Excessive ammonia in wastewater is highly toxic and harmful to the environment and human health; moreover, ammonia is associated with the malodor problem of wastewater [13]. Generally, the ammonia-nitrogen content in refinery wastewater is in the range of 20-80 mg.L-1 [14]. Treatment using chemical and biological methods are unable to nitrify the ammonia content to the desired level. Ammonia in wastewater is generated from the degradation process of nitrogen-containing compounds. Ammonia is toxic to aquatic life and human health at very low concentrations. The common maximum permitted level of ammonia in discharged wastewater is 0.7 mg.L-1 [15]. Ammonia in water can be in an equilibrium state of dissolved ammonia and ammonium ions or bound as organic amine (R-NH2), as shown in Eq. 1.(1)NH3 + H2O - NH4+ + OH-",156
704,"Wastewater from food processing plants is nutritious enough to enrich the nitrification bacteria by converting ammonium ions to nitrate ions. However, in petroleum wastewater treatment, nitrifying bacteria are seldom observed because of poor nutritional content. Therefore, it is highly important to develop an effective method for phenolic compounds and ammonia removal or neutralization, given their serious environmental threat.",58
705,"In this study, a nanohybrid PSf membrane was used as a support membrane, and a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer was added to improve the membrane surface properties. PVA is a low-cost polymer that possesses good chemical and mechanical stability, excellent hydrophilicity, and film-forming ability, which is widely used as the coating material. PVA can be used to produce a stable membrane with good mechanical properties and selective permeability to water by crosslinking, grafting, or other modification reactions. The objectives of introducing PVA on the PSf membrane were to enhance the removal efficiency of phenol and ammonia in petroleum wastewater and to improve the membrane mechanical properties as well as to minimize the membrane fouling during operation. Furthermore, the removal efficiency and permeability were studied using untreated petroleum refinery wastewater effluent to explore the industrial applicability of this technique.",138
706,"Polysulfone (Udel(r) PSU P1700NT) polymer granules were purchased from Solvay, USA, and used as the main polymer of the membrane preparation. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent and sulfuric acid were supplied from Merck, USA. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 86 %-88 % hydrolyzed, Mw 130,000 Da), polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 Da as a pore-forming agent and glutaraldehyde (GA) as a crosslinking agent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Nanosized ZnO powder (+-350 nm) was obtained from Nano Center Indonesia, Indonesia. PRW (sedimentation-coagulation effluent) was obtained from Pertamina, Ltd., and the characteristics of the wastewater are presented in Table 1.",99
707,"Nanohybrid PSf-ZnO membranes were fabricated via a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method adapted from a previous study [28]. ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in NMP at various total solid concentrations, as shown in Table 2, and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min. PSf and PEG were dissolved in NMP at the polymer concentrations listed in Table 2 and stirred for 8 h. The ZnO suspensions and polymer solutions were blended and homogenized. The polymer solution was then cast using a manual casting machine with an outlet gap thickness of 150 mm. The polymer film was evaporated for 60 s to form a selective layer and was subsequently immersed in pure water for 24 h at room temperature for complete phase separation. The wet membranes were placed between filter papers and dried at 50 degC for 24 h.",138
708,"According to the previous work [29], the addition of ZnO in polymer matrix significantly improved the permeate flux and mechanical strength of the membrane but risks on creating unselective gap. Coating procedure using PVA polymer on the fabricated nanohybrid membrane one of which aims to help overcoming the aforementioned issue. The PVA coating was prepared by dip-coating the top surface of the membrane to provide a selectivity property [30]. PVA solutions were prepared with the concentrations in Table 2. An appropriate amount of PVA granules was dissolved in deionized water at 85 degC under constant stirring for 8 h. The top side of the membrane was dipped into the PVA solution, and the excess solution on the membrane surface was wiped off using filter paper. The coated membranes were crosslinked using a crosslink-agent containing 5 wt% glutaraldehyde and 0.5 wt% sulfuric acid as the catalyst. The coated membranes were rinsed to remove the residual chemicals. A schematic illustration of the membrane coating using PVA is shown in Fig. 2.",169
709,"The morphology of both the surface and internal structure of the fabricated membranes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL Series JSM-6510-LA, Japan). The morphological structure of the membrane was observed at low and high magnification (1000x and 20,000x). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Perkin Elmer Frontier, USA) was used for the investigation of the change in the chemical groups as a result of the modification treatment. The FT-IR spectra of the fabricated membranes were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000-400 cm-1.",83
710,"Water contact angle (WCA) measurements were performed via a sessile-drop method with 25 degC pure water used as the probe liquid. The static angle of the water droplet on the membrane surface was measured using an angle-meter (RASE Angle-meter, Japan) at six different points. The membrane mechanical strength was studied by measuring the tensile strength and elongation percentage at break using a testing machine (UTS H001, China). The membrane sample (5cm x 1cm) was clamped and stretched at a rate of 20 mm.min-1 until the break poin. The mechanical strength test was repeated three times for each membrane type.",99
711,"The membrane performance in terms of the pure water permeability (PWP), water flux using untreated PRW, and contaminant removal (total phenols, ammonia, TDS, COD, and turbidity) were performed using a cross-flow filtration setup as shown in Fig. 3. The tested membrane (with an effective area of 15.90 cm2) was compacted using pure water at 5 bar for 30 min before PWP measurement. The PWP was recorded every 0.5 h at a constant pressure of 5 bar. For untreated refinery wastewater filtration, the pure water was replaced with untreated wastewater. The PWP (Jw) and wastewater permeate flux (Ji) were calculated using Eq. 2[31].(2)J=VA.tWhere J is the permeate flux, L. m-2 h-1; V is the permeate volume, L; A is the effective membrane area, m2; and t is the permeation time (h).",130
712,"Pollutant rejections were calculated using Eq. 3 as follows [32]:(3)R=1-CpCfx100%Where Cp and Cf are the pollutant concentration in the permeate and feed solution, respectively. The ammonia and total phenol concentration were analyzed using spectrophotometric measurements. Other pollutant rejections such as TDS, COD, and turbidity were determined using a conductivity meter, spectrophotometer, and nephelometer, respectively.",54
713,"Finger-like micropore structures were observed the cross-sections of all membranes. The shape and micropore size of the finger-like structures were similar for all membranes because the membrane support materials have the same composition. The structural properties of the membrane sublayer were attributed to the polymer solution composition. The viscosity and hydrophilicity of the polymer solution play an important role in determining the micropore structural properties. The high concentration of the incorporated nanoparticles leads to larger finger-like micropores. Closer observation of the membrane top-layer revealed that the thickness of the dense layer of the membrane is different. The PVA-coated membrane has a thicker layer than the uncoated membrane. The average dense layer thickness of the uncoated and PVA-coated membranes based on SEM analysis are 1.62 +- 0.30 mm and 3.47 +- 0.41 mm, respectively. A thicker dense layer resulted from the PVA coating on the selective layer of the membrane. With focused observation at the selective layer, it can be noticed the different characteristic layer can be ascertained as PVA layer. The denser selective layer may improve the molecular separation; however, it also decreases the water flux [36].",187
714,"The functional groups of the fabricated membrane were inspected using FT-IR spectra analysis. The FT-IR spectra of the uncoated nanohybrid PSf-ZnO and PVA-coated membranes are shown in Fig. 5. The FT-IR spectra of the uncoated membrane (PSf-ZnO) show characteristic peaks at around 1582 cm-1 representing the aromatic ring of the PSf backbone. Methyl and sulfone groups were observed by the appearance of a single sharp peak at 1487 cm-1 and double peaks at around 1297 cm-1, respectively. The peak at 2969 cm-1 also indicates the stretching of C-H from the methyl in PSf. The presence of ZnO in the membrane was observed by the weak stretching of the absorbed hydroxyl at 450 cm-1. The weak broad peak from 3700-3000 cm-1 represented the vibration of-OH absorbed by ZnO nanoparticles, which indicates that the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles improved the hydrophilicity of the polysulfone membrane.",143
715,"The WCA of the membrane surface is influenced by several factors, including surface tension, hydrophilic property, and surface roughness. Membrane hydrophilicity is attributed to the water permeation rate through the membrane barrier in the filtration process. As shown in Fig. 6, the static WCA of the neat PSf membrane shows the highest value, i.e., 61.75deg. This result shows that polysulfone has a slight hydrophobic nature. With the addition of 0.5 wt% ZnO nanoparticles, the WCA decreases from 61.75deg to 46.00deg; the ZnO nanoparticles enhance the hydrophilic property of the PSf membrane surface. This result is supported by the FT-IR spectra analysis, where the addition of ZnO resulted in the presence of absorbed-OH, thus the membrane becomes more hydrophilic.",118
716,"The PVA layer on the membrane surface significantly decreases the WCA from 46.00deg to 31.17deg at a PVA concentration of 1 wt%. The improvement of the surface hydrophilicity might come from the presence of hydroxyl groups in the PVA. This explanation is supported by the FT-IR analysis, where the hydroxyl vibration band increases significantly. Moreover, the presence of PVA as a selective skin layer decreases the surface roughness of the membrane, as shown in Fig. 3. The previous study conducted by Woo and co-workers also revealed that a rougher membrane surface had a higher WCA value [38]. The higher concentration of the PVA slightly decreasing the contact angle might be due to the increase in PVA in the coating solution resulting in a denser skin top-layer. The denser skin layer slightly increased the surface tension; therefore, increasing the PVA concentration in the coating solution is not linearly proportional to the decrease in the WCA.",154
717,"The PVA deposition on the PSf-ZnO membrane improves both the tensile strength and elongation at break. This phenomenon is attributed to the PVA coating on the membrane surface. PVA naturally has excellent tensile strength, flexibility, and adhesive properties. The presence of PVA provides enhancement of the support membrane mechanical strength. The adhesive and flexibility properties of PVA contributed to the tensile strength and elongation at break of the whole membrane. The PVA coating significantly enhanced the membrane mechanical strength, extending the membrane life span.",84
718,"Untreated petroleum wastewater filtration experiments in a cross-flow system were performed to evaluate the separation performance of the prepared membranes. The wastewater was obtained from the physical-chemical waste treatment output of Pertamina, Ltd., Indonesia. The characteristics of the wastewater were 1800 mg.L-1 total dissolved solid, 671.68 mg.L-1 COD, 143 mg.L-1 NH3, 75 mg.L-1 total phenol, and 32 NTU turbidity. As shown in Fig. 8, the initial flux of PSf was slightly enhanced from 1.68 to 1.82 L.m-2. h-1 by the membrane with 0.5 wt% ZnO nanoparticles. However, the PVA coating caused a decline in the initial flux to 1.23 L.m-2 h-1, 0.84 L.m-2 h-1, and 0.69 L.m-2 h-1 for PVA concentrations of 1, 2, and 3 wt%, respectively. The enhancement of the permeate flux may be related to the improvements in the membrane porosity and hydrophilicity by the addition of nano-ZnO nanoparticles in the PSf membrane. The decline of the initial permeate flux might be due to the increase in skin layer thickness as a result of the PVA coating that also increased the resistance.",175
719,"Another parameter in the membrane performance evaluation was pollutant rejection. In this study, phenol and ammonia are the pollutants focused on removal from wastewater. Phenol and ammonia levels become an issue in PRW treatment using conventional techniques. As shown in Fig. 9, all fabricated membranes exhibited a phenol removal efficiency greater than 51 %, and the ammonia removal efficiency greater than 82 %. The removal efficiency obtained from this study was greater than a previous study [41] that reached 25 %- 50 % removal efficiency. This lower efficiency may be due to the effect of other contaminants in the untreated wastewater. Ammonia (NH3) in wastewater is in the equilibrium state with ammonium ions (NH4+), which can be absorbed by other contaminants, such as colloids and suspended solids, that are easier to remove using a membrane. Hence, the pH plays an essential role in the separation efficiency, where the pH of the feed determines the equilibrium state between NH3 and NH4+ ions. The presence of the PVA layer improves the selectivity performance of the membrane by enhancing the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51.52%-82.68% and 82.89%-92.42%, respectively. The enhanced removal efficiency may be due to charge exclusion.",197
720,"The main issue in membrane separation applications for wastewater treatment is fouling during operation. Fouling in the membrane gradually decreases the permeation flux and also reduces the lifespan of the membrane; therefore, the membrane application is not economically feasible. In this work, the PVA coating was used to enhance the membrane hydrophilicity to improve the antifouling behavior of the membrane. The examination of the fouling can be performed by qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitative analysis can be performed through a fouling autopsy to indicate the foulant deposition on the membrane [46]. In this study, a quantitative approach was conducted to evaluate how much the membrane modification can mitigate the fouling formation during PRW treatment. A series model of the resistance equation derived from Darcy's law was used to examine the resistance created by the foulant. The resistance in the membrane separation was contributed to by the membrane structure itself, absorbed foulant, and cake formation of the foulant deposition on the membrane surface. The resistance of the fabricated membranes during a 150-min PRW filtration experiment are shown in Table 4.",179
721,"The value of Rm decreases slightly with the addition of ZnO nanoparticles, possible because the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles improves the porosity and hydrophilicity. However, the Rm of the membrane increases as the PVA coating is applied. This increase in Rm might be because the PVA coating decreased the size of the surface pores on the membrane, forming a denser membrane. Alternatively, the PVA addition increases the selective layer thickness, thus increasing the resistance. The lowest resistance from the absorbed foulant was shown by the membrane with a 2 wt% PVA coating. The highest cake resistance was shown by a neat PSf membrane that has a slightly hydrophobic surface and unrepaired properties. As shown in Table 4, the PVA in the selective layer can reduce pollutant deposition on the membrane wall despite the significant increase in the intrinsic membrane resistance. The PVA coating improves the antifouling behavior of the membrane.",150
722,"Nanohybrid membranes of PSf-ZnO with crosslinked PVA were successfully fabricated with a dense and smooth surface using a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The PVA coating can significantly repair the porous surface of the nanohybrid membrane, as shown in SEM images. The FT-IR spectra analysis also revealed that the addition of ZnO nanoparticles and a PVA coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity by introducing-OH functional groups. These results were supported by WCA measurement. The membrane also exhibited a distinct improvement in the surface charge, mechanical strength, pollutant removal efficiency, and antifouling behavior. The modification made in this study significantly enhanced the phenol and ammonia removal efficiency from 51.52%-82.68% and 82.89%-92.42%, respectively. The fouling evaluation also showed that the PVA coating provides lower cake and absorbed foulant resistance during PRW treatment.",130

728,"Nowadays, water pollution caused by industrial manufacturing emission, such as plastic, textile, leather, etc., has been attracted huge attention due to its serious harm to environmental and human healthy. Moreover, a huge amount of dye wastewater is produced during the industrial production process, which ultimately impede the compromise photosynthesis of the hydrophyte and cause aesthetic impact. (Khan et al., 2020; Pereira et al., 2021). Several methods, such as photocatalysis, biodegradation, adsorption, membrane filtration, and precipitation (Ahmed et al., 2020, 2021; Ismail et al., 2021) have been used to remove various synthetic dyes from wastewater. Among which, adsorption has been widely used to remove organic pollutants in water, owing to its high efficiency, low cost and easy operation (Baig et al., 2021).",121
729,"Over the past two decades, researchers have explored organic and inorganic materials such as graphene oxide/polyaniline (Moonis Ali Khan et al., 2021), CuFe2O4/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MMT) (Wabaidur et al., 2020), CuFe2O4/drumstick pod (Khan et al., 2019), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide/MMT (Kenawy et al., 2018), polycaprolactone/Se nanoparticles (Al-Mogbel et al., 2021). These adsorbents were synthesized generally in the form of powders or lamellar, which displayed organic adsorption capacities and adsorption kinetics due to their large specific areas. However, the specifications of these adsorbents are unqualified to be packed for practical applications at preparative scale or as dispersants in mobile phase solutions, causing clogging problems and serious hydrodynamic limitations with a huge pressure drop. Thereby, the microsphere adsorbents have become a research hotspot owing to its mass transfer kinetics and mechanical stability (Gao et al., 2020). Moreover, porous organic microspheres have received extensive attention attributing to their diverse surface/internal structure and large specific surface area, which can provide abundant active sites, and fast mass diffusion and transport in pollutant solution (Guo et al., 2009; Guan et al., 2021).",175
730,"In this work, we prepared a novel porous hollow carboxyl-polysulfone (PH-CPSF) microspheres for organic dyes adsorption. PH-CPSF can be facilely synthesized via non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) and click reaction. Functional group of the carboxyl has been successfully grafted onto the sponge-like core-shell PH-PSF microspheres. The introduction of synergistic effect of the carboxyl group and physical structure of PH-CPSF enhances the adsorption effect and reusability of the PH-CPSF, thereby facilitating the large-scale water purification performance under high operation conditions. Furthermore, the presence of carboxyl group and the surface roughness of porous PH-CPSF endow the contact angles of PH-CPSF and water decrease. As a result, the microspheres were characterized and the adsorption performance for methylene blue (MB) were studied in detail to obtain optimal operation conditions. The equilibrium and adsorption kinetics of the adsorption process were also studied. Finally, the recycling and the selective adsorption experiments were conducted and a filter device based on the prepared PH-CPSF microspheres was built and test to demonstrate the potential application of the prepared PH-CPSF microspheres for cationic dyes removal.",174
731,"Polysulfone (PSF Mw ca. 80 k) was obtained from Shandong Horan Special Plastic (Weihai, China). Dichloromethane (DCM, 99.5%), chloroform (99.5%), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99.5%), ethyl alcohol (EtOH) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Shanghai, China). Chlorotrimethylsilane ((CH3)3SiCl), p-Toluene-sulfonyl azide (TsN3, 75% (EtOH) solution), copper (I) bromide (CuBr), propiolic acid, paraformaldehyde, tin (IV) chloride (SnCl4), trimethoxy-chlorosilane were applied by Aladdin Chemical (Shanghai, China). All reagents were used without further purification.",75
732,"The preparation of carboxyl polysulfone microspheres is shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSF) was synthesized by a mild reaction without chain scission (Scheme 1a). PSF (10.00 g, 22.5 mmol) was dissolved in 500 mL chloroform in a round bottom three-necked flask. Paraformaldehyde (13.40 g, 450 mmol), SnCl4 (0.54 mL, 4.5 mmol), and (CH3)3SiCl (57 mL, 450 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred under mechanical agitation for 12 h. At the end of this period, the solution was filtered with a sand core funnel to remove undissolved reactant, then precipitated in methanol and dried. The as-obtained product was named as chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSF).",106
733,"Secondly, as illustrated in Scheme 1b, CMPSF porous hollow microspheres were prepared via non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) methods. Typically, 1.00 g CMPSF and 0.80 g PEG1000 were dissolved in 50 mL NMP/DCM (1:5, vt %) mixed solvent and stirred for 30 min to obtain the precursor solution. Then, the precursor solution was slowly injected into the 500 mL coagulating bath (0.2% PVA aq). After the solvent dispersed in coagulation bath, a sustained stirring was applied at room temperature (25 degC) for 3 h. After washed with deionized water (DIW) and dried at 60 degC for 3 h, the obtained product was named as porous hollow chloromethylated polysulfone (PH-PSF) microspheres.",109
734,"Eventually, the PH-PSF microspheres were modified with TsN3 and propioic acid for further functionalization (Scheme 1c). The prepared PH-PSF microspheres were dispersed in 100 mL EtOH, and a suspension of PH-PSF was obtained with a concentration of 10 mg mL-1. Then, 0.50 g TsN3 was added into 100 mL PH-PSF/EtOH suspension and reacted for 6 h at 60 degC. Then, the product was washed three times with excess DIW and EtOH. After drying at 50 degC for 3 h, the porous hollow azide polysulfone (PH-NPSF) microspheres were obtained. Subsequently, 0.50 g PH-NPSF, 0.10 g propiolic acid and 0.01 g CuBr were add into 40 mL EtOH/DIW (10:4, vt %) and reacted at room temperature for 6 h under N2 atmosphere. Then, the obtained products were sequentially washed with DIW and EtOH for several times. After drying at 50 degC for 3 h, carboxyl polysulfone porous hollow microspheres were obtained and named as porous hollow carboxyl polysulfone (PH-CPSF) microspheres.",158
735,"In this work, methylene blue (MB) was selected to evaluate the adsorption capacity of PH-CPSF microspheres. First, the effect of pH was performed by mixing 10 mg PH-CPSF microspheres into 20 mL MB solution (10 mg L-1) with different initial pH of MB solutions (pH ranging from 2 to 10). After 120 min contact time, the concentration of MB left in supernatant solutions were determined to study the effect of pH.",71
736,"Then, the effect of deprotonation on the adsorption of PH-CPSF microspheres was studied with protonated/deprotonated PH-CPSF, untreated PH-CPSF and PH-PSF microspheres, 10 mg microspheres was added into 20 mL MB solution (10 mg L-1, pH = 7). Meanwhile, the kinetic mechanism of protonated/deprotonated PH-CPSF microspheres was studied. The concentration of MB left in supernatant solution after different time intervals (5-60 min) were determined to study the effect of deprotonation.",69
737,"Last, the effect of initial concentration was studied with different MB initial concentrations, 10 mg deprotonated PH-CPSF microspheres were added into 20 mL MB solution (10-320 mg L-1, pH = 7) while other conditions were the same as the experiments of pH effect.",43
738,"To carry out the recycling experiments, the PH-CPSF microspheres were firstly immersed into 1 M HCl for desorption and immersed into 1 M NaOH for deprotonation for 2 h, respectively, and then the PH-CPSF was washed with DIW for the subsequent experiments.",42
739,"The MB, rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange (MO), acid fuchsin (AF) was used to verify the selective adsorption effect of the PH-CPSF for the cationic dyes, and the microspheres were immersed into various mixed solutions (MB + RhB, MB + MO, MB + AF, MO + AF). The contents of all dyes in the mixed solution were 10 mg L-1. After 60 min contact time, the concentrations of dyes left in supernatant solutions were determined to study the selective effect.",80
740,"In the whole experiment, the concentrations were detected by UV-vis spectrophotometer. The instantaneous adsorption capacity (qt) of the microspheres were determined by the change of dyes concentration, and calculated by the following Eq. (1):(1)qt=(Cr0-Ctm)xVwhere Cr0 (mg L-1) and Ct (mg L-1) are the initial MB concentration and concentration at time t, V (L), and m (g) represent the volume of dye solution and the weight of adsorbent, respectively.",68

743,"To further investigate the thermal properties of the PH-CPSF microspheres, DSC and TGA measurements were carried out (Fig. 3). For the PSF, the significant weight loss is observed in the temperature range of 500-600 degC, which is ascribed to the decomposition of the PSF (Fig. 3a). After the click functionalization, the PH-CPSF initial decomposition temperature is 230 degC, which is assigned to the decomposition of C-N bond (Tarchoun et al., 2020). In addition, it can be found in DTG curves that the different kinds of polymer exhibit a common endothermic peak at 510 degC, corresponding to the decomposition of aromatic backbone of the PSF. Two endothermic peaks at 200-250 degC and 400-600 degC are observed in the PH-CPSF, assigned to the decomposition of C-N and CH2Cl. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the PH-CPSF (187.6 degC) is higher than that of the PSF (185.2 degC) from the DSC curves (Fig. 3b), which can be ascribed to the introduction of carboxyl. The large volume of 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole carboxyl side group in PH-CPSF not only increases the steric hindrance of segment motion, but also increases the interaction between the molecular chains (Liu et al., 2017).",192
744,"Subsequently, the zeta potentials of the PH-PSF, PH-CPSF microsphere were investigated by a Zetasizer Nano ZS. The zeta potentials of the PH-PSF and PH-CPSF are -22.7 mV and -41.9 mV (Table S2), respectively. The surface electronegativity of the microspheres after graft modification is enhanced, which can increase the adsorption capacity of cationic dyes. The hydrophilicity of the PH-PSF and PH-CPSF microsphere were measured by attaching the microspheres to a glass plate with double-sided adhesive (Fig. 3c). Compared with the PH-PSF (Fig. 3d), the contact angles of PH-CPSF decrease from 96.56deg to 60.12deg (Fig. 3e). The possible explain could be as follow: firstly, due to the -COOH on the surface of PH-CPSF with strong polarity and hydrophilicity, it is easy to combine with water molecules through hydrogen bonds, increasing the surface hydrophilicity of the microspheres; secondly, the surface roughness of the modified microspheres is increased, which is conducive to the diffusion and penetration of water molecules on the surface, thereby reducing the contact angles. The increased hydrophilicity of PH-CPSF microspheres facilitates the diffusion and effective adsorption of cationic dyes during the adsorption process.",182
745,"According to the different adsorption capacities of PH-CPSF microspheres after protonation and deprotonation, the regeneration of PH-CPSF microspheres can be achieved by treating microspheres in acidic/basic solution, benefiting from the acid and alkali resistance of PSF and the stability of carboxylate groups. The PH-CPSF microspheres can be quickly regenerated in 1 M HCL for desorption and 1 M NaOH for deprotonation, and the regeneration mechanism diagram is shown in Fig. 5a. The morphology and structural integrity of the PH-CPSF microspheres (Fig. 5b) are well maintained with desirable recyclability after being recycled for 20 times (Fig. 5c). After 20 adsorption cycles, PH-CPSF can still achieve a removal rate of 95.3% for MB (Fig. 5d).",113
746,"In summary, we successfully prepared PH-CPSF microspheres, which have proven to be an efficient and selective adsorbent for the removal of cationic dyes. The high adsorption capacity (154.5 mg g-1, 25 degC) of the PH-CPSF microspheres for cationic dyes (MB) is due to the structural properties of the adsorbent, electrostatic interactions and p-p stacking interactions, following a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model. In addition, the microspheres also show a desirable recyclability with a removal rate of 95.3% for MB after 20 times. Moreover, PH-CPSF microspheres can be used as advanced adsorbents to continuously and automatically remove cationic pollutants in wastewater with a removal rate 94.0% under a flow rate of 8000 L m-3 h-1 for MB, which provide the possibility for large-scale purification of dyes and industrial wastewater in the future.",132

752,"Polyamide (PA) reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes fabricated by interfacial polymerization have been widely used in desalination of water all over the world thanks to their high separation efficient, wide pH range and compaction resistance [1-4]. However, PA membrane is highly sensitive towards chlorine [5]. Chlorine is a common bactericide added into the feed solution to mitigate the biofouling of membranes in water treatment process [6]. The poor chlorine resistance of PA membranes can be ascribed to the electron effect of NHCO- group. The amidic nitrogen is willing to share its lone-pair electron with chlorine atom, which is electron deficiency. This results in a reversible NCl reaction on polyamide chain [7]. The further destruction of polyamide is an irreversible Orton rearrangement, producing chlorinated ring [8]. Based on the mechanism of PA chlorinated degradation, many strategies have been proposed for improving the chlorine resistance of PA membranes, such as using novel monomer [9,10], surface modification with sacrificial layer [11,12], and the modification of amide bond [13]. However, these methods only mitigate the rate of chlorinated degradation of PA membrane rather than eradicating the problem.",185
753,"Adopting non-polyamide based material with high chlorine resistance to prepare desalination membrane is an available method [14-16]. The chain structure of PSf and polyethersulfone (PES) materials possesses outstanding chlorine resistance compared with polyamide [17,18]. The performance of membranes fabricated by PSf and PES presents slight decline when undergoing chlorine-resistance test [18,19]. Therefore, they are candidates to fabricate chlorine-resistant desalination membrane. However, one drawback of PSf and PES to be used for desalination membrane is their hydrophobicity. Introduction of hydrophilic groups such as COOH [20], NH2[21], and SO3H [22] into polymer chain is an efficient method to enhance the hydrophilicity of PSf and PES. Thereinto, the synthesis of sulfonated polymer is the simplest and most practicable routing. In addition, the hydrophilicity of sulfonated polymer is outstanding. Hence, sulfonated polymer is usually utilized as membrane materials for desalination. Nowadays, nanofiltration (NF) membrane prepared by sulfonated polymer has been applied widely and sulfonated polyethersulfone NF membrane has been commercialized [23]. However, it is an aporia to achieve the NaCl rejection benchmark for RO operation using sulfonated polymer.",174
754,"Two types of techniques including the non-solvent induced phase inversion (NIPS) [23] and surface coating [18] can be used to fabricate RO membranes via sulfonated polymers. The membrane prepared by coating method is TFC membrane, whose separation layer is usually thinner than that of prepared by NIPS. Hence, coating is thought to be a prefer technology for developing RO membrane from sulfonated polymers. However, since the PSf support layer should not be soluble in the polymer solvents, the selection of suitable solvents is a challenge for coating method. Formic acid (FA) [27], an organic acid, is routinely used as the solvent for coating technology. Nevertheless, FA is toxic and corrosive. Thus, it is meaningful to try new solvent for preparing sulfonated polymers based RO membranes.",125
755,"In this study, sulfochlorinated polysulfone (SC-PSf) was synthesized and was used as the barrier layer material to fabricate TFC RO membrane via coating method. The sulfonyl chloride groups on SC-PSF were partially hydrolyzed to sulfonic groups for enhancing the hydrophilicity of SC-PSF. The residual sulfonyl chloride groups reacted with piperazine (PIP) for crosslinking the barrier layer to restrict membrane swelling in water. 2-Methoxyethanol (EM), a solvent of lower corrosivity compared with formic acid, was utilized as the solvent of coating solution [28]. In addition, tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), a surfactant, was added into the coating solution for improving the wettability of the coating solution to the supporting layer. Through optimizing coating conditions, a TFC RO membrane with suitable separation performance and excellent chlorine resistance was developed.",125
756,"Polysulfone (PSf, Udel(r) P-3500, Solvay Comp) was dried at 120 degC under vacuum for 12 h. Sulfuryl chloride, N-butyllithium (2.5 M solution in hexane), piperazine (PIP, Reagent Plus), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) were purchased from sigma-aldrich. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried by calcium hydride for 24 h, and then was distilled and stored into SCHLENK under nitrogen. N-hexane, 2-methoxyethanol (EM), dimethyl formamide (DMF), hydrochloric acid (HCl), glycerol and NaOCl were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.",76
757,"The preparation of SC-PSf referred to a previous literature as shown in (Fig. 1)[29]. Typically, PSf (6 g, 13.6 mmol) and 400 ml of THF were added into a four-necked round bottom flask, which was assembled by mechanical stirrer, argon inlet and thermometer. Subsequently, the PSf solution was cooled to -70 degC utilizing dry ice and acetone, and 2.1 equivalents (11.5 ml) of n-butyllithium was added into the flask at -70 degC. The solution was stirred for 1 h at -70 degC before 2.2 equivalents of sulfuryl chloride was added into the flask. Finally, 100 ml of deionized water was added into the solution for quenching active substances. The SC-PSf precipitate was obtained via pouring the polymer solution into i-propanol. The SC-PSf was washed by i-propanol for several times, and then was dried at 50 degC for 24 h under vacuum.",141
758,"Fig. 2 exhibits the hydrolysis of -SOCl2 SC-PSf (4 g) and 60 ml of THF were added into a flask, and the mixture was stirred by magnetic stirring until the solution was clear. Subsequently, 10 ml of deionized water was added into the solution at100 degC. The reaction hold for 2 h at100 degC. Thereafter, the solution was cooled to room temperature and was poured into i-propanol. The precipitate was collected and washed by i-propanol and deionized water for several times. Finally, the polymer was freeze-dried. The hydrolysis degree of SC-PSf could be adjusted by controlling the hydrolysed time. The obtained partially hydrolyzed polymer was labeled as SC(x)-S(y)-PSf, where x and y were the average numbers of sulfonyl chloride and sulphonic acid groups per repeating unit of prepared polymer, respectively.",130
759,"In order to calculate the amount of surplus SO2Cl groups, the THF solution of methylamine was utilized to react with SC-S-PSf (see Fig. 3). Concretely, 0.5 g of SC-S-PSf was dissolved into 10 ml of DMF, and then excessive methylamine was added into the solution. This reaction was stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Subsequently, the polymer solution was slowly poured into 2 mol/L of HCl aqueous solution. Through a acidification of 24 h, the polymer was acquired by filtration, and then dialyzed by dialysis bag (MD34, MWCO 500 D) until the conductivity of dialyzate was lower than 10 ms. Finally, the polymer was dried at 80 degC under vacuum for 12 h.",114
760,"Thin film composite (TFC) was prepared by coating method as shown in Fig. 4. The PSf supporting layer was treated by 25% (v/v) glycerol aqueous solution before using. Then, SC-S-PSf and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) with various weight concentrations were dissolved in EM to form clear solution. The solution was filtrated by a 0.22 mm PTFE syringe filter before using. In a typical coating process, the solution was poured onto PSf supporting layer and then evenly shook for 2mins to ensure the uniformity of prepared membrane. Subsequently, the coated membrane was placed into an oven and dried at 60 degC for 4 min. This non-crosslinked membrane was recorded as Muc. After that, a PIP solution in n-hexane (the content of PIP was set at 5% of SC-S-PSf weight in solution) was poured onto membrane surface and kept for 3mins to react with SO2Cl group for preparing crosslinked membrane. Next, the membrane was dried in an oven at 60 degC for 5mins. This membrane crosslinked once was recorded as Mc-1. Repeating above operations twice, a denser membrane which was recorded as Mc-2 could be obtained.",183
761,A Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer was used to tested the 1H NMR spectra of polymer.,16
762,The chemical constitution of polymer and membrane was characterized by attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) that uses a Bio-Rad Digilab Division FTS-80 spectrometer and an Irtran crystal at an incidence angle of 45deg. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Thermo ESCALAB 280 system using Mg/Ka as the radiation source was utilized to characterize the element composition of membrane surface.,59
763,"A homogeneous membrane was used to characterize the water uptake and swelling of SC-S-PSf. The preparation detail of homogeneous membrane was as following: a 5 wt% DMF solution of SC-S-PSf was cast onto a clean glass plate, and then DMF was slowly evaporated at 80 degC for 12 h. For producing crosslinked membrane, the dried membrane was immersed into PIP solution for 30mins. The prepared membranes were tailored to a 60 mm * 40 mm rectangle and then was placed into deionized water for 36 h at 25 degC. Then, fetch the membranes, wipe the water droplets on membranes, weight the membranes, and measure the length of the membranes. The wet membranes were dried under vacuum at 90 degC for 12 h and the weight and length of dried membranes were measured. Water uptake and swelling were calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively.(1)WateruptakeWU,%=Wwet-WdryWdry*100(2)SwellingS,%=Lwet-LdryLdry*100",144
764,"A scanning electron microscope (SEM, XL 30 ESEMFEG, FEI Company) was used to characterize the morphology and thickness of membranes. The cross-section sample was prepared through peeling off the sample from non-woven fabric under the condition of liquid nitrogen freezing. All samples were sprayed with gold before SEM characterized.",49
765,"The salt rejection and water flux of membrane were tested by a cross-flow configuration. The operation pressure was 1.55 MPa, and the feed solution was 2000 ppm NaCl solution. The valid membrane area of each cell was 15.79 cm2. The membranes sustained a pure water pressure of 1.55 MPa for 4 h before testing. The water flux was calculated by Eq. (3), and the salt rejection was calculated by Eq. (4).(3)J=VAtwhere v(L) is the volume of permeated solution, A(m2) is the tested membrane area, and t(h) is the time.(4)R=Cf-CpCfwhere Cp (mg/L) is the concentration of permeated solution, and Cf (mg/L) is the concentration of feed solution. These two concentrations were represented by the conductance of solution, which was measured by a conductance meter (DDS-11A, China). Each membrane chose six parallel samples, and the final result was the average value.",139
766,"A 2000 ppm of chlorine aqueous solution was prepared using NaOCl and deionized water. The pH of solution was adjusted to 6.0 using potassium acid phthalate. The experiment of chlorine tolerance was implemented by static soaking method at 25 degC. Specifically, the membrane coupons were inserted into a beaker which contained active chlorine aqueous solution and was packaged by aluminum foil to avoid the decrease of active chlorine. When reaching stated ageing time, the coupon was fetched and washed by deionized water for 30 mins before testing the seperation performance. The total exposure of sample to active chlorine was presented by ppm h. Besides, the chlorine tolerance of a PA TFC membrane which was synthesized according to our previous work [30] was also tested as comparation.",126
767,"2-Methoxyethanol (EM), which was low corrosivity, was selected to be the solvent. Because there was a hydroxyl group on EM, the OH may react with - SO2Cl. Therefore, the stability of SC(0.6)-S(1.04)-PSf in EM was tested. The specific operation was depicted as follows. Firstly, 1 wt% solution of SC(0.6)-S(1.04)-PSf in EM was heated at 60 degC for 1 h. Secondly, the solution was cast onto a glass plate, and dried at 60 degC for 20 min. Finally, the produced film was washed with ethyl alcohol for several times and dired at atmosphere for 24 h. Fig. 5 exhibits the 1H NMR of SC(0.6)-S(1.04)-PSf undergoing stability test. According to the reference, EM possesses three kinds of protons characteristic peaks, which are CH3 (3.30 ppm, s), CH2 (3.39 ppm, t) and CH2 (3.55 ppm, t) [32], respectively. After stability test, the protons characteristic peaks of EM do not appear in range of 3.0-4.0 ppm as shown in Fig. 5. The result demonstrates - SO2Cl groups can not react with EM solution at testing time and SC(0.6)-S(1.04)-PSf is stable in EM.",178
768,"The membrane was fabricated via coating polymer solution on PSf porous supporting layer. The supporting layer was treated referencing E. McGrath means [24], where glycerol was used to keep an open pore structure on supporting layer. EM was the solvent of polymer solution and the curing temperature was selected at 60 degC. Other preparation conditions of TFC membrane such as additive, solution concentration, and crosslinking conditions were discussed in the next sections.",72
769,"Subsequently, the influence of TBAC concentration was disscussed. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the NaCl rejection enhanced from 50% to 80% with TBAC concentration increased from 0.2 wt% to 0.5 wt%. However, the seperation performance of membranes obviously changed slowly when the concentration of TBAC exceeded 0.35 wt%. This might be due to the mild change of the surface tension of coating solution when the concentration of TBAC exceeded 0.35 wt%. Therefore, 0.35 wt% was selected as the adding concentration of TBAC.",82
770,"PIP was selected as the crosslinker. The number of SO2Cl groups per repeating unit was 0.6. Hence, the PIP concentration was chose as 5% of SC(0.6)-S(1.04)-PSf weight concentration. At this concentration ratio, the mole ratio of -NH- on PIP to SO2Cl groups on polymer was 1.2, which guaranteed the sufficient crosslinking between SO2Cl and NH- groups as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 8(a) shows the separation performance of non-crosslinked Muc and crosslinked Mc-1. The NaCl rejection of membranes improved from 80% to 90% after crosslinking, which manifested crosslinking made a denser chain structure. The effect of coating solution concentration on the seperation performance of Mc-1 was depicted in Fig. 8(b). For Mc-1, NaCl rejection varied from 87% to 95%, while the water flux declined from 19.3 L/m2h to 15 L/m2h as the coating solution concentration increased from 0.3 wt% to 0.75 wt%. Higher concentration solution coated onto PSf supporting layer would form thicker seperation layer. Hence, the rejection improved and water flux decreased. As shown in Fig. 8(b), even if high polymer concentration (0.75 wt%) was used, a single coating step could not satisfy the rejection benchmark of RO membrane.",190
771,"Table 2 summarizes the water flux and NaCl rejection of Mc-2 0.3/0.3 and other referenced membranes. Compared with SPAES-X-1.0 and BPS-32 which were also prepared by coating method, Mc-2 0.3/0.3 had a water flux 185% and 213% higher than SPAES-X-1.0 and BPS-32, while its NaCl rejection preceded that of SPAES-X-1.0 and BPS-32. The result may be because the thickness of Mc-2 0.3/0.3 was lower than that of SPAES-X-1.0 and BPS-32 (250 nm vs 700 nm vs 679 nm) [24,27] and a crosslinking procedure was implemented. Nevertheless, the gap of the seperation performance between Mc-2 0.3/0.3 and commercial PA membrane is obvious as shown in Table 2.",106
772,"The chemical constitutions of PSf, Muc and Mc-2 were characterized by ATR-IR and XPS. As shown in Fig. 11, for Muc, new peaks at 1388 cm-1 and 3470 cm-1 appeared compared with the spectrum of PSf, and they corresponded to the characteristic bands of SO2Cl [33]and hydroxy of SO3H, respectively. In addition, the Cl element was detected on Muc surface and the content of S element on Muc surface increased compared to PSf as summerized in Table 3. These results directly suggested that SO2Cl and SO3H groups were introduced onto PSf. After crosslinking, the characterization band of SO2N- at 925 cm-1[34] appeared, and N element was detected on Mc-2, which manifested the occurence of crosslinking reaction. There still was a little amount of Cl element existing on Mc-2 surface, that might be because SO2Cl groups uncompletely reacted with PIP in short time.",142
773,"5 wt% DMF solution of SC(0.6)-S(1.04)-PSf and casting method were used to prepared homogeneous membrane (HM) for testing water uptake and swelling ratios of non-crosslinked and crosslinked membrane(HMuc, HMc). As shown in Fig. 12, the swelling ratios of membranes decreased from 9.7% to 5.2% after crosslinking. Crosslinking could astrict the movement of polymer chain to suppress the swelling of membrane in water [35]. Therefore, the salt rejection of membrane improved after crosslinking. Meanwhile, dense chain structure decreased water uptake of polymer. Hence, the water flux of crosslinked membrane decreased.",89
774,"Here, the chlorine-resistant sulfochlorinated and sulfonated polysulfone (SC-S-PSf) was successfully synthesized and used to prepare TFC RO membrane by coating on PSf supporting layer. Piperazine as the crosslinker reacted with sulfonyl chloride groups for crosslinking the coating layer.",38
775,"In the preparation process, tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), a common surfactant, was added into polymer solution to refrain from forming defects on separation layer. The NaCl rejection of the membrane fabricated by adding TBAC increased by 3.5 times in comparison to that of the bare membrane (80% vs 23%). Through adjusting coating conditions, 2-methoxyethanol as the solvent, 0.3 wt% of SC-S-PSf, 0.35 wt% of TBAC, two coating steps, and two crosslinking steps by PIP were chose for fabricating membrane Mc-2 0.3/0.3. The NaCl rejection and water flux of Mc-2 0.3/0.3 were 96.9% and 17.8 L/m2h (2000 ppm NaCl feed at 1.55 MPa operation pressure). Compared with other membranes prepared by coating method, Mc-2 0.3/0.3 had a water flux  ~200% higher than them [24,27]. When immersed Mc-2 0.3/0.3 and PA membranes into 2000 ppm and pH = 6 NaOCl aqueous solution for 10 days, the salt rejection of Mc-2 0.3/0.3 only decreased by 1%, while that of PA membrane decreased by 8%.",160
776,"Overall, a RO membrane with chlorine resistance was successfully produced based on the functional polysulfone which was not sensitive to chlorine. The present study may open a new avenue for the development of novel desalination membranes with chlorine resistance.",39

Several methods of wastewater treatment have been developed for organic pollution removal. Among which, adsorption has been regarded as the most widely used technique owing to its high effectiveness and ease of operation [1]. Porous polymer microspheres with super-hydrophobicity and super-oleophilicity are extensively used as adsorbent applied for the organic pollutants removal benefiting from its high specific surface area, surface reactivity, recoverability and relatively low cost [2,3].",89

Then, the precursor solution was slowly injected into a 120 mL coagulating bath (0.2% PVA aq.). After the solvent dispersed in coagulation bath, a sustained stirring was applied for 6 h at room temperature (25 degC). The as-obtained products were sequentially washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times.

The model for desorption hysteresis behavior of PHPSF matches the type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms model, which indicates that presence of mesopores in the microspheres structure [34]. Moreover, with the increaseing of PEG Mw, the N2 desorption curve shows obvious hysteresis, indicating that the number of passing pores of the microspheres increases. The most reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that the addition of PEG causes a morphological change, which converts the previously dead-end or closed pores into passing pores or inter-connected pores. In other words, the connectivity of the previously existing micropores has been improved. The specific surface area of PHPSF-3 is 5 times that of PSF microspheres (Table 2), which provides more adsorption sites for later adsorption.",172
796,"In this work, MB was selected to evaluate the influence of the change of specific surface area and porosity of PSF and PHPSF microspheres on the adsorption capacity. Benefiting from the electrostatic attraction between the MB+ and the negatively charged PSF materials [39], MB can be adsorbed on the surface of PHPSF microspheres (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the FTIR of PHPSF after adsorbed MB is shown in Fig. 6(b). A slight shift around 3400 cm-1 ascribing to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups exhibits a red shift, from 3370 to 3343 cm-1, which reveals the increase of hydrogen bond between PSF and MB.",102
797,"The intraparticle diffusion process diagram of MB adsorption onto PHPSF microspheres exhibits multiple linear characteristics (Fig. 6f), which indicates that two steps, the surface diffusion of the microspheres and the intraparticle diffusion, occur in this adsorption process. In addition, the slope of the first stage (ki1) is obviously greater than the slope of the second stage (ki2), indicating that the intra-particle diffusion stage is a gradual process. The regression line of PHPSF microspheres does not pass through the origin, attributing to the existence of pores on the surface of PHPSF microspheres, which could cause the initial boundary layer diffusion effects and the unique mass transfer in the later pores [42]. The PHPSF-3 microspheres could be washed and regenerated with ethanol, and retain adsorption capacity after 5 cycles (Fig. 6g). In addition, the structure of PHPSF-3 microspheres can retain after being soaked in 1 M HCl solution and 1 M NaOH solution for 1 h (Fig. 6h), respectively. Therefore, according to the above characteristics, the 3-dimensional porous structure with extraordinary physical and chemical stability of the PHPSF microspheres are favorable as a porous substrate and using in the static and dynamic treatment of dyes.",193
798,"In summary, a novel kind of porous hollow polysulfone (PHPSF) microspheres was prepared by non-solvent induced phase inversion method using PEG as a porogen. The PEG-rich phase is formed by combining with water, and leaches into the external aqueous phase during the phase separation process to form porous hollow microspheres. The resulting PHPSF microspheres exhibit sponge-like porous spherical shell and core-shell structure. The porosity, diameter and shell thickness of PHPSF microspheres can be adjusted by the Mw of PEG. The degree of PEG phase separation affects the pore structure of PEG during the phase inversion process. When the Mw of PEG is below 4000, the low |Dd| between PEG and solvent is conducive to the formation of microporous structure and narrower pore distribution. Whereas, high Mw of PEG tend to agglomerate forming a macroporous structure after phase inversion. Moreover, a well-fitted structure-performance correlation of microspheres is found, and a porous surface is obtained by a controlled phase-inversion. Owing to its readily preparation, controllable structure, high mechanical and chemical stability as well as reusability, this new kind of PHPSF microspheres is expected to have potential in practical water organic pollutants treatment and vectors for drug delivery.",195

803,"Recently, we employed spray coating enabled film formation for preparation of BCP composite membranes and fabricated polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) membranes by coupling spray coating with selective swelling [25]. The spray coating technique is frequently used to construct thin films on different substrates and possesses various advantages including low-cost production, high utilization of polymers and no limitation for substrate sizes or shapes [26-29]. It also shows great potential for mass volume manufacturing. Here in this study, we attempt to fabricate PSF/PEG block polymer (abbreviated as SFEG) membranes on macroporous supports by spray coating and selective swelling. Distinguished from PS-b-P2VP, SFEG has a higher mechanical strength and hydrophilicity, and their spray coating conditions are different. The thicknesses, structures and properties of the active layers under different coating/swelling conditions, which play a vital role in membrane separation [30,31], are studied. By taking the advantages of SFEG polymers, spray coating as well as selective swelling, a systematic fabrication process for UF membranes with tunable and superior performances is expected. Larger-area fabrication of SFEG membranes is discussed.",171
804,"The PSF-based triblock polymer, polyethylene glycol-block-polysulfone-block-polyethylene glycol (PEG-b-PSF-b-PEG, abbreviated as SFEG) was synthesized via aromatic nucleophilic substitution according to the reported protocol [32] and monomethylpoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG, Mn: 6 kg*mol-1) was used to synthesize SFEG. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of SFEG was 23,000 with PDI = 1.52, and the weight ratio of PEG in the SFEG was 22 wt%. Analytically pure grade 1,2-dichloroethane (>=99.0%), acetone (>=99.5%) and ethanol (>=99.7%) were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Regent Co., Ltd. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, purity of 98%) with a molecular weight of 66,000 and phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) tablets were purchased from MP Biomedicals, LLC. PBS solutions with a pH of 7.4 were obtained by dissolving one phosphate tablet in 100 ml deionized water. Dilute aqueous solutions of monodispersed 15-nm gold colloid were purchased from British Biocell International Limited. Nylon microfiltration membranes with a nominal pore size of ~0.8 mm were purchased from Haining Shenghua Filtration Equipment Co., Ltd. and used as the supports to prepare composite membranes. Deionized water (conductivity: 8-20 ms*cm-1) was used in all experiments. All regents were used without further purification.",184
805,"A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800) was used to detect both the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the composite membranes at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) was performed at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and electric current of 10 mA. The membranes were quick-frozen by soaking in liquid nitrogen and ruptured to obtain the samples for cross-sectional observation. All samples were sputter-coated with gold for 20 s to avoid charging effects prior to SEM characterizations. The thicknesses of SFEG layers were determined by data statistics according to the cross-sectional SEM images. As the expansion of SFEG polymer chains was confined in the vertical direction while the horizonal movements were limited by substrates. Porosities of the SFEG layers can be roughly calculated by the Eq. (1):(1)P=100%xt-t0/twhere t0 and t were the thicknesses of SFEG layers before and after swelling.",147
806,"Data statistics of at least 100 pores by the surface SEM image of each sample were conducted to estimate the average pore size. An angle goniometer (DropMeter A-100, Maist) was employed to analyze the surface hydrophilicity of composite membranes. For each sample, at least 5 positions were measured and the average value of the dynamic water contact angle (DWCA) was reported.",61
807,"Membrane performances were evaluated by a cross-flow apparatus (SF-SA, Hangzhou Saifei Membrane Separation Technique Co., Ltd.). Prior to filtration tests, pre-compaction of the composite membranes was carried out at the pressure of 0.15 MPa to ensure a stable flux. Water flux tests were performed at the pressure of 0.1 MPa and the effective area of the membrane is 7.1 cm2. BSA solutions with a concentration of 0.5 g*L-1 and dilute aqueous solutions of monodispersed gold colloid nanoparticles were used to illuminate the exclusion ability of SFEG membranes. The BSA and gold colloid nanoparticles concentrations in feed solutions, filtrates and retentates were detected by a UV-vis absorption spectrometer (NanoDrop2000c, Thermo). The rejection rates of BSA or gold colloid were calculated according to the Eq. (2):(2)R=100%x1-Cp/Cfwhere Cp and Cf are the concentrations of BSA/gold colloid nanoparticles in the filtrates and the feed aqueous solutions, respectively.",143
808,"The spray coating procedure was almost the same as our previous work [25]. After a series of preliminary investigations, the optimized conditions were determined as follows: SFEG solutions in 1,2-dichloroethane with a concentration of 3 wt% were extruded from the spray needle and deposited onto nylon supports. After coating and solvent evaporation, the initially macroporous nylon support (Fig. 2(a) and (c)) was fully covered by a thin, dense and defect-free layer (Fig. 2(b) and (d)) derived from the SFEG solutions. A small amount of SEFG solutions penetrated into the nylon support (Fig. 2(d)). By controlling the amounts of deposited SFEG solutions, the thickness of the final SFEG films can be decreased as thin as 1.2 mm on the premise of maintaining the integrity of SFEG layers at the optimal spray conditions. As the polymer dosages and membrane fluxed are both highly related to the film thickness, thinner BCP layers could lower the cost and improve fluxes. After completely dried in an oven at 100 degC for 30 min, the SFEG layers tightly attached on the nylon supports were intact and semitransparent (Fig. 2(e)), indicating the good strength and nonporous nature.",190
809,"The adhesive force between the separation layers and supporting layers has been a vital concern to construct composite structures [34,35]. We note that the adhesion between SFEG layers and nylon supports was tight enough to withstand strong shake in water. In this study, the adhesion between SFEG layers and nylon supports was roughly evaluated by treatment in ultrasonication in water at 100 W for 30 min. The SFEG-coated films remained their integrity and no detachment from supports was found. The composite membranes remained nonpermeable by tests in cross-flow apparatus at 0.1 MPa for 30 min after ultrasonication treatment, indicating that defect-free SFEG layers were tightly attached on nylon supports. The strong adhesion was considered to stem from the slight penetration of SFEG into nylon pores and the tight physical attachment of these SFEG with the nylon skeleton (Fig. 2(d)).",139
810,"Fig. 4(a) gives the thickness of SFEG layers after swelling in different paired solvents. With the increase of acetone, the thickness of the SFEG layers was increased to 1.24, 1.26, 1.27, 1.37, 2.63, 2.74, and 2.91 mm, respectively. The porosity of SFEG layers was increased from 4.0 to 5.6, 6.3, 13.1, 54.8, 56.6, and 59.1% respectively with the acetone mass content increasing from 5% to 7%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Here the membrane thicknesses were related to the porosities, and these results agreed with our discussions above.",94
811,"The adhesion between the SFEG layers and nylon supports after swelling was also evaluated. The volume expanding of SFEG domains after swelling in dual-solvents, might weaken the adhesive force between the two layers of composite membranes. Herein, ultrasonication treatments were performed to assess the adhesion of the two layers. As shown in Fig. S3, no cracks or detachments of the SFEG layers from supports were observed from a macroscopic view. Besides, the ultrasonicated-composite membranes possessed almost identical water fluxes and BSA rejection rates compared with the non-ultrasonication membranes, indicating that the SFEG layers were firmly attached to nylon supports after swelling.",101
812,"To explore the upscale ability of spray coating, larger microfiltration nylon substrates with a size of 30 cm x 30 cm were employed to fabricate SFEG composite films (Fig. 6(a)). Similar to Fig. 2(b) and (d), the macroporous structure of the nylon substrate was also completely covered by a thin, continuous and defect-free SFEG layer after spray coating (Fig. 6(b) and (c)). The thickness of SFEG layer was almost same with small-area fabrication about 1.15 mm. As shown in Fig. 7, the two composite membranes with smaller and larger size showed almost identical performances. This result demonstrated that larger SFEG membranes can be prepared at no expense of performances by spray coating and selective swelling. Moreover, as spray coating can be an uninterrupted process by moving the relative position of substrates, continuous preparation for composite membranes is possible by introducing a roll to roll process.",145
813,"Here we propose a facile and up-scalable fabrication strategy for PSF/PEG triblock polymer membranes by spray coating enabled film formation and selective swelling induced pore generation. The composite membranes consist of macroporous supporting layers and thin SFEG separation layers, which can be as thin as 1.2 mm obtained at optimal spray conditions. The adhesion between the two layers is demonstrated to be tight. Because the PSF and PEG components are chemically bonded in this triblock polymer with PSF as the majority block, SFEG membranes show good mechanical strength, stability, and hydrophilicity. The pore sizes, porosities, hydrophilicity and UF performances of the membranes are tunable by altering the composition of paired swelling solvents and the swelling durations. Moreover, larger-area SFEG membranes can be easily prepared at no expense of separation performances, implying the upscalability of this ""spraying coating + selective swelling"" process.",141

817,"As one of the main materials for ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, polysulfone (PSf) has attracted great attention due to its superior solubility, excellent mechanical strength, and good thermal stability. Despite the many advantages of PSf membranes, its widespread implementation is limited by membrane fouling. Biofouling is particularly problematic, as it affects the performance and lifetime of the membranes. Several strategies to modify the membrane surface in order to inhibit biofouling have been reported. One of them involves increasing the hydrophilicity of PSf membranes which can reduce the adhesion of biomacromolecules to membrane surfaces [1-4]. An alternative approach is to fabricate an antimicrobial surface which can inhibit the proliferation of microbes [5,6]. However, each method has its own significant drawbacks either as a result of the incapability to inhibit microbe proliferation or because of not being able to reduce the accumulation of dead microbes. It is therefore of great importance to develop functionalized membranes which not only reduce the adhesion of microbes but also inhibit microbial reproduction.",165
818,"Several antibacterial agents, such as N-chloramine compounds [7-10], quaternary ammonium compounds [11-14], silver nanoparticles [15-18], and chitosan [19,20] have been widely used. Among them, N-chloramine compounds have shown broad spectrum antimicrobial activity [10]. Furthermore, this activity is renewable by the reaction between amide and diluted sodium hypochlorite.",47
819,"Sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO, active chlorine >=5%) and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, >=99.0%) were obtained from Aladdin. E. coli MG1655 (ATCC 47076) and S. aureus (ATCC 6538) were purchased from the Coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSC) and Dingguo Biotechnology Co., Ltd, respectively. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, Mw 67 kDa, >=98%) was acquired from Sino-American Biotechnology Co., Ltd. PSf (Udel P-3500) was obtained by Solvay, USA. PES-g-PEO-80 was prepared as reported elsewhere [42].",70
820,"PSf was blended with PES-g-PEO-80 with different ratios in NMP as listed in Table 1. The dissolved solution was filtered through a G1 sand-core funnel. After degassing at 30 degC for 10 h, the solution was cast onto the nonwoven polyester fabric. The film was then immediately dipped into deionized water at which point phase inversion took place. The newly formed membranes were then stored in water. The N-chloramine membranes (M1-Cl, M2-Cl, M3-Cl) were obtained through soaking the blending membranes in 0.5% NaClO solution as reported [44,45].",87
821,"The membrane structures were observed on SEM (XL 30 ESEM FEG, FEI Company). The chemical compositions of the membranes were measured by X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCAL 250 spectrometer). The static contact angle was examined on a JC2000C Contact angle Meter (Powerach Co., Shanghai, China).",47
822,"Protein adsorption on asymmetric membranes was measured through fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer-labeled BSA (FITC-labeled BSA) as previously reported [42]. Generally, membranes were immersed in FITC-labeled BSA solution (1 mg/ml) and maintained for 12 h to allow for the protein adsorption. After removing the membranes from the BSA solution and washing gently with deionized water for three times to remove the loosely bound protein, the fluorescence on the membranes could be observed.",70
823,"The properties of the functionalized PSf membranes were evaluated according to a precedent study [42]. First, three membranes were treated with deionized water for 0.5 h, and the beginning flux of water J1 (L/(m2 h)) was obtained. Then, the membranes were subjected to 1.0 mg/mL BSA solution for 1 h. The water flux (Jp) and the BSA rejection (R) were calculated. After washing with deionized water, the membranes were refreshed and the water flux (J2) was calculated. The flux recovery ratio (FRR, Eq. (1)), flux decline ratio (Rt, Eq. (2)), reversible flux decline ratio (Rr, Eq. (3)), and irreversible flux decline ratio (Rir, Eq. (4)) were calculated to determine the antifouling ability of the functionalized membranes.(1)FRR=J2J1x100%(2)Rt=1-JPJ1x100%(3)Rr=J2-JpJ1x100%(4)Rir=1-J2J1x100%",116

The incubation was carried out at 37 degC for 6 h. The suspension of the bacteria was removed and the membrane samples were washed with PBS with gentle shaking. This process was repeated three times to remove any loosely bound bacteria. All membranes were treated with glutaraldehyde (3 vol%) and aqueous solutions of ethanol according to a previous study [23]. Finally, the bacterial adhesion on the membrane surfaces was observed by SEM.",103
825,"Biofouling is mainly caused by the proliferation of bacteria, so inhibition this growth is an effective method to reduce membrane fouling. The antibacterial activities of the functionalized membranes were investigated by E. coli and S. aureus. Antibacterial activities were evaluated by a ""sandwich"" system as previously reported [44]. Bacterial colonies on Luria Broth (LB) nutrient agar plates were counted.",59
826,"Biofilm on membrane surfaces is considered the main fouling of the membranes. The formation of a biofilm on the membrane surfaces was evaluated by S. aureus according to a precedent study [44,45]. Generally, each membrane was covered by 2 ml bacterial suspension for 2 h to ensure adequate contact. Subsequently, the bacterial suspensions were moved out and the membranes were washed gently with sterile water three times to remove the loosely attached bacteria. Then, the S. aureus attached on the membrane surfaces were cultured at 37 degC for 24 h in LB medium. After the bacterial reproduction process, the membranes were moved out, washed and treated with glutaraldehyde [23]. Finally, the formation of biofilm was observed.",116
827,"The functionalized PSf membranes were fabricated through two steps. First, the blended PSf membranes with different PES-g-PEO-80 mass ratios were obtained through the traditional nonsolvent induced phase separation process (NIPS). Then the blended membranes were treated with NaClO solution to obtain the N-chloramine functionalized membrane. As shown in Fig. 1, the top layer was dense and the sublayer had finger-like macrovoids. The formation of macrovoids was promoted by increasing the weight fraction of PES-g-PEO-80 in casting solutions, which was attributed to the increase in hydrophilicity and the excellent interactions between PSf and PES-g-PEO-80. Overall, this morphology resembled that of typical UF membranes. According to SEM observations, the membrane structures did not change before and after the treatment with NaClO.",119
828,"The antifouling property of the membranes is influenced by the membrane hydrophilicity. To evaluate the membrane hydrophilicity, the water contact angles were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The water angle decreased in conjunction with the increase in PES-g-PEO-80 content in the casting solution. When the PES-g-PEO-80 content was 2.7 wt%, the water contact angle was 60deg showing excellent hydrophilicity. The remarkable hydrophilicity of the modified membranes was believed to be due to the hydrophilic PEO segment on the membrane surfaces. Thus, the addition of PES-g-PEO-80 could effectively increase the hydrophilic property of the PSf membrane surfaces. Before and after the chlorination process, the contact angle of the membranes was unchanged.",114
829,"The performances of the membranes were evaluated through water flux and BSA rejection. The results are plotted in Fig. 6. According to the figure, the incorporation of PES-g-PEO-80 and N-chloramine functional groups had little impact on the rejection of BSA, indicating that the modification did not disturb the membrane separation performance. The water flux of the membrane increased after the addition of PES-g-PEO-80. When the PES-g-PEO-80 weight ratio was 2.7%, the water flux was 239 L/m2 h, which is contributed to a combination of outer surface hydrophilicity and macrovoids in the membrane matrix.",93
830,"Previous studies have suggested that the attachment of nonspecific and irreversible proteina on the membrane surfaces can cause biofouling. The inherent hydrophobicity of the PSf membrane makes it an easy target for protein adsorption. Thus, increasing the hydrophilicity is an excellent method to reduce membrane biofouling. The antifouling properties of the membranes were investigated by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BSA (FITC-BSA). The results are shown in Fig. 7. Membrane M0 demonstrated very high protein attachment, whereas, the functionalized PSf membranes showed decreased protein adsorptions. Furthermore, almost no BSA adsorptions were observed on M3-Cl, which was attributed to the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface.",101
831,"It is believed that the bacterial attachment to the membrane surface is the initial step for biofilm formation. To investigate the ability of hydrophilic modified membranes (M1-M3) to resist bacterial fouling, two bacterial species, E. coli and S. aureus were used to evaluate the attachment performance on the membrane surfaces. A virgin PSf membrane M0 was used as a control sample. The results of the bacteria surface adhesion tests on the blended PSf membranes are shown in Fig. 9. The virgin PSf membrane showed a high bacterial attachment after contact with bacteria for 6 h. This result can be assigned to the hydrophobicity of the membrane which enhanced the interaction between the bacteria and membrane surface. Significant quantitative decreases in the attachment of both S. aureus and E. coli were found for the blended membrane surfaces which could be attributed to the improved hydrophilicity of the membranes.",147
832,"To investigate the long-term antifouling properties of PSf membranes modified by incorporation of PES-g-PEO-80 and functionalization with the antibacterial N-chloramine group, biofilm formation on the membrane surface was examined. S. aureus was used as a model. PSf (M0) and the non-chlorinated membrane (M3) were selected as controls. After immersion in the suspension of S. aureus, the membranes were removed and washed gently three times to move the loosely attached bacteria. Then, the bacteria attached on the membrane surfaces were proliferated in LB. It was clearly visible that there occurred significant bacterial growth on both the PSf membrane and M3, since the OD600 reached 1.2 and 0.6, respectively, whereas bacterial growth was hardly present on the functionalized membranes. The formation of biofilm on the membranes was also evaluated (Fig. 11). However, a reduced amount of bacteria was found on M3, indicating that the hydrophilicity can enhance the antifouling property but could not inhibit formation of the biofilm. Furthermore, there was a negligible amount of bacteria on the functionalized PSf membranes (M3-Cl). All the abovementioned results indicate that the functionalized PSf membranes has excellent antifouling and antibacterial properties.",186
833,"Antibacterial properties play an important role on membrane antifouling. However, they usually decrease or disappeare completely as time goes by. Thus, the stability and renewability of the antibacterial membranes are essential for a wide-spread application. The antibacterial mechanism is that the active chlorine would transfer to bacteria in aqueous solution and it would provide a rapid biocidal activity, while at the same time resulting in the change of an N-chloramine group into an amine [46]. So, the renewability of the modified membranes was investigated. The activities of the membranes were quenched through soaking in an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate to mimic the state of the membrane after the antibacterial properties were lost. As shown in Fig. 11, the peak of Cl 2p disappeared. Then, the quenched membranes were treated with NaClO again. It was found that the peak of Cl 2p appeared again. From the results above, it was can be concluded that the functionalized membranes were renewable. (Fig. 12).",161
834,"Membrane fouling has attracted much attention since it is a major obstacle for it's a widespread implementation. Many research studies have been done to modify the PSf membranes and Table 3 summarizes some representative examples. The effective modification in this work has been clearly demonstrated. Through the NIPS process, both the antiadhesive and antibacterial groups moved to membrane surfaces which greatly improved the antibacterial and antifouling properties of the PSf membranes. Both the antibacterial efficiency and the antifouling properties (FRR) of the membranes in this project were superior to those in the listed works. As a comparison, we found the antibacterial properties to be renewable in this work while this was not the case in most other reports.",118
835,"Hydrophilic modification and antibacterial modification are two common methods to reduce membrane biofouling [1-6]. However, each strategy has its drawbacks either as a result of an incapability to inhibit microbe proliferation or due to the lack of ability to reduce the accumulation of dead microbes. In this work, functionalized PSf membranes with combined antibacterial and antifouling properties were fabricated by incorporating amphiliphilic PES-g-PEO-80. The antifouling and antibacterial groups were easily introduced onto membrane surfaces through a nonsolvent induced phase separation process and a simple chlorination process. The hydrophilicity of the functionalized PSf membranes was enhanced and the functionalized membranes were effectively resistant of both protein and bacteria. The functionalized membrane denoted M3-Cl exhibited mostly suppressed irreversible flux decline, in accordance with a flux recovery ratio of 97% after simple washing during the separation process, indicating excellent antifouling properties. Meanwhile, the functionalized PSf membrane presented a high biocidal activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Moreover, the modified functionalized PSf membranes were also found to effectively inhibit biofilm formation, exhibiting excellent antibacterial and antifouling properties. Thus, this combined antibacterial and antifouling modification on membrane surface has great potential in the development of long-term antifouling membranes.",194

837,"Polymeric membranes are widely used in membrane technology [1-6]. Because of the limitations in their chemical and mechanical properties, they often require an extra cross-linking step, either during synthesis [7-10], or as a post-treatment [11-13]. One of the common cross-linking methods for membrane modifications is a chemical reaction between the membrane forming polymer and a multifunctional reagent, like e.g. between polyimides and diamines [7,8,12,14]. However, such approach cannot be applied to prepare stable membranes from chemically less reactive polymers (like e.g. polysulfones (PSUs) or poly(ether ether ketones) (PEEKs)). Therefore, membranes prepared from these kinds of polymers are very often cross-linked by a more drastic treatment like irradiation (e.g. UV, electron beam, or gamma) [15-17]. Apart from that, another strategy involves the synthesis of polymers from these families that carry functional groups [11,16-18]. This polymer is then turned into a membrane, which is later cross-linked by a physical source (e.g. irradiation [16,17]) or via a chemical reaction [11,10].",157
838,"As a result of such cross-linking, membranes with improved chemical stability are thus obtained. However, not only the chemical resistance of a polymeric membrane is altered during this treatment, but very often also the membrane performance [8,12,14,19,20] and morphology [9].",40
839,"As a thermoplastic polymer with high glass transition temperature (Tg) and an absence of reactive groups, PSU seems to be a good candidate for many separation processes that demand a chemically resistant membranes [1]. However, PSU membranes (prepared via phase inversion) are not resistant to many aprotic solvents, and thus are unsuitable for Solvent Resistance Nanofiltration (SRNF) applications in these solvents [1,7,8,12,14]. They are also sensitive to CO2 plasticization in gas separation applications [21-23]. To be suitable for both applications, a further modification of the PSU membrane is necessary via cross-linking. A high-temperature electron-beam irradiation can be implemented [15], but this technique requires expensive electron-beam equipment and, for PESU only works at high temperatures which might damage the membrane structure.",120
840,"The intrinsic photosensitivity of poly(aryl sulfones) [24,25] provides an opportunity to use UV irradiation as a tool to alter a membrane surface by UV grafting of another polymer chain on top of the PSU membrane [6,26]. Up to now, UV light has mainly been used to modify the surface of PSU membranes in order to decrease membrane fouling [27-30], enhance permeability [31], reduce pore size [32], or adjust hydrophilicity [33-35]. This photosensitivity of poly(aryl sulfones) was also used to synthesize UV cross-linked membranes [17]. Heo et al. disclosed a method to prepare a UV cross-linked membrane [17]. In their approach, a UV cross-linkable sulfonated polyethersulfone copolymer comprising double bonds in the backbone of the polymer was synthesized. A solution of it containing benzophenone was cast, directly UV irradiated and afterwards dried. The resulting UV cross-linked copolymer was insoluble in DMF, DMSO, NMP, and boiling water. However, a possible implementation of those membranes in SRNF or GS was not mentioned, and this method cannot be applied for commercial polymers that do not carry the proper reactive groups.",176
841,"In the present study, the details of a very simple way to cross-link membranes made from commercially available PSU polymers, are shown. This recently introduced method [36] involves addition of both the cross-linker and the photoinitiator to the casting solution. Both additives are chosen in such a way that they do not leach out from the polymer matrix to the nonsolvent bath during the NIPS process. The formed membranes are then UV irradiated. An in-depth study on the influence of UV curing on membrane morphology, performance, and solvent stability is performed in this paper.",94
842,"Polysulfone (PSU, Udel(r) P-1700 LCD, Mn 21,000gmol-1) was supplied by Solvay (Belgium). Prior to use, PSU was dried for 24h at 100degC. Table 1 gives an overview of the cross-linkers and the photoinitiator used as additives in the casting solutions. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8% VWR BDH Prolabo), tetrahydrofuran (THF, anhydrous, containing 250ppm BHT as inhibitor, >=99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), toluene (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetone (for HPLC, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), cyclohexanone (>=99%, Sigma-Aldrich), butyl acetate (>=99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethyl acetate (EtOAc, anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), xylenes mixture (ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich), propan-2-ol (IPA, 99.5%, VWR BDH Prolabo), and glycerol (99.5% VWR BDH Prolabo) were all used without further purification. The dye 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2',4',5',7'-tetraiodofluorescein sodium salt (Rose Bengal B (RB), 1017.64gmol-1) was provided by Fluka (Switzerland). A glass plate was applied as the casting substrate to prepare the membranes.",128
843,"The synthesis of UV cured PSU based membranes was performed according to the scheme in Fig. 1. First, the casting solution was prepared, followed by membrane wet casting and finally UV irradiation to obtain a UV modified asymmetric PSU membrane. The detailed fabrication is described below.",46
844,"Asymmetric PSU based membranes were prepared via NIPS. A viscous solution containing 21wt% of PSU in DMF was stirred at 80degC for 3h. Subsequently, the solution was cooled down, and 5wt% of cross-linker, 3wt% of TPO, and THF (with a constant 85/15 DMF/THF ratio) were added and stirred. The compositions of the different casting solutions used are shown in Table 2. After obtaining a homogeneous solution, membranes with variable wet thicknesses of 50, 100, 150, or 200um were cast at a speed of 1.8mmin-1 using an automated casting knife (Braive Instruments, Belgium) [38]. Prior to an immersion into the coagulation bath containing deionized water, the membrane was exposed to air for 30s in order to evaporate the THF and thus create a thin selective layer at the surface of the film. During the casting, the air temperature was 20+-3degC, while the relative humidity was 40+-10%.",145
845,"The PSU membrane cross-linking was performed via UV curing. The UV curable membrane samples were transported through a UV curing unit (Fusion Systems, Inc., USA) at a line speed of 10mmin-1, which was equipped with a D-bulb located above the conveyor belt. The main irradiation light was UVA (320-390nm). The final dose of energy to cure the membranes was 12.3Jcm-2.",60
846,"Following the UV curing, part of the cured PSU membranes was impregnated to improve the mechanical properties (flexibility), filtration properties of the membranes (to avoid pore collapse), as well as to remove as much as possible unreacted species or products formed during the UV irradiation. The impregnation was performed by soaking the membranes for 48h at room temperature in a solution comprising 40% (v/v) of glycerol and 60% (v/v) of propan-2-ol, and subsequently air-dried. A non-impregnated part of the membrane was analyzed by contact angle measurements, ATR-FTIR, and SEM.",89
847,"To investigate the influence of the UV curing sequence in the membrane synthesis on the morphology and membrane performance, part of the casting solutions with SR399LV as a cross-linker and TPO, was cast with a wet thickness of 150, 200, and 300um on the metal plate to form a film. These films were UV irradiated before immersion into the coagulation bath.",61
848,"HPLC-MS (Agilent 1100 Quaternary Pump HPLC and Bruker MS Esquire 3000Plus) was used to determine the solubility of the photoinitiator (PhIn) and the cross-linkers in water. Solutions containing 24.8-251.6ppm of PhIn or cross-linker in 50mL of water were treated under ultrasounds for 5min and filtered through a PVDF filter (0.45um) (Sterlitech). The prepared water solutions were injected in the range of 10uL up to 100uL onto a reverse phase column (Alltech(r) Alltima(tm) C18, 5um, 150mmx3.2mm) kept at 40degC. A mixture of H2O/CH3CN (55:45, v/v%) was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5mLmin-1.",95
849,"The viscosity of the casting solutions was measured with a rotational rheometer (AR-G2, TA Instruments) in cone geometry at 20degC. The shear stress was determined in a range of shear rates up to 300s-1. Each sample was equilibrated at 20degC.",40
850,The hydrophobic properties of the membranes were determined at ambient temperature by static CA measurements using a Drop Shape Analysis System DSA 100 (Kruss) between three phases: dry membrane/air/water drop. The sessile drop method was chosen. The CA of water was measured in equilibrium mode. The CA was measured 8 times for each membrane and is presented in this paper as an average value.,64
851,The conversion of the acrylate double bonds was monitored by an ATR-FTIR spectrometer (BIO-RAD FTS 175 spectrometer using Harrick's ATR SplitPea(tm) with a Si-crystal) with a resolution of 4cm-1. The top and bottom of the membrane was scanned 25 times in the wavenumber range between 4000 and 650cm-1. The conversion was calculated based on the absorbance received for non-cured and UV cured membranes for the CC group at 810cm-1 and the CO group at 1728cm-1.(1)Conversion=(1-(C=CC=O)cured(C=CC=O)non-cured)100,75
852,"The morphologies of the reference (M0), non-cured and UV cured PSU membranes were investigated using SEM (JEOL, JSM 6010 LV) at 5kV. In order to obtain an appropriate cross-section, the specimen were fractured under a liquid nitrogen. Prior to SEM analysis, the specimens were sputtered with gold for 90s using an automated gold coating machine (JEOL, JFC-1300) operating under vacuum.",60
853,The performance of the membranes was evaluated in terms of their solvent resistance and filtration performance. The solvent resistance of the PSU membranes was determined by visual inspection after immersion of small membrane pieces at room temperature for at least 72h in various solvents.,44
854,The filtration performance was investigated by measuring permeate flux and rejection of a dye solution in dead-end mode.,18
855,"Prior to the flux measurements, the membranes were rinsed in IPA for 48h to remove glycerol and to wash out unreacted species.",22
856,"The filtrations were carried out using a high-throughput dead-end filtration module (HTML, Belgium) [38] with 8 filtration cells and an active membrane surface area of each 1.54x10-4m2, mechanically stirred at 300rpm. A solution of 17.5uM RB in IPA was used as feed. The separation was performed under pressures ranging from 5 to 15bar, depending on the membrane. The permeance was calculated as the ratio of collected permeate (V, L) to the active surface area of the membrane (A, m2), collection time (t, h) and applied pressure (p, bar), as in the following equation:(2)Permeance=VAtp,(Lm-2h-1bar-1)The rejection was determined based on the following equation:(3)R=(1-CPCF)100,(%)where CP and CF are the RB concentrations in the permeate and in the feed solution, respectively (umolL-1). The concentration of RB in the permeate was determined by means of UV/vis spectrophotometry at lmax=555nm (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 12 spectrophotometer).",138
857,"To guarantee the presence of the remaining photosensitive additives (PhIn and cross-linkers) in the membrane after the immersion in the coagulation bath, the water solubility of these additives was determined.",30
858,"According to the Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) [39,40] determined for all cross-linkers and the photoinitiator (see SI for more details), these additives do not have much affinity for water (Table 3). The relative energy difference (RED) for all cross-linkers and the photoinitiator with respect to water has quite similar values (RED=1.1-1.4), which is more than 1, reflecting a rather low affinity. However, because of limitations of the HSP theory, especially regarding HSP values of water, an experimental solubility of the studied additives was still performed.",85
859,"Table 3 shows the experimentally determined solubilities of PhIn and cross-linkers in water. TPO showed a very low solubility in water (in agreement with the logP value), while the water solubility generally decreased for the cross-linkers with increasing cross-linker functionality. The highest solubility in water was found for the di-acrylate (Acr2), in agreement with the HSP model (RED close to 1) and its relatively low octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), calculated according to [41]. The other acrylates were only moderately to poorly soluble in water. The rather low solubility of the additives in water, in addition to their quite high viscosity and rather bulky structure (Table 1) suggests that they should mainly remain in the membrane matrix during the NIPS process. The presence of the cross-linker in the membrane after the coagulation step was also proven by ATR-FTIR analysis (Fig. 2; full range spectra in SI). The di-acrylate (non-cured M2 in Fig. 2a) was present in very low amounts in comparison to the penta-acrylate cross-linker (non-cured M5 in Fig. 2b), which suggests some leaching of the smallest cross-linker during the phase inversion process.",182
860,"Additives in the casting solution generally lead to an increase of the casting solution viscosity [42], as defined by the additive's MW and affinity to interact with solvent and polymer [42-44]. Fig. 3 shows the change in viscosity upon addition of cross-linkers with different numbers of functional groups. It is obvious that the viscosity increases with increasing MW of the cross-linker and with the number of functional acrylate groups (Table 1).",71
861,"The reference casting solution comprising only PSU, DMF, and THF, showed a viscosity of 1.1Pas (Fig. 3a). Addition of cross-linker led to a systematic increase of viscosity with rise of cross-linker functionality, up to 1.8Pas for Acr6. This increase is clearly caused by the increase of the MW of the additives, but also by additional additive-polymer-solvent interactions per cross-linker. Similar findings were also found for other low MW additives [44,45].",70
862,"Introduction of the cross-linker did not have any significant impact on the Newtonian behavior of the casting solution (Fig. 3b), although a slight decrease of viscosity was observed with increasing shear rate.",32
863,"Fig. 4 shows a clear influence of the presence of the cross-linkers on the morphology of the UV cured PSU membranes. The reference PSU membrane (Fig. 4a), had a sponge-like structure with only few, very small, round macrovoids in the middle part of the cross-section. However, upon addition of 3wt% of PhIn and 5wt% of cross-linker, the macrovoid-like structure became more pronounced (Fig. 4b-f), despite the increased viscosity of the corresponding casting solutions. The membranes with di- to hexa-acrylate cross-linkers had very similar (almost identical) morphologies and were about 20% thicker than the reference membrane. This difference in membrane thickness was probably caused by the much higher viscosity of the casting solutions loaded with cross-linker and PhIn. Generally, increased casting solution viscosities lead to delayed demixing during the phase inversion and result in a more spongy structure without macrovoids [46]. However, here, an increase of the cross-linker functionality from di- to hexa-acrylate (also increasing the viscosity of the casting solutions) did not supress the macrovoids formation.",166
864,"It seems that the less hydrophobic nature of the cross-linkers, in comparison to PSU (Table 3), plays a crucial role here to induce the instantaneous demixing and that this effect overrules the viscosity impact. According to the HSP calculations (Table 3), the RED for any cross-linker/PSU pair was very close to 1, meaning that there is a low affinity between the cross-linkers and the PSU. Hence, the addition of the cross-linker to the casting solution led to a thermodynamically less stable systems. Since the additives can thus be considered as nonsolvents, demixing will start faster as the solution can be destabilized with less water in the film [1,47]. A similar growth of macrovoids for PSU/DMF membranes was observed by Conesa et al. [48] after addition of low MW additives (i.e. isopropyl myristate and N-hexadecyl-L-hydroxyproline). On the contrary, Holda et al. [44] did not see any macrovoids in a PSU/DMF system containing a set of low MW additives. In that research, different additives, as well as different grades and MWs of PSU were applied, and the membranes were cast on nonwoven supports.",181
865,"The morphology of the UV cured PSU membrane compared to the non-cured membrane was not affected by the UV irradiation, as already described for PSU [36] and PI membranes [8,12,14].",30
866,"Fig. 5 presents the change in hydrophobicity of the PSU membranes upon addition of cross-linkers with various functionality. The addition of any cross-linker decreased the CA. However, there was no clear trend between contact angle and cross-linker functionality nor cross-linker hydrophilicity. The highest CA was expected for the most hydrophilic cross-linker (Acr2). However, despite the relatively high hydrophilicity compared to other cross-linkers (Table 3) and a high cross-linking efficiency in the top part of the membrane (M2 in Fig. 6), this membrane did not show a spectacular decrease of CA. As also mentioned in Section 3.1, a certain proportion of the Acr2 cross-linker indeed leached out from the top surface of the membrane during the NIPS process (Fig. 2). Such leaching would obviously be more pronounced at the very top of the membrane, hence strongly influencing a CA measurements. It can thus be assumed that also for the 4 other acrylates, a dual effect of leaching and intrinsic hydrophilicity is at play.",162
867,"As shown in Fig. 6, there is a difference between the cross-linking efficiency at the top and at the bottom side of the membrane [36]. With most cross-linkers, a top-to-bottom UV cross-linking is not achieved. It is indeed expected that at the top surface, which is directly exposed to the UV irradiation, a higher efficiency is obtained. Therefore, the efficiency of UV curing needs to be tuned by e.g. decreasing the wet thickness of the polymeric film during casting or by changing the sequence in the membrane synthesis. The impact of both methods on membrane morphology is discussed in the section below.",102
868,"Fig. 7 presents the morphological changes induced by varying the membrane thickness in order to adjust the UV curing efficiency. As a rule of thumb, the thickness shrinkage after phase inversion was almost constant for the whole range of the cast film thicknesses (50-200um) used and was equal to about 50% at a casting solution viscosity around 1.7Pas. For a pure PESU membrane, Susanto et al. [49] noticed a thickness shrinkage of 50%, but when the same PESU membrane was loaded with high MW additives, the shrinkage decreased to 29-35%.",90
869,"By increasing the cast film wet thickness from 50 up to 200um (dry from 25 up to 105um), a clear growth of the finger-like macrovoids was observed, which can be explained by the mechanism of macrovoid formation [50]. After the dense top structure of the cast film is formed, it restricts the solvent/nonsolvent exchange rate, which slows down the demixing of the deeper sections across the membrane. Consequently, for the thicker membranes, more time is available for macrovoids to form and grow. A similar appearance of macrovoids with an increase of membrane thickness was also noticed by Conesa et al. [48]. However in that case, the macrovoids increase was observed when increasing the thickness of pure PSU membranes, while membranes with additives showed macrovoids for all applied thicknesses. The appearance and growth of macrovoids with increase of the membrane thickness was also observed by Vogrin et al. [51] for cellulose acetate based membranes, by Li et al. [52] for poly(ether sulfone) and polyimide based membranes, and by Zhou et al. [53] for poly(ether imide) based membranes. In those studies, a so-called critical thickness, above which macrovoids appear, was suggested.",189
870,"Unlike the NIPS/UV membrane synthesis method, the change in synthesis sequence to UV/NIPS resulted in macrovoid-free structures, even for the 200um wet thickness cast membranes (Fig. 8a and b), as also found earlier for polyimide membranes prepared via the same UV/NIPS way [9]. Clearly, the UV irradiation determines the morphology of the membrane and overrules the above mentioned thermodynamic considerations of the phase inversion process. During UV irradiation, cross-linking will indeed appear, thus the viscosity of the cast film will increase and the demixing that is initiated later on by immersion in the nonsolvent will become more delayed, leading to more spongy structures. When thicker films (300um) (Fig. 8c) were cast, small round- and finger-like macrovoids were observed at the bottom of the PSU membrane. In this case, the appearance of the macrovoids at the bottom of the membrane could be caused by insufficient UV light penetration, causing an inhomogeneous increase in viscosity over the whole thickness of the membrane. This viscosity gradient that leave the bottom side of the membrane less viscous, probably led to the formation of these macrovoids at the bottom of the membrane after nonsolvent immersion.",190
871,"With increasing membrane wet thickness, a thickening of the denser membrane skin layer was noticed: from 1um for a 150um wet thickness up to 1.40um for a 300um wet thickness of the cast films (Fig. 8d-f).",36
872,"Compared to the NIPS/UV membranes, the membranes synthesized via the UV/NIPS method had a stronger shrinkage. The shrinkage thus did not follow the rule of thumb: for membranes with wet thicknesses of 150, 200, and 300um, the shrinkages were approximately 70%, 60%, and 50% of the original wet thickness, respectively. The UV irradiation thus influences the membrane morphology, mainly when it is used as the first step in the membrane synthesis.",71
873,"Fig. 11 shows the influence of the cross-linker functionality on the membrane SRNF performance. Addition of the difunctional acrylate (M2) increased the IPA permeance to 1.7Lm-2h-1bar-1 in comparison to the reference PSU membrane (M0), but the RB retention decreased from 93% to 84%. Both the higher permeance and the lower retention for M2 can be caused by the hydrophilic character of the Acr2 cross-linker (Table 3) and possibly by the lower network density after UV curing, since this cross-linker contains only two reactive groups and was assumed to at least partially leach out of the casting solution. Upon addition of tri-, tetra-, penta- or hexafunctional acrylates to the casting solutions, a gradual decrease of IPA permeance and an increase of RB retention was observed. In this case, the lower permeance follows from the increasing UV cross-linking efficiency (Fig. 6) and decreasing leaching. Indeed, when lower amounts of cross-linker are left in the membrane after the coagulation, the cross-linked network is less dense, thus the permeance is higher. Moreover, the increasing retention and decreasing permeance upon addition of cross-linker with higher functionality accompany an increasing thickness of the layer above the macrovoids of these membranes (Fig. 12).",196
874,"The NIPS/UV sequence gave the very high RB retention of 96%, but very low permeance (0.07Lm-2h-1bar-1), M5 in Fig. 11. By reversing the synthesis sequence to the UV/NIPS, a PSU UV/NIPS membrane (with the same composition as M5) with much higher permeances (from 0.6Lm-2h-1bar-1 for M5_150 up to 1.2Lm-2h-1bar-1 for M5_200) was observed. The RB retention decreased from 95% for M5_150 to 84% for M5_200. The high permeance for the UV/NIPS synthesized PSU membranes can be caused by two phenomena. A higher chain mobility during curing of the cast polymer solution in the liquid state can partially fix the PSU matrix already, leaving more voids after the coagulation. Also a lower possibility of cross-linker leaching (i.e. due to the partial UV cross-linking before immersion in water) can lead to a higher final hydrophilicity of the cross-linked membranes with higher affinity to IPA. With increasing wet thickness from 200um to 300um, the UV/NIPS membranes showed a large decrease in permeance (0.7Lm-2h-1bar-1 for M5_300).",162
875,"To prove the efficiency of the UV curing in developing solvent resistant membranes, the reference (M0) and UV treated membranes were immersed in various solvents. Table 4 gives a qualitative observation of the solvent stability of the reference and the UV cured PSU membranes. Both the reference and UV cured PSU membranes were stable at room temperature in acetonitrile, cyclohexane, methanol, propan-2-ol, n-hexane, and n-heptane. The reference membrane (M0) was not stable in most of the other solvents, except in acetone and butyl acetate. In the case of NIPS/UV membranes, membranes containing di- and tri-acrylates (M2 and M3) dissolved in THF and cyclohexanone. M2 swelled excessively in EtOAc and acetone. Possibly, both di- and tri-acrylate cross-linkers did not have a high enough cross-linking density of the network. The NIPS/UV membranes with Acr4-Acr6 in their structure (M4, M5, and M6) clearly exhibited a superior behavior in most applied solvents, especially in THF and cyclohexanone. This finding indicates that for improvement of membrane stability by means of UV irradiation, it is necessary to apply an acrylate with four or more functional groups in order to obtain a sufficient cross-linking density.",188
876,"Membrane M5_150 obtained via UV irradiation before NIPS (UV/NIPS membrane) did not show resistance towards THF. Probably, the UV curing in the highly diluted state of the polymer solution, before coagulation, left many acrylates, incompletely reacted, thus not forming a sufficiently strong network. However, in all other solvents, a stability was comparable to that of the M4-M6 NIPS/UV membranes. Considering the good SRNF-performance of these UV/NIPS membranes also opens interesting prospects for this sequence of membrane preparation.",77

880,"Non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) is a commonly used method for preparing polymeric membranes. In this technique, a homogeneous polymer solution is spread onto a glass plate and subsequently immersed in a non-solvent water bath. The diffusional exchange between non-solvent and solvent causes phase separation of polymer solution (the polymer poor phase gives rise to the pores, while the polymer rich phase forms the porous matrix), which to a degree reduces the Gibbs free energy of system. Moreover, it is well recognized that except for the thermodynamics of polymer solution, kinetic behaviors also play a key role in the membrane structure and properties. Factors related to the membrane formation process contain the polymer concentration [1], solvents and additives types [2,3], additives dosage [4] and hollow fiber membrane spinning or flat sheet membrane casting parameters such as air gap, bore fluid component [5], temperature and component of coagulation bath [6] and take-up speed [7].",153
881,"Among numerous approaches used to tailor membranes morphology and performance, the introduction of appropriate additives to the polymer solutions is an effective and convenient strategy. Commonly used additive in polymer solution can be classified into three general categories: (a) organic additives, such as amphiphilic copolymers (polyacrylonitrile-graft-poly(ethyleneoxide) (PAN-g-PEO) [8], Pluronic F127 [9]), hydrophilic polymers (polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) [10], polyethylene glycol (PEG) [11]), surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) [12], Tween 80 [13]); (b) inorganic additives, such as inorganic salts (lithium chloride (LiCl) [14], zinc chloride (ZnCl2) [15]), inorganic nanomaterials (titanium dioxide (TiO2) [16], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [17], graphene oxide (GO) [18]); (c) non-solvent additives, such as ethanol [19], water [20].",108
882,"In recent years, the dual-function of additives as pore formers as well as surface modifiers have made them attractive for membrane fabrication, for instance GO [21] and amphiphilic copolymer Pluronic F127 [9]. However, the aggregation of GO in the casting solutions could induce the negative impact on membrane properties [22]. Additionally, Pluronic F127 were only able to act as surface modifiers and pore formers when added to the casting solution in comparatively sizable amounts, leading to a decrease in the modification efficiency of membrane [9]. SPSf is widely used hydrophilic membrane materials, because of its excellent physical and chemical properties including high oxidation and thermal stabilities [23]. A small amount of SPSf can be firmly retained with the membrane matrix as a surface modifier and pore former. Dosage is little but effect is great.",134
883,"The objective of this study is to tailor PES UF membrane with improved permeance and separation performance of dye/salt mixture using NIPS method via the synergetic effect or gelation of SPSf and H2O. The synergistic effect between SPSf and H2O on the membrane microstructure and properties was explored by comprehensive experimental and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. Moreover, the separation performance for different molecular weight dyes and dye/salt mixture of the membrane were investigated. The synergistic effect between SPSf and H2O was proposed for the first time, which disclosed the mechanism of interaction between SPSf and H2O as well as its influence on the membrane morphology and performance.",107

The mass ratio of PES to SPSf in PES/SPSf polymer solutions was 84:16 wt/wt. Then H2O was gradually titrated into homogeneous polymer solutions until precipitation occurred.

The membrane was precompacted for 1 h at 1.5 bar then maintained at 1.0 bar to achieve a consistent water permeance. Membrane separation performance towards model solutes (dyes, PEG and sucrose) was conducted by solvating each model solute in pure water (0.1 g/L) and prefiltrated for 1 h prior to testing the model solute rejection and permeance. Membrane filtration of CR/Na2SO4 mixture was accomplished at 0.1 g/L CR content combined with various Na2SO4 concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, 40 g/L) in pure water. The permeance of pure water and CR/Na2SO4 mixture were calculated from:(1)J=VTxAwhere V is volume of the permeate (L), T is the filtration time (h) and A is the operative area of membrane (m2).",128
891,"The model solute rejection (R) of membrane was calculated using Eq. (2):(2)R(%)=(1-CpCf)x100where Cf is concentration of the model solute in the feed and Cp is the concentration of the model solute in the permeate. The dye concentration was investigated via UV-Vis spectrophotometry (UH4150, Hitachi). The concentration of PEG and sucrose was assessed by the use of total organic carbon (TOC) (TOC-L, CPH, Shimadzu).",63
892,"Viscosity is a key property of polymer solutions due to its influence on the phase inversion process and thereby the resultant membrane structure. Fig. 1(a) showed the casting solutions viscosity increased from 1350 mPa s (M1) to 1800 mPa s (M2) with the addition of H2O. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: the cloud point value of PES/DMAc casting solution (M1) obtained from the phase diagram determination experiment is 4.18 g, which is higher than the mass of water added to M2 (3.5 g). That is to say, pre-addition of this amount of H2O into the PES/DMAc casting solution would induce the pregelation, which in turn increased resistance to shear-induced deformation [20].",113
893,"Further, the viscosity of M3 (1900 mPa s) is higher than that of M1 as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The higher viscosity was not only due to the higher molecular weight of SPSf but also attributed to the stronger intermolecular and intramolecular interactions among PES, SPSf and DMAc. It is worth noting that the solubility parameter of DMAc, SPSf and PES was 22.7, 20.7 and 10.7 (cal/cm3)1/2 [28], respectively. This demonstrated that the solubility parameter of DMAc is closer to SPSf than that of PES. It implied that DMAc displays a better solvency to dissolve SPSf as well as PES-SPSf, SPSf-SPSf and SPSf-DMAc interactions [17,32]. Additionally, it also can be observed from Fig. 1(a) that the casting solutions viscosity substantially increased from 1350 mPa s (M1) to 2650 mPa s (M4) with the addition of SPSf and H2O. Except for the above mentioned reasons, another important reason was the hydrogen bonding interaction between H2O and SPSf. To further support the above findings, Raman analysis of the M3 as well as M4 casting solutions was performed as presented in Fig. 1(b).",180
894,"As described in Fig. 1(b), the peak at 1152 cm-1 corresponded to C-S stretching vibration mode of SPSf in M3 [33]. Nevertheless, the C-S stretching vibration peak achieved from SPSf in M4 occurred at 1149 cm-1, with a transition from 1152 to 1149 cm-1 when H2O was introduced to the polymer solution. This occurrence in M4 was due to the electron cloud deformation in -SO3- groups of SPSf induced by the hydrogen bonding interaction between H2O and -SO3- groups, thus resulting in a weakness to C-S interaction (Fig. 1(c)) [34].",90
895,"In addition, the phase diagram was utilized to further compare the thermodynamic stability between PES/DMAc and PES/SPSf/DMAc casting solutions. Fig. 1(d) showed the cloud points of PES/DMAc/H2O and PES/SPSf/DMAc/H2O mixtures. The more H2O the polymer solution could tolerate, the better its thermodynamic stability [27]. It can be seen in Fig. 1(d) that the cloud point curve of PES/DMAc/H2O mixture was closer to the solvent-polymer axis than that achieved from the PES/SPSf/DMAc/H2O mixture. This implied that more H2O was required to the precipitate of PES/SPSf casting solution. That is to say, the PES/SPSf/DMAc casting solution thermodynamic properties were more stable. The reason was that the -SO3- groups of SPSf could combine with water molecules through hydrogen bonding interaction thus enhancing the tolerance of polymer molecules toward water in the casting solution [32]. The polymer solution thermodynamic properties are associated with the phase equilibrium between the components of the polymer solution, which plays an important role in the morphology and properties of membrane.",161
896,"To study the synergy of SPSf and H2O on the morphologies of PES based membranes, the cross-section and top-surface structures of the resultant membranes were showed in Fig. 2. It could be observed in Fig. 2 that each membrane possessed a dense top-surface and supporting layer. Clearly, four membranes exhibited different supporting layers. As demonstrated in Fig. 2(a), M1 displayed an asymmetric structure with dense skin layer, finger-like middle layer and honeycomb porous bottom layer. Compared with M1, the finger-like structure of M2 was partially inhibited and more honeycomb porous supporting structure appeared because of the relatively large viscosity of M2 polymer solution, which hindered the diffusional exchange between water and DMAc during the phase inversion process [35].",118
897,"An interesting phenomenon is that M4 exhibited a completely different structure, i.e. an entirely sponge-like structure in Fig. 2(d) as the simultaneous addition of SPSf and H2O. The reason was that the hydrogen bonding interaction between H2O and SPSf induced a three-dimensional network formation, which enhanced the gelation degree as well as the viscosity of M4. Eventually the macrovoids and finger-like structure were completely suppressed [39]. Although M2 also experienced gelation with the pre-addition of water, the casting solution viscosity was relatively low and the nuclear phase still aggregated easily, contributing to the formation of a small amount of finger-like structure owning to the low gelation degree.",107
898,"In sum, the addition of SPSf and water into the casting solution affected the thermodynamics behaviors and kinetics of membrane formation, finally resulting in the differently structured membranes and performance, which will be discussed in subsequent sections.",37
899,"Mechanical performance plays a vital role in the membranes practical application especially the cleaning effectiveness and shelf life of the membranes. Table 2 showed the mechanical strength of membranes increased from 9.3 MPa (M1) to 11.7 MPa (M2). The phenomenon was as a result of finger-like structure suppression due to addition of H2O in the polymer solution as described in Fig. 2. The membranes mechanical properties are dependent on both the intrinsic strength of the membrane materials and the robustness of the membrane structure [43]. The density of M2 is greater than that of M1, resulting in the membrane with a higher breaking strength. Similarly, the breaking strength of M4 (6.9 MPa) is higher than that of M3 (5.0 MPa). Nevertheless, when SPSf was added to the polymer solution, the breaking strength of membrane decreased from 9.3 MPa (M1) to 5.0 MPa (M3). This reduction may be attributed to the introduction of the strong polar -SO3- groups into the polymer chains. These groups reduced the aggregative state and expanded the polymer matrix, allowing for chain movements and flexibility [26].",179
900,"Moreover, the membrane water contact angle further reduced from 72.6deg (M3) to 65.3deg (M4). The decline in contact angle was attributed to the improved SPSf surface coverage (phs) on the surface of resultant membrane. The computation method for phs could be obtained from our previous work, which originated from the data of XPS analysis [27]. The phs of M3 and M4 were 63.9% and 82.6%, respectively. Clearly, the water contact angle is in good agreement with the phs.",78
901,"To further understand how the addition of water enhanced phs, MD simulation was performed to explore the effect of water on the interaction energy between SPSf and PES (EPES-SPSf) in the blending system. The EPES-SPSf of PES/SPSf and PES/SPSf/H2O blending systems were 203.5 and 71.3 kcal/mol, respectively. This implied that the addition of water to the blending system weakened the interaction between PES and SPSf polymer chains, leading to fewer entanglement of polymer chains (Fig. 5). Thus, SPSf were more likely to segregate at the interface between the water bath and polymer solution during the phase inversion process, resulting in more -SO3- groups to cover the surface of membrane as well as a higher phs [34].",116
902,"It is noted that M4 presented superior water permeance (110.4 L/m2 h bar) over the other three control membranes. This improvement in water permeance was as a result of the synergy between SPSf and H2O, which not only improved the membrane hydrophilicity but also increased the membrane surface pore size and top surface porosity. The average surface pore size and top surface porosity of M4 (3.4 nm and 7.6%) is larger than that of M3 as demonstrated in Table 2. The phenomenon can be explained as follows: the -SO3- groups of SPSf combined with the pre-added water molecules (water additive) in the M4 casting solution through hydrogen bonding. Therefore, these water molecules surrounded by -SO3- groups formed water clusters. After membrane formation the space occupied by the water clusters formed pores, leading to the increase of membrane surface pore size and top surface porosity as described in Fig. 5. In addition, a decline in the surface selection layer thickness of membranes (Fig. 3) would also result in an increase in the water permeance.",173
903,"As mentioned, PES/SPSf blend membrane (M4) as a sample was performed to investigate its separation performance for different molecular weight dyes and neutral molecules as demonstrated in Fig. 7. Obviously, M4 exhibited a low rejection for the model neutral molecules such as sucrose (0%), PEG 400 (0%) and PEG 1000 (9.3%), which is attributed to molecular sieving mechanism. In other word, the molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of M4 is much larger than that of the above neutral molecules. Indeed, the MWCO of M4 obtained from PEG rejection was approximately 16.8 kDa (Fig. S4). Similarly, the rejection of MO (327.3 Da) with negative charge (Table S1) by M4 was 18.7 %, which was ascribed to the electrostatic repulsion and a certain amount of adsorption. As shown in Fig. S5, the zeta potential of M4 was -33.8 mV at pH = 7.",141
904,"Additionally, it can be also found from Fig. 7 that the rejection of AF (585.0 Da), CR (696.7 Da), BBR (825.5 Da) and EB (960.8 Da) were high up to 90.1%, 99.2%, 99.9% and 99.0%, respectively. The following reasons can be used to explain the phenomenon. On the one hand, the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface and inside pore of membrane would foul and even block membrane pores, leading to the enhancement of dye rejection (the dye adsorption capacity of M4 were presented in Fig. S6) [47]. On the other hand, various factors including dye hydration, steric hindrance effect, agglomeration, electrostatic repulsion (the four kinds of dyes with a negative charge as described in Table S1) as well as concentration polarization would contribute to the membrane with a high rejection for dyes [48].",135
905,"Moreover, the separation performance of commercially used membranes and others for dye wastewater treatment reported in literature are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3 that the PES/SPSf membrane (M4) exhibited both relatively high permeance and high rejection for dyes even under a very low operation pressure of 1.0 bar.",54
906,"From the viewpoint of practical application, the separation stability of the membrane is a very important consideration for long-term use. A 50 h continuous filtration test for M4 was performed with CR/Na2SO4 mixture (0.1 g/L CR and 5 g/L Na2SO4) under 1 bar to investigate the membrane separation stability as shown in Fig. 9. The permeance of M4 declined slightly from 76.2 L/m2 h bar to 70.5 L/m2 h bar (only 7.48 % decay) during the 50 h continuous filtration period. Moreover, CR and Na2SO4 rejection of the membrane remained stable throughout the operation time. The rejection of CR and Na2SO4 after 50 h filtration time was 97.8% and 3.7%, respectively. These results indicated that M4 possessed good long-term stability performance.",121
907,"The PES-based UF membrane with sponge-like structure and enhanced water permeance properties was successfully prepared by NIPS using SPSf and H2O as additives in the casting solution. The synergy between SPSf and H2O affects the PES-based UF membrane structure and performance by influencing the thermodynamics of polymer solution and phase separation kinetics of the membrane formation. The hydrogen bonding interaction between H2O and SPSf enhanced the gelation degree as well as the viscosity of M4 polymer solution (PES/SPSf/H2O/DMAc), resulting in the formation of an entirely sponge-like structure. Specifically, M4 possessed a high pure water permeance of 110.4 L/m2 h bar compared to 0.13 L/m2 h bar of M1 (PES/DMAc). It is also found that the membrane average surface pore size and top surface porosity increased from 1.3 nm and 3.1% (M1) to 3.4 nm and 7.6% (M4), and the membrane water contact angle reduced from 83.1deg (M1) to 65.3deg (M4). Comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the synergistic effect between SPSf and water was responsible for the enhanced membrane surface pore size, top surface porosity and hydrophilicity, leading to the improved pure water permeance. Additionally, M4 exhibited a good selectivity for dye and salt mixture.",196

913,"The use of nanomaterials as membrane fillers is one of the well-established methods being developed in membrane sector [7]. The addition of nanofillers can improve membrane performance and properties like antifouling, antibacterial activity, flux, and rejection [8]. Various nanomaterials have been investigated as membrane nanofillers and exhibited high performance such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [9], zeolites [10], metal organic frame works (MOFs) [11], graphene-based materials [12,13], SiO2 [14], MXene [15], TiO2 [16], etc. Among them, graphene oxide (GO) and GO-based materials attracted remarkable research interest in the past few years due to their stability, tuneability, mechanical strength, and easy accessibility [17]. Furthermore, GO-based materials exhibit high fouling resistance and bactericidal effects against various foulants and bacteria making them promising nanofillers to produce high antifouling membranes [18,19]. Additionally, the oxygen content in the functional groups (e.g. hydroxyls, carboxyls, ketones and epoxides) existing on the GO sheets edges enriches GO hydrophilicity and make it a versatile platform for further functionalization to derive other graphene-based materials to meet different purposes [20,21]. Furthermore, GO can be easily exfoliated in various polymer matrices and polar aprotic solvents [22] which makes it a good candidate to be utilized as nanofiller in membranes fabrication sector.",198
914,"In this work, amine-functionalized GO nanoparticles were prepared and used as nanofiller in UF polysulfone (PSF) composite membranes. The amination of GO was carried out using the direct functionalization of GO nanosheets with DDA via a simple temperature-assisted reflux method. We aim through this study to investigate the synergetic effects of GO and DDA on the antifouling properties and the bactericidal activity of PSF composite membranes. Pristine GO and rGO-DDA nanosheets were incorporated into PSF via the non-solvent induced phase separation technique (NIPS) at low concentrations (0-0.15 wt.%). The dynamic fouling resistance of the fabricated membranes was investigated against organic and protein fouling represented by humic acid (HA) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), respectively. The antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes against Halomonas aquamarina (H. aquamarina) as the model bacterium was studied using bacteriostasis rate determination approach. The effect of GO and rGO-DDA incorporation on the PSF morphology, hydrophilicity, permeability and separation efficiency was investigated, too. Moreover, the structural and spectral properties of GO and rGO-DDA were studied.",168

In brief, a mixture of 24 mL of H2SO4 and 6 mL of H3PO4 was stirred in an ice bath for several minutes. 1 g of Gr flakes and 3 g of KMnO4 were then added into mixing solution under the same conditions. The reactants were then stirred at 95 +- 2 degC in an oil bath for 30 min followed by the addition of 50 mL deionized water (DI) and stirring for another 30 min at the same conditions. The reaction was then terminated by adding DI (150 mL) and H2O2 (20 mL). The mixture was then diluted with HCl (20 %) and centrifuged, followed by several washing/centrifugation cycles with DI until obtaining a neutral pH. GO nanoparticles were then obtained by drying the samples overnight at 80 degC.",144

In brief, 100 mg of GO were dispersed in DI (50 mL) and 300 mg of DDA were dispersed in ethanol (50 mL) and both solutions were then ultrasonicated for 1 h. Both GO and DDA suspensions were mixed in a round bottom flask and stirred in an oil bath (60 degC, 48 h) under the reflux conditions. The aminated GO (rGO-DDA) nanoparticles were then obtained by the solvent evaporation technique followed by several washings with ethanol followed by vacuum drying at 85 degC overnight. A schematic representation of the GO synthesis, the amination reaction with DDA and the anticipated structure of rGO-DDA is presented in Fig. 1.",124
918,"The properties of the synthesized GO and rGO-DDA nanoparticles were analyzed using different characterization techniques to investigate the contribution of oxidation conditions as well as the functionalization reaction to the properties of both samples. The elemental compositions were obtained by the CHNSO elemental analyzer (Flash 2000, Thermo Scientific(tm)). FTIR spectra were recorded using Perkin Elmer 2000 FTIR-UATR spectrometer in the range of 400 - 4000 cm-1. DXR Raman Spectrometer with a 532 nm laser and a 10x objective (Thermo Scientific) was used to obtain Raman spectra at room temperature. The morphological structures of GO and rGO-DDA were evaluated using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with FEI Tecnai F20 (200 kV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using JEOL model JSM-6390LV.

920,"To investigate the effect of GO incorporation into the PSF matrix, the prepared membranes were characterized using FTIR-UATR (Perkin Elmer 2000). Surface and cross-section SEM images at different magnifications were obtained using (JEOL model JSM-6390LV). The preparation of cross-section samples was done by freezing the membrane samples in liquid nitrogen and then fracturing them to prevent the deformation of the membranes structure [45,46]. The surface roughness of the prepared membranes in terms of the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) and average roughness (Ra) were evaluated using the Atomic force microscopy (AFM-MFP-3D) from Asylum Research, US. AFM images were obtained over a scan area of 5 x 5 mm with 1 Hz scan rate. Membranes hydrophilicity in terms of water contact angle (CA) was measured with a DataPhysics contact angle analyzer (OCA15 Pro, Germany). The CA measurements were conducted using DI droplets of 2 mm at minimum of 15 points of each membrane.",150

The samples were then kept in DI overnight at room temperature, excess water was then carefully mopped with a tissue paper and weighted immediately (ww). The samples were dried overnight and the dry membrane weight (wd) was then recorded. The membrane porosity was then estimated using Eq. 1 [27,47] :(1)e=ww-wdAxlxrwWhere A (cm2) is the effective membrane area, l (cm) is the membrane thickness determined from the cross-section SEM images, and rw is the density of water at 23 degC (0.998 g/cm3).

All filtration experiments were performed at 1 bar, 46.1 +- 0.3 cm.s-1 cross-flow velocity and a temperature of 23 +- 0.5 degC. Briefly, the membrane was firstly compacted with DI for 30 min at 4 bar. The pressure was then reduced to 1 bar and kept for additional 30 min to ensure a stable flux. The pure water flux (Jw0, LMH) and permeability (PWP, LMH/bar) of membranes were then calculated using Eqs.

After foulants filtration, the feed was shifted back to DI for membrane washing. Three washing cycles (10 min each) were performed without an applied pressure at 46.1 +- 0.3 cm.s-1 cross-flow velocity.

H. aquamarina were used as the model bacterium. 16 mg of the PSF, PSF/GO and PSF/rGO-DDA were cut and washed with ethanol then with DI to remove ethanol residuals. Membrane samples were then added to 10 mL of Luria Bertani (LB) solution incubated with appropriate volume of Halomonas to obtain initial optical density of 0.1 at 600 nm (OD600). Samples were then incubated at 30 degC for 18 h after which they were removed from cultures and rinsed with saline.

925,"Photographs of GO and rGO-DDA dispersions just after sonication are shown in Fig. 6. GO showed good degree of dispersion in DI, DMF, DMA and NMP. However, in dodecane, toluene and hexane, the dispersion was very poor which agrees with other studies in the literature [23,61]. In comparison, rGO-DDA exhibited higher dispersibility in all solvents except in DI. The poor dispersion of rGO-DDA in DI can be related to the reduction of the oxygen along with the alkyl chain addition to the GO structure [22] which reduces the hydrophilicity of GO sheets. The good dispersion of rGO-DDA in other solvents allows it utilization as membrane filler with various types of polymers (PSF, PVDF, PES, PAN, etc.) and for different applications (UF, NF, FO and RO). However, the limited dispersion properties of the raw GO restrict its usage for such applications [24].",141
926,"FTIR-UATR spectra of the control PSF, PSF/GO and PSF/rGO-DDA composite membranes are presented in Fig. 7. The PSF characteristic bands are presented in all spectra around 1664, 1320, 1291, 1241, 1150, 1108 cm-1 corresponding to aromatic ring breathing, OSO asymmetric stretching, SO stretching, COC stretching, OSO symmetric stretching, and SO stretching. The two bands around 1586 and 1487 cm-1 correspond to the aromatic ring stretching. These bands have been previously reported with PSF membranes [65,66]. The spectra of the composite membranes are almost identical to this of the pristine PSF and depict no difference which can be related to the dominance of PSF and the low concentrations of nanofillers in the polymer matrix [67].",114
927,"The membrane separation and antifouling properties are also affected by the surface roughness [70]. Therefore, AFM analysis was employed to investigate the effects of GO and rGO-DDA embedding on the surface roughness. The 3D AFM images over 5 x 5 mm scan area and roughness parameters of the tested membranes are shown in Fig. 11 and Table 3, respectively. The results show a clear increase in the surface roughness with the high concentrations of pristine GO while it remains the same with low concentrations of GO (e.g. 0.02 %). The roughness parameters of the neat PSF were 7.1 and 5.7 nm for RMS and Ra, respectively, that increased up to 16 and 11.5 nm with 0.15 wt.% GO. When comparing PSF and GO-based membranes with rGO-DDA-based membranes, RMS and Ra were found to decrease with rGO-DDA addition indicating that rGO-DDA based membrane were apparently smoother than the neat PSF and GO-based MMMs. It well known that membranes with rough surfaces have higher fouling propensity because of the accumulation of foulants in the surface valleys [67,71], while membranes with smoother surface have higher fouling resistance capability [72].",186
928,"Water contact angle (CA) of the prepared membranes was measured to investigate the effect of GO and rGO-DDA embedding on PSF hydrophilicity and is presented in Fig. 12. The results show a slight enhancement in the hydrophilicity with the embedding of pristine GO as the CA decreased from 83.5deg with PSF to 75.5deg with GO-0.15. The hydrophilicity enhancement with GO addition is attributed to the GO hydrophilicity which was observed and reported in several studies [67,73]. In contrast, rGO-DDA based MMMs exhibited less hydrophilicity than GO based MMMs. The average CA of rGO-DDA based membranes were close to this of the pristine PSF and were in the range of 81.9deg - 83.1deg. This agrees with the characterization results of rGO-DDA that showed a hydrophobic nature of rGO-DDA compared to unfunctionalized GO.",131
929,"As depicted in Fig. 13, a complete rejection of both HA and BSA was observed with the pristine PSF and all the GO and rGO-DDA composite membranes. Figure S4 in the supplementary information presents photographs of feed and permeate samples taken during HA separation experiments. The high rejection can be mainly linked to main mechanisms: the molecular size exclusion mechanism that retain large molecules like HA and BSA accompanied with the charge-based mechanisms that enhances the electrostatic repulsion of foulant molecules with the negatively charged membranes [38,80]. Similar results were obtained with other GO-based MMMs investigated in the literature like PES/SPSF/GO [80], PSF/GO [67], PSF/GO-PDA [27], PES/CSGO [36], PSF/GOQD [81], and SPES/GO-SiO2-NH2 [38].",113
930,"It is well known that the reversible fouling ratio (Rr) of a membrane is highly affected by its surface hydrophilicity and roughness [82]. As confirmed by the AFM analysis, rGO-DDA based membranes have relatively smoother surfaces than PSF and GO-based membranes. Therefore, the accumulation of foulants is restricted and can be washed easily from the surface during the washing cycles. In contrast, GO-based membranes showed higher surface roughness than this of the pristine PSF and rGO-DDA based membranes. Hence, surface roughness enhances the accumulation of foulant molecules in the valleys which cause a significant reduction in the flux during the foulant filtration stage. In the next stage (washing with DI), the hydrophilic nature of GO nanoparticles, distributed on the membrane surface and within the membrane pores, induces the removal and washing of foulants with water [82,83]. Therefore, the fouling resistance was enhanced with GO embedding regardless the high surface roughness, which agrees with some studies in the literature [38,70,84]. Taken together, the findings herein suggest that the fouling resistance of the composite membranes were enhanced by the hydrophilicity in case of the pristine GO addition, and by the lower surface roughness in case of rGO-DDA addition.",196
931,"Figures S5 and S6 in the supplementary information present SEM images for some fouled membranes at magnification of 10,000 x at two different locations on the surface with BSA and HA, respectively. Figure S7 in the supplementary information shows microphotographs of HA-fouled membranes at two different locations on the surface. Both SEM images and microphotographs confirm the higher fouling resistance of GO and rGO-DDA based MMMs compared to the bare PSF.",71
932,"Table 4 compares the performance of GO-0.1, GO-0.15, rGO-DDA-0.1 and rGO-DDA-0.15 with other GO-based UF MMMs in literature in terms of PWP, rejection, FRR, and bacteriostasis rate. Most of these membranes were prepared using polyethersulfone (PES) as the main polymeric material while PSF, PVDF, PVC and PEI were used in some studies. Obviously, GO-0.1 and GO-0.15 lies in the range of other GO-based membranes in literature with respect to FRR and rejection. rGO-DDA-0.1 and rGO-DDA-0.15 showed higher FRR against both foulants with pure water flux in the range of other recently reported GO-based membranes. Some literature reported high flux GO-based membranes (>300 L. m-2. h-1. bar-1) [47,70,73,82,91], but these membranes have either low FRR or low rejection.",117
933,"In this work, the potential use of rGO-DDA as membrane nanofiller was investigated. GO nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and functionalized with DDA as revealed by the characterization results and formed rGO-DDA. rGO-DDA was found to have better dispersion properties in several organic solvent. However, it showed poor dispersion in water caused by its hydrophobic nature. The effect of rGO-DDA on the flux, rejection, antifouling, and antibacterial properties of PSF MMMs was also investigated. The incorporation of GO and rGO-DDA was performed via sonication and direct mixing followed by casting using the NIPS technique. Results obtained from membrane characterizations confirmed the successful incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric matrix of PSF. The synthesized membranes exhibited different characteristics with respect to morphology, hydrophilicity, porosity and mean pore size. Surface roughness increased with GO addition, while membrane surface became smoother with rGO-DDA addition. Hydrophilicity was also found to increase with GO addition due to its hydrophilic nature. In contrast, due to the hydrophobic characteristics of rGO-DDA, no obvious change on hydrophilicity of PSF was recorded with the addition of rGO-DDA.",177

938,"The key point to design such selective membranes is the construction of nanopores below 3 nm with chemical functional pore walls [17]. To date, many attempts to create charged nanochannels have focused on the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of polyelectrolytes. For example, a typical assembly of polystyrene sulfonate and poly(allylamine) hydrochloride has been reported to prepare a selective membrane with charged nanopores [18]. However, due to the required multistep procedures, the LbL assembly is inefficiency in practical application. Besides, the membrane structures are unstable during long-term service and the charge property can be affected by the loss of packing layer.",99
939,"As an alternative choice, amphiphlic polymers are attracting much attention in functional materials due to their potential advantages meanwhile endowing the corresponding materials with structure stability, mechanical strength and specific functionality. It should be reasonable to expect that NFMs can be fabricated from amphiphlic polymers via proper methods. For an amphiphlic polymer, theoretically, the microphase domains of hydrophilic components can act as the nanochannels with particular permeation and rejection performance.",70
940,"Based on the authors' previous researches [19-21], a random amphiphilic polymer, sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) with a rational design of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments (shown in Fig. S1) was appropriate to explore a new method for negatively-charged NFMs. Because of the suitable dispersibility and stability in aqueous phase, SPSF can be prepared into polymer nanoparticles. Microphase separated domains can be formed by the packing of SPSF nanoparticles on a substrate and the interstices between the microphase separated domains can serve as charged nanochannels.",83
941,"Different to ever reported Non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) for membrane preparation [22,23], in this study, a coating-heating route of SPSF aqueous polymer nanoparticles was proposed for fabricating the negatively-charged NFMs. By using PES ultrafiltration (UF) membranes as the substrates, several NFMs with NCNs were obtained. The structure, formation mechanism, charge property and salt rejection of the prepared NFMs were investigated in detail.",63
942,"Sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF, IEC = 1.91 meq/g, [e] > 0.6 dL/g) with a degree of sulfonation (DS) of 50% was synthesized in laboratory. Polyethersulfone (PES) membranes with different Molecular Weight Cut-Off (MWCO, 10 kDa, 20 kDa and 50 kDa) were purchased from Beijing Separate Equipment Co., Ltd. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc, 99.0%), sodium sulfate (>=99.0%), magnesium sulfate (>=99.0%), sodium chloride (>=99.0%) and magnesium chloride (>=99.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different molecular weights (400, 600, 1000, 2000, 4000 Da) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Deionized (DI) water (PH  6.5) was used in all experiments.",103
943,"The NFMs was fabricated as follows: First, a SPSF solution in DMAc (5 wt%) was dropwise added to DI water under vigorous stirring and ultrasound to form homogeneous dispersion of SPSF nanoparticles in aqueous phase. Then, the aqueous SPSF nanoparticles was casted onto a PES membrane (5 x 10-4 g/cm2) and followed by heat-treatment at 80 degC for 10 min, yielding a dense SPSF layer with NCNs on the subatrate (Fig. 1). To investigate the influence of substrate, the PES UF membranes with different MWCO was used, and the resultant NFMs was named as NM@UF10K, NM@UF20K, NM@UF50K, respectively. Control sample was prepared from the PES-10K UF membrane without adding SPSF nanoparticles.",111
944,"Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used for studying the morphologies of the polymer nanoparticles on the copper net. The hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials of the SPSF nanoparticles were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano Series, Malvern Instruments) at 25 degC. Measurements were made at a fixed angle at 90deg and a wavelength of 657 nm with a 1 mm entrance aperture. The morphologies of the SPSF nanoparticles were also observed using a Hitachi S4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) on a silicon wafer after gold-sputtering. The chemical structures of the SPSF nanoparticles were further confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy on a Bruker vector 22 FT-IR spectrometer.",117
945,"The surface and cross-section morphologies of the membranes were observed by FESEM after gold-sputtering. The surface roughness was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode on a SPI-3800N controller. The surface charge property was measured via a streaming potential method (Zeta potential) on an electrokinetic analyzer. 10 mM KCl solution was used through the determination of zeta potential, and the pH was adjusted automatically by adding NaOH and HCl into KCl solution. The surface zeta potential z was determined by Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation [20].",85
946,"Nanopore size and its distribution of the membranes were measured by the solute transport method based on the correlation between solute sizes and solute rejection rates. Observed solute rejection rates were calculated by the equation:(1)R=(1-CpCf)x100%where R is the percent solute rejection, and Cp and Cf (mg/L) are the concentrations of solute in the permeate and feed, respectively. In this study, feed solutions containing 300 ppm of different molecular weights of PEG (400, 600, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Da) were used to characterize nanopore size and its distribution of the membranes. The Stokes diameter (nm) of the PEG in the feed solutions at a given molecular weight can be calculated from the following equation [24]:(2)d = 33.46 x 10-12 x M0.557",120
947,"The solute rejection rate of the membrane is plotted as a function of the solute Stokes diameter based on the log-normal distribution. The geometric mean diameter of solute (ms) at R = 50% and the solute geometric standard deviation (ss) defined as the ratio of the Stokes diameter at R = 84.13% over that at R = 50% can be determined according to the obtained straight line equation. The mean effective pore size (mp) and the geometric standard deviation (sp) of the membrane can be considered to be the same as the ms and ss if the steric and hydrodynamic interactions between solute and membrane pores are disregarded. Therefore, based on the mp and sp, the pore size distribution of the membrane can be expressed by the probability density function as shown in the following equation [25]:(3)dR(rp)drp=1rplnsp2pexp[-(lnrp-lnmp)22(lnsp)2]where rp is the pore size of the membrane.",145
948,"Membrane performance tests were conducted on a 47 mm diameter Amicon UFcell (XFUF04701 Millipore) at 25 degC with an effective filtration area of 15 cm2 and a cell volume of 300 ml under 0.4 Mpa. The pure water flux of the fabricated membranes was determined by employing DI water as the feed and was subsequently calculated according to the following equation:(4)F=VA*Dtwhere V is the volume of the water or solution permeated during the experiment (L), A represents the effective membrane area (m2) and Dt denotes the operation time (h). Solute rejection rate was determined based on Eq. (1) as previously mentioned. DI water with added inorganic salts (Na2SO4, NaCl, MgSO4 and MgCl2 respectively) at a concentration of 1000 ppm was used as the feed.",124
949,"The surface morphologies of the NFMs were different from each other. That might be due to the diffenent surface morphologies of the pristine substrates, which should have a significant impact on the surface homogeneity of the final NFMs.",38
950,"In order to further investigate the topologies of the membranes, AFM measurements were carried out to detect the surface roughness. The AFM images of the NFMs and the substrates were shown in Fig. 4 and the calculated mean roughness (Ra) and root mean square roughness (RMS) were listed in Table 1. Both the SEM and AFM measurements clearly revealed that the surface roughness of the prepared NFMs changed in the following sequence: NM@UF10K  NM@UF20K < NM@UF50K, indicating surface roughness of the substrates yielded great effect on the final surface roughness of the dense layer. These results suggested that the SPSF nanoparticles could aggregate more exquisitely on the PES UF substrate with a smoother surface.",114
951,"Surface charges play an important role in a nanofiltration process according to the Donnan effect for rejecting charged solutes [28,29]. The surface zeta potentials of the prepared NFMs were measured and shown in Fig. 6. All the surfaces of NFMs were highly negatively charged over a wide pH range, which was attributed to the high content of the sulfonic groups in SPSF. As to the case of the observed absolute value of negative potential increasing in the following order: NM@UF50K < NM@UF20K < NM@UF10K, it was reasonably related these results to the diffuse double layer theory for surface zeta potential characterization [30,31]. When the membrane surface became rougher, it would lead to the more vigorous disturbance on the diffuse double layer. Thus, the effective stern layer might became thinner and the measured zeta potential would include less negatively charge in the diffuse layer. Finally, negative potential with a lower absolute value was obtained for the rougher surface.",157
952,"The water contact angle measurement was used to characterize the wettability of the UF substrates and NFMs. All the membranes show the similar tendency in water wettability after coating the SPSF nanoparticles. As a representative, the results of NM@UF10K and PES-10K are shown in Fig. S4. The prepared NM@UF10K owned a water contact angle about 57.5deg, which was obviously smaller than the pristine PES-10K membrane (about 73.3deg). The increased water wettability of the NFM was generated from the sulfonic group on the membrane surface. The results indicated the NFM owned the better water wettability than the pristine UF membrane.",99
953,"As for different NFMs, due to the smallest PDCO, NM@UF10K possessed the highest rejections for the four salts. The rejection rate for Na2SO4 reached as high as 94%. With larger PDCOs, the rejection of Na2SO4 of NM@UF20K and NM@UF50K decreased to 85% and 68%, respectively. The water flux increased in the following sequence: NM@UF10K < NM@UF20K < NM@UF50K, from 7.2 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 to 16.8 L m-2 h-1 bar-1. Due to the similar thickness of the dense layers, the increased water flux of each NFM was attributed to the increase of pore size in the corresponding SPSF layer. Compared to the reported researches (shown in Table S1), for example, NM@UF10K exhibited a high performance in separation, which could even be comparable with commercial membranes (e.g., NF90, NF270, and NTR-7450), indicating a huge potential for NM@UF10K in practical application.",139
954,"Considering the requirements in practical application, the NCN layer must be strongly adhere to PES UF substrate. To examine the stability of the dense layer, the prepared NM@UF10K was investigated by a backflushing resistance test (using pure water feed at 0.4 MPa). After being backflushed for 10 min, 30 min and 60 min, the samples were used for salt rejection and water permeation measurements (Fig. 8). Clearly, only a very slight decrease of salt rejection was observed after the first backflashing for 10 min, and the longer backflashing time at 0.4 MPa yield undetectable effect on membrane performance. These results intrinsically attributed to the very strong inter-layer adhesion between the NCN layer and PES UF substrate. The stability of SPSF layer endows the corresponding NFM with good performance reliability.",129
955,"In summary, novel NFMs are fabricated via a facile coating-heating route of SPSF nanoparticles onto PES substrates with different MWCOs. Uniform, dense and negatively charged selective layers are successfully formed by using the aqueous SPSF nanoparticles. The substrate with a smoother surface can obtain a denser and more negatively charged selective layer, which has a positive effect on the rejection for multivalent anions. Finally, the constructed membranes exhibit an excellent separation performance with the water flux of 7.2 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 and the rejection rate for Na2SO4 of 94%, which demonstrates a novel path towards NFMs with an economic and effective process.",103

After purging with nitrogen for 3 h at 0 degC, DCC (1.92 mmol), which was dispersed in a small amount of DCM, was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. Then, the reaction mixture was raised to room temperature and started reaction for 72 h under stirring. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst DMAP and the dicyclohexylurea (from DCC), and concentrated by the rotary evaporation. Then, the mixture was precipitated into methanol and filtered. Further, the obtained polymer was dissolved in DCM and re-precipitated to methanol for three times. After filtration, the polymer was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 degC for 24 h to obtain the DDMAT-terminated polysulfone (DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT), and used as the macromolecular chain transfer agent.",158

After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, it was precipitated into deionized water. The filtered polymer was re-dissolved to DMAc and re-precipitated into deionized water for twice. Finally, the polymer was washed with methanol, and then dried at 60 degC for 24 h to obtain the amphiphilic triblock copolymer poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-polysulfone-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP-PSF-P4VP) according to the mole ratio of [AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:2000.

963,"P4VP-PSF-P4VP/PSF blend membranes were prepared via the SNIPS process, and the schematic illustration for SNIPS process and the surface-segregation of P4VP-PSF-P4VP are shown in Scheme 1. The hydrophilic segment P4VP was segregated gradually towards the membrane surface and pore walls due to the interaction between water and the hydrophilic segment as the contact time increased in the coagulation bath. At the same time, the P4VP-PSF-PSF self-assembled in the bulk and the solvent. According to the ratio set in the Table 2, the casting solutions were prepared by blending polysulfone and P4VP-PSF-P4VP, which were dissolved in DMAc under mechanical stirring at room temperature for 24 h. In order to remove the bubbles, the casting solutions were stood at room temperature for 24 h until the bubbles were exhausted. All casting solutions were cast uniformly in a clean glass plate by a cast knife with a knife gap of 250 mm, and then immediately immersed into the deionized water at room temperature.

964,"The actual electroplating wastewater was received from an electroplating plant, and it came from the rinsing workshop which followed the palladium-nickel alloy electroplating workshop. Its main components are as follows: palladium 19.1 +- 0.53 mg/L, nickel 21.4 +- 1.08 mg/L, sodium 80.2 +- 3.04 mg/L, potassium 16.4 +- 0.68 mg/L, magnesium 6.51 +- 0.25 mg/L, calcium 15.3 +- 0.70 mg/L, chloride 92.6 +- 3.79 mg/L, sulfate 3.59 +- 0.18 mg/L and nitrate 17.6 +- 0.88 mg/L. The pH value of this wastewater (pH 4.1) was adjusted to 2 prior to this membrane filtration experiment. The filtration parameters are as follows: M6 membrane area 38.5 cm2, temperature 25 degC, pH 2, flow rate of the permeate fluid 3 mL/min, and filtration time 50 min.",123
965,"The P4VP-PSF-P4VP was synthesized by the RAFT polymerization as previously stated in the experimental section according to Scheme 2. The HO-PSF-OH was firstly synthesized from DCDPS and BPA via nucleophilic aromatic sulfone substitution, and it is a useful telechelic polymer which can be expediently modified with designed agents via hydroxyl esterification. Thus, DDMAT can be used as a RAFT agent to synthesize the desired macromolecular chain transfer agent DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT by esterification reaction. After that, the RAFT polymerization was carried out with three ratios of [AIBN]:[DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT]:[4-VP] = 1:5:500/1000/2000 to synthesize three P4VP-PSF-P4VPs (BCP1, BCP2 and BCP3, respectively).",96
966,"Furthermore, FTIR spectra of HO-PSF-OH (a) and P4VP-PSF-P4VP (b) are show in Fig. 2. In line (a), the broad adsorption peak at 3448 cm-1 belongs to terminal hydroxyl groups, the peaks at 1295, 1150 and 1078 cm-1 are assigned to the -S = O stretch of sulfone groups, and the peaks at 1585 and 1488 cm-1 are contributed to the aromatic CC stretch (Camacho-Zuniga et al., 2009). In line (b), the FTIR spectrum of P4VP-PSF-P4VP reveals a few new peaks: the peak at 1735 cm-1 derived from CO of ester groups, the peaks at 1413 and 1487 cm-1 assigned to CC stretch of pyridine ring, and the peak at 1592 cm-1 for CN stretch of pyridine ring (Ma et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2014). All results confirm the successful synthesis of P4VP-PSF-P4VP.",133
967,"The thermogravimetric analysis curves of HO-PSF-OH, DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT and P4VP-PS-P4VP are presented in Fig. 3. The curves of HO-PSF-OH and DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT are close, which have a rapid weight loss at about 500 degC, except that DDMAT-PSF-DDMAT has a slight weight loss from 200 degC to 350 degC, which is maybe due to the fracture of CS bond in DDMAT (Ponnusamy et al., 2013). P4VP-PSF-P4VP has a thermal decomposition process with distinct three steps. The first step with a small weight loss begins at about 180 degC, corresponding to the cleave of 4-VP side chains. The second step with a major weight loss occurs at about 350 degC owing to the thermal decomposition of P4VP. The third step with a major weight loss appears at about 450 degC, which is due to the thermal decomposition of the PSF backbone (Zhai et al., 2002).",141
968,"The thickness and bulk porosity of the prepared membranes are displayed in Table 3. The results indicate that the thickness of the membranes has a significant change, depending on the different casting solution compositions. At the same BCP, the membrane thickness reduces with increasing the P4VP-PSF-P4VP percentage. This is because the increase of the amphiphilic copolymer content may delay the rate of phase inversion as described above, resulting in a thinner membrane (Liu et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2019b). Moreover, the thicknesses of dense layer of M0-M7 are about 0.67 +- 0.034, 1.25 +- 0.063, 1.02 +- 0.065, 3.08 +- 0.15, 2.85 +- 0.14, 0.82 +- 0.041, 55.8 +- 2.79 and 12.2 +- 0.61 mm, respectively, which were determined from the SEM images. Additionally, compared with M1-M5, M6 and M7 have lower bulk porosities. The change of membrane bulk porosity is consistent with the results observed by SEM images.",150
969,"The top surface morphologies of all membranes were further characterized by AFM analysis. The three-dimensional AFM images are presented in Fig. 6 with 5 mm x 5 mm scanning area, and the roughness parameters of all membranes obtained with the AFM analysis software are given in Table 4. As shown in Fig. 6, the pristine PSF membrane (M0) possesses a relatively dense top surface with small pore, while the P4VP-PSF-P4VP /PSF blend membranes (M1-M7) show a rougher surface including bumps and undulations. It can also be seen from these images that the membrane surface becomes rougher with the increase of P4VP-PSF-P4VP percentage at the same BCP. With increasing the content of the amphiphilic block copolymer in casting solution, more P4VP hydrophilic segments are expected to self-segregate at the top of the membrane, thereby facilitate a higher degree of surface roughness (Liu et al., 2015). This explains why the membranes with higher content of the amphiphilic block copolymer have rougher surface. The root mean square roughness and average roughness of the membranes are summarized in Table 4, which further support the conclusion obtained above.",183
970,"Adsorption capacity is one of the key factors affecting the separation ability of membrane (Zeng et al., 2017b). According to the previous discussion, three membranes (M1, M3 and M6) under the same BCP content of 70% were selected for comparison of separation performance. The rejection rates of blend membranes toward Pd (II) ions are show in Fig. 11(a) by using a single Pd (II) solution as the feed during filtration process. It is clearly that M6 has a best separation performance compared with M1 and M3. The rejection rate of M6 keeps a very high value before 55 min, and then begins to decline sharply, ultimately approaches 0% at 90 min. The rejection rates of M1 and M3 decrease to about 0% at 45 min and 65 min, respectively. M6 has an excellent rejection performance towards Pd (II) ions. It possible attributes to more adsorption sites in BCP3 with longer P4VP segments, which facilitates the binding and separation of Pd (II) during the filtration process (Chen et al., 2017). Moreover, M6 has a top dense surface structure followed by sponge-like structure (see Fig. 5), which can provide excellent interception ability for Pd (II).",193
971,"Fig. 11(b) shows the effect of permeate volume on Pd (II) concentration in the permeate solution by using M6 at flow rates of 1, 3 and 12 mL/min. M6 has sharp breakthrough curves at all flow rates. This phenomenon is due to the following reasons: When filtering the feed containing Pd (II), the negatively charged Pd (II) species such as [PdCl4]2- anions directly contact with the protonated N atoms of 4-vinylpyridine which are revealed on the membrane surface and pore walls, resulting in an effective Pd (II) adsorption by the electrostatic interaction (Zeng et al., 2019b). After the membrane is saturated with Pd (II), free Pd (II) ions in the feed pass through the membrane, which leading to the sharp increase of Pd (II) concentration in the permeate. Furthermore, when the flow rate increases from 1 to 12 mL/min, the breakthrough curve hardly varies, i.e., the breakthrough curve is independent of the flow rate over this range. Thus, neither binding kinetics nor diffusion limits the adsorption of Pd (II) onto the membrane at these flow rates (Anuraj et al., 2012).",180
972,"Multiple metal ions always are present in industrial wastewaters, and it is important to separate a special metal ion from wastewaters that contain various metal ions. In order to investigate the ability of the membrane to selectively separate Pd (II), Cu (II) and Ni (II) ions were chose as the mixed metal ions. Fig. 13 shows the rejection rates of Pd (II), Cu (II) and Ni (II) ions from the ternary mixed solution by M6 at the filtration time of 90 min. The rejection rates of Cu(II) and Ni(II) ions decrease sharply with the increase of time, and reach rapidly to 0%. This suggests that M6 does not significantly adsorb Cu (II) and Ni (II) during the filtration process, and exhibits low adsorption ability and high permeation performance for these two ions. However, it shows strong retention ability towards Pd (II). The rejection rate for Pd (II) does not reduce until 50 min, and then drops to about 0% at 90 min, which is only slightly decreased compared with the results from the above single-component Pd (II) solution (see Fig. 11(a)). Thus, the presence of Cu (II) and Ni (II) ions insignificantly affect the separation of Pd (II).",198
973,"Generally, the discharge amount of the wastewater is about 17 m3/h from the rinsing workshop of the plant. Considering the fluctuations in production, we calculate the membrane area by using the discharge amount of 20 m3/h. According to the above results, M6 with an effective area of 38.5 cm2 can treat approximately 150 mL of the rinsing wastewater for 50 min with a palladium rejection rate of 96.8 +- 2.71%, corresponding to the palladium adsorption ability of 718.8 +- 20.1 mg/m2 and the membrane flux of 46.8 +- 1.42 L m-2 h-1. Thus, about 530 m2 of the membrane area would meet the treatment requirement of 20 m3/h. If hollow fiber membrane modules (F225 x 1757 mm, with about 55 m2 membrane area/each) of M6 were employed, only ten modules should be needed. After the adsorption reached saturation, palladium could be easily eluted from the filter membrane and further recovered. Thus, the membrane has potential to be used for Pd (II) separation from the actual electroplating rinsing wastewater.",168

975,"Therefore, this research aimed to develop a ""greener"" PSf membranes by using DMSO as alternative solvent in the presence of eco-friendly natural additive GA without having to compromise the performance of the membrane. To the best of our knowledge, there were no similar approaches observed in the literatures and such contribution is worthy to be investigated. The membranes were fabricated via non-induced precipitation (NIPS) and characterized in terms of pore size, porosity, surface wettability and performance measurements in the forms of flux, rejection and flux recovery ratio.",87

Membrane performance testing was evaluated using Congo red (CR) dye which was supplied by from Sigma Aldrich. All the materials and chemicals used were analytical grade.",71
977,"The membrane dope solutions were prepared according to the Table 1. First, polymeric solution was prepared by dissolving 18 wt% of PSf polymer with various green solvents namely TEP, DMSO, cyrene and conventional solvent namely NMP as reference membrane. Next, under the consideration of green approaches in terms of energy consumption and stability in homogenous mixing during the preparation of dope solution as well as the appearance of the fabricated membrane, the optimal membrane was selected and proceeded with the addition 1.5 wt% of eco-friendly natural additive GA. The membrane dope solution was dissolved in solvents at 65 degC and subject to low stirring rate to avoid air bubbles formation until it formed homogeneous solution [19].",116
978,"Membranes dope solutions were fabricated using phase inversion method. First, the homogeneous polymeric solution was poured carefully onto glass plate prior to casting process via casting knife. The gap between the casting knife and the glass plate was measured at 0.2 mm which represents the average thickness of the membrane. Next, the casted membrane film on the glass plate was directly immersed into water bath after few seconds of waiting. The formed asymmetric membranes were left in a water bath until complete solidification and afterwards, distilled water was used to wash and store the membranes in container at ambient temperature (25-30 degC) until used [19].",105
979,"The surface hydrophilicity of the membrane is the wettability of the membrane. The angle between the membrane surface and water droplet is called the contact angle, and it was measured with a contact angle meter. A drop shape analysis system goniometer was used, and the results were generated via Surfaceware 8. Firstly, the membrane sample will be divided into small pieces and attached onto glass slide by double-sided tapes. Before starting the test, any remaining moisture on the surface of the membrane sample will be wiped off. Deionized water is dropped slowly on the membrane sample's surface with a micro-syringe. Then, the micrograph of the contact angle was captured, and further evaluations will be carried out [20]. Triplicates data were collected for each membrane to obtain average readings that represent each membrane sample.",133
980,"Porosity of membrane was calculated by gravimetric method which can be defined by the total volume of porous membrane form the pore volume as shown in Equation (1) while pore size of membranes can be determined by Guerout-Elford-Ferry equation as shown in Equation (2).(1)Porosity,e=o1-o2Axtxdw(2)rm=2.9-1.75ex8elQexAxDP",44
981,"The constants in gravimetric method such as o1 represents the weight of the wet membrane in kg, while o2 represents the dried membrane weight also in kg, A is the area of the membrane in m2, t is the thickness in m, and dw is the solvent density which close to water density which typically at 998 kg/m3. As for the constants in Geurout-Elford-Ferry equation, e is the water viscosity (8 x 10-4 Pa.S), Q represents the volume of pure water permeated per unit time (m3/s), and DP represents the operational pressure (Pa).",93
982,"Flux is simply the water flux rate, or the volumetric flow rate of the fluid passing through the membrane. The permeation rate of the membrane was determined by carrying out testing with dead-end filtration system (Sterlitech TM HP4750, USA). The dead-end filtration system was pressurized until water droplets appear at the tip of the dead-end cell and the weight of the water droplets was recorded every 5 min. Prior to water flux testing, each membrane samples were compressed for 30 min or more until a stable flux is obtained. In this study, the flux for the membrane was measured at transmembrane pressure of 4 bar [20]. The measurement of flux rate could be obtained by using Equation (3).(3)F=VAtwhere F is the permeation flux (L/m2.h), V is the permeate volume (L), A is the effective membrane area (m2) which is at 0.00146 m2, and t is time (hour).",147
983,"Filtration tests were conducted by using 20 ppm Congo red (CR) dyes as solutes. The rejection rate for the membranes can be obtained by using Equation (4).(4)R=1-CpCfx100%where Cp will be the concentration of the permeate solution and Cf will be the concentration of the feed solution. The absorbance of the CR was all measured at the wavelength of 495 nm using the UV-visible spectrometer. Readings were taken three times to obtain an average reading. To measure the stability of the membrane, flux recovery ratio was adopted to measure membrane recovery capability. The measurement for flux recovery ratio can be determined using Equation (5).(5)RFi=FiFox100%where Fo is the first water flux, while Fi is water flux after tested with solutes.",118
984,"Surface hydrophilicity of a membrane can be determined by evaluating and analysing the contact angle between the surface of the membrane with distilled water droplet whereby the lower the contact angle measurement, the higher the hydrophilicity of the membrane. Fig. 2 showed the contact angle of each sample of the membrane and the results presented two major observation. The first observation showed that, without the addition of natural additive GA, membrane sample of N1, D1, C1 and T1 all showed higher contact angle measurement with approximately similar contact angle value of 64.50deg, 63.73deg, 64.80deg and 65.7deg respectively. On the other hand, in the presence of eco-friendly natural additive GA, N2 and D2 membrane recorded improvement by 4.40% and 6.81% respectively as compared to unmodified membrane. Such observation proved that; the presence of the eco-friendly natural additive GA can enhance membrane hydrophilicity. The reason for such behaviour was attributed to the amphiphilic properties of GA that consist of hydrophilic functional group. This pattern was also recorded in other available literature studies [17,22].",171
985,"This study investigates the feasibility and compatibility of fabricating membrane sheets with green solvents instead of conventional solvents and at the same time compare the performance of the selected membrane in the presence of GA as eco-friendly natural additive. Results have indicated that green solvent like DMSO can produce membrane sheets with comparable or better characteristics in terms of pore size, porosity, and surface wettability. Generally, for all modified membrane, the addition of eco-friendly natural additive GA played an important role in increasing the formation of pores thus increases the hydrophilicity of the membrane. In addition to that, with the hydrophilicity being enhanced, the performance of water flux and flux recovery will be greatly improved without compromising membrane performance. With that being said, it can be deduced that the addition of GA in membrane preparation is extremely advantageous, the improvement of the said performances will eventually result in a more effective membrane system. Overall, membrane set D2 has the best membrane performance with rejection rate of 84.84%, water flux of 8.63 LMH, and FRR of 93.29%.",176

989,"During the last few decades, freshwater resources were remarkably diminished in several areas of the world [1]. This problem can be expected to aggravate as a result of multiple factors such as population growth, water contamination, climate change, and abuse of water resources, leading to a freshwater scarcity problem [1-3]. The World Water Council (WWC) predicts that, by the end of 2030, 3.9 billion people will strongly suffer from water scarcity, around the world [4]. Therefore, water scarcity is a dormant crisis about to burst worldwide. Consequently, there is an urgent need for developing simple, efficient, and feasible technologies for wastewater remediation.",102
990,"Membrane technologies are preferred over many other technologies for water remediation owing to their unmatched features including economic, selective, mild operating conditions, efficiency, no need for chemical or thermal treatments, reliable purification, and eco-friendship [5]. In the last few decades, membrane technology has developed with the integration of filtration and adsorption processes [6,7]. Membrane-coated adsorbents were effectively applied in water desalination and removal of hazardous pollutants including heavy metal ions, anions, toxic organic compounds, and dyes from wastewater [8-10].",79
991,"The excellent thermal and chemical stability, superior mechanical properties, and good film-forming characteristic of polysulfone (PS) [11-13], have attracted the attention of many membrane-interested researchers. The main drawbacks of PS membranes are the inherent hydrophobicity and non-wetting properties which facilitate the hydrophobic interaction and deposition of microorganisms and/or organic pollutants from the feed solution onto their surfaces, causing serious membrane biofouling [13-15], and consequently, poor permeation, diminishing water flux, and defects in the selectivity and durability of membrane. Both physical and chemical modifications can be applied to overcome these disadvantages. Using polymeric additives, dendrimers, inorganic fillers, inorganic nanoparticles, and carbon nanomaterials during PS membrane fabrication, has been attracted a significant attention to enhance its hydrophilicity, antifouling properties, and performance [13,16,17].",120
992,"Consequently, incorporation of polymeric additives (poly(ionic liquid) chitosan Schiff bases (PILCSBs)) into the matrix of polysulfone (PS) membrane could provide an opportunity to design mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) with improved hydrophilicity and better performance in terms of permeability, porosity, and rejection ability.

Initially, each MMM was compacted at a trans-membrane-pressure (TMP) of 0.1 MPa for 30 min. Then, the pressure on the membrane was raised to 0.3 MPa followed by filtration of pure water through the membrane. After 90 min of water flow, a steady-state water flux (Jw1) was calculated. Afterward, the pure water was replaced by an aqueous BSA solution (0.8 g/L), and the BSA flux (JBSA) after 90 min flow was calculated.

1010,"FTIR technique offers preliminary spectral evidence for the successful conversion of LMWC into PICCSBs. Comparing the FTIR spectra of the PICCSBs with the LMWC spectrum (Fig. 1A) revealed the retention of the main peaks that are characteristic for the LMWC backbone (3440 cm-1, O-H and N-H; 1650 cm-1, amide I C=O; 890 cm-1, glycosidic bond) [26,37], in the spectra of PICCSBs; confirming sustain the LMWC skeleton even after its surface modification.",71

In addition, the observation of three predominant peaks (1520 cm-1, C=N; 749 cm-1, Py ring; and 556 cm-1, Het-N+Cl-), distinctive for the pyridinium-ammonium ionic liquid terminal [26], confirm the spreading of ionic liquid compartments on the surface of poly(ionic) cross-linked chitosan Schiff bases (PICCSBs).",103
1012,"The SEM micrographs (Fig. S4, ESI+) were used to investigate the changes in the surface morphologies of PICCSBs in comparison to that of the native LMWC. As evident in Fig. S3, there are significant differences between the surface morphologies of PICCSBs and LMWCS. LMWCS displays a dense, smooth, and flat surface, while; PICCSBs show woven-like or sponge-like surfaces. This may be ascribed to the formation of additional hydrophilic (ionic charges, phenolic, and imine linkages) and hydrophobic sites (benzene rings) on the surfaces of PICCSBs that enhanced the interactions between LMWC chains in PICCSBs through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions resulting in the formation of surfaces with cross-sectional pores and micro-void network.",110
1013,"Comparing the ATR-FTIR spectra of the as-fabricated MMMs (MMM1,2) with that of native PS membrane (M0) (Fig. 1B) offers preliminary evidence for the incorporation of PICCSBs into the matrix of polysulfone, confirming the successful fabrication of MMMs. To name few, as compared to the spectrum of M0, it is noticed that new spectral peaks were observed in the spectra of MMMs around 3450, 1660, 1579, 1281, and 858 cm-1 which can assignable for the vibrations of N-H and O-H, azomethine (H-C=N), C=N, Ar-O, and R4N+Cl- that belong to the chitosan, salicylidene, and ionic liquid segments of PICCSBs [30,31]. Moreover, the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration peaks of the O=S=O, that distinctive for PS backbone, were observed at ca 1295 and 1149 cm-1, confirming the reserving of the structural features of PS after its surface modification with PICCSBs.",137

The obtained results were represented as element mapping images (Fig. 3G,H) and EDX spectra (Figs. S6-S9, ESI+). The EDX element mapping results demonstrated the distribution of PICCSBs on the surface of PS. As the carbon, oxygen, and sulfur elements already exist in the PS surface, the element mapping of nitrogen and chlorine elements (from PICCSBs) was chosen to distinguish between the native PS membrane and MMMs. As shown in (Fig. 3G,H) and (Fig. S5), the nitrogen and chlorine elements can be detected only on the surface of MMMs.",101
1015,"As the performance of any membrane is strongly correlated with the pore size distribution (PSD) on the internal and external surfaces of the membrane, therefore, the PSD of new MMMs was investigated using A QUANTACHROME POREMASTER 60-GT, as shown in Fig. 4C. As evident in this figure and in Fig. S4, ESI+, both membranes (MMM1,2) exhibited many channels and pores. The surface of each membrane shows many channels with internal diameters in the ranges of 4.5-6.8 mm (MMM1) and 5.6-8.5 mm (MMM2). On the other hand, the core of each membrane involves many spherical and polygonal pores with a hierarchical pore size distribution ranging from small internal pores with PD values (MMM1, 0.7-1.3; MMM2, 1.3-3.7 mm) to large internal pores with PD values (MMM1, 57.5-77.4; MMM2, 76.3-104.5 mm).",128
1016,"The ion-exchange capacity (IEC) is a crucial feature for assessing the selectivity of membranes. Therefore, three different techniques were applied to determine the IEC of the nascent PS membrane (M0) and the new MMMs towards the nitrate anion (mimic to denitrification process); namely, elemental analysis (EA) (N%) and indirect titration or spectrophotometric determination of the NO3- anion as represented in Fig. 5B. In general, blending of PICCSBs into PS membrane has greatly improved its anion-exchange capacity owing to spreading of active cationic sites (ammonium and pyridinium) on the surface of MMMs.",91
1017,"The theoretical (virtual) IEC values were calculated from the EA results using Eq. (4) [45];(4)IEC=10XNMNmmolg-1where, XN and MN represent the weight fraction of nitrogen (%) in the membrane, after NO3- uptake, and its molar mass (g mol-1), respectively. Based on N% in each membrane and Eq. (4), the IEC values of membranes M0, MMM1, and MMM2 were 0.64 +- 0.09, 2.33 +- 0.13, and 1.98 +- 0.11, respectively. However, the IEC calculated for the MMMs from EA are 6% +- 1% lower than that measured spectrophotometrically, whereas, they are 15% +- 2% lower than that obtained by titration. This discrepancy mainly arises from the existence of free basic amino groups, due to PICCSBs blending, in the network of membranes [45]. These amine groups would surely affect the titration and spectrophotometric determination of the nitrate anion.",135
1018,"Generally, the different methods used for IEC determination show that the nitrate-exchange capacity of the PICCSB1-incorporated membrane (MMM1) is ~14% higher than that of the PICCSB2-supported membrane (MMM2). This preferable nitrate-uptake by MMM1 could be attributed to the higher population of active cationic moieties (anion-selective groups) on its surface in comparison to MMM2; as revealed from the elevated values of N% content, DC%, and positive surface charge (z-potential) for MMM1 (cf. Table 2, Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the nitrate-exchange capacity for our new membrane (MMM1) was 3.4-times higher than that reported for the most efficient quaternary ammonium polysulfone (QAPS) membrane [46] and 1.3-folds higher than that for the UF microreactor (MMR) [47].",111
1019,"This amazing water permeation performance could be ascribed to the greatly enhanced surface hydrophilicity and porosity of PS owing to PICCSBs blending. Moreover, these hydrophilic additives (PICCSBs) will also enhance the interaction between the hydrophilic pores and pure water within the porous framework of MMMs; resulting in improved water mass transfer across them. Contrary, PICCSBs will diminish the hydrophobicity of membranes resulting in reducing their propensity to adsorb the organic contaminants (BSA) [46].",73
1020,"As aforesaid, that the FRR is a key parameter in predicting the membrane fouling resistance, moreover, the results of fouling indices (total (Ft), reversible (Fr), and irreversible (Fir) fouling) are important in providing more detail concerning the fouling propensity and mechanism. In general, the FRR results (Fig. 7) proved that the incorporation of PICCSBs into PS matrix has remarkably improved its antifouling performance. The values of FRR for the bare, PICCSB1-, and PICCSB2-supported PS membranes (M0, MMM1, MMM2) were 39.1, 91.9, and 87.1%, respectively; indicating the superior fouling impedance of the PICCSBs-blended membranes. Interestingly, the trend of FRR changes is in accordance with the results of WCA and PWF of the as-fabricated MMMs. The excellent fouling resistance of MMMs can be ascribed to the adsorption of water molecules over the hydrophilic surface of the membrane to form a thin hydration layer of water molecules upon the outer membrane surface that blocks the adsorption of organic foulants [48].",157
1021,"Eventually, it would be interesting to compare our results with those previously reported in the literature as depicted in Table 3 [32,49-51]. Our membranes (MMM1 and MMM1) were more hydrophilic, as revealed from elevation of water contact angle (WCA) values, and consequently have greater water uptake (WU) than most reported PSF-based membranes. This in turn leads to higher pure water throughput along with low fouling propensity [31]. Where, MMM1 displayed very high pure water permeability, in comparison to other MMMs, as revealed from the elevated PWF values.",87
1022,"In addition, the decreasing in fouling indices, such as diminished BSA-rejection values coupled with higher flux recovery ratio (FRR), is indicative for the extremely low fouling propensity of our as-fabricated membranes, as compared to the reported ones. In general, the new fabricated membranes in this work could be ranked in the forefront of PSF-based membranes in comparison to the earlier reported ones, and may offer promising ultrafiltration membranes for nitrate-polluted water remediation.",72

1034,"Water treatment membranes are thin sheets of material that can be used to separate particles from water based on size exclusion, charge or aromaticity [1-3]. Nonsolvent phase induced separation (NIPS) is a common method for casting of polymeric membranes. In NIPS, polymer materials are first dissolved in a solvent/co-solvent mixture to produce a dope solution, which is then cast on a substrate as a liquid film. The liquid film is then immersed into a nonsolvent, often water, for phase inversion. During the phase inversion process, the solvents diffuse into water, and the polymer remains on the substrate as a membrane matrix [4,5].",102
1035,"As more applications are found for membranes, the environmental impacts of membrane production become more important to investigate. One associated concern is with respect to the solvents used to dissolve the polymers [6-8]. Commonly used solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), are generally toxic to humans and the environment [5,9], and regulations restricting their use during mass production are starting to appear. The European Legislation, Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) has labeled DMF, DMAc and NMP as substances of very high concern (SVHC), and it bans the use of DMAc and NMP after May 2020 [10,11]. Therefore, the need to find less hazardous alternatives for these solvents is imperative. Rhodiasolv(r) PolarClean (PC) and g-valerolactone (GVL) are two solvents being researched because of their low levels of toxicity [4,9].",135
1036,"Wang et al. [12] prepared polyethersulfone (PES), polysulfone (PSf), and cellulose acetate (CA) membranes using PolarClean as the solvent which compare with membranes fabricated by traditional solvents. With PolarClean as the solvent, PES and PSf membranes formed surface pores suitable for ultrafiltration (UF), while CA membranes formed pores acceptable for nanofiltration (NF) [12]. The performance of these membranes was comparable to membranes created using traditional solvents. Marino et al. [13] similarly worked with PolarClean in the fabrication of PES membranes. They found the microstructure of the membranes to be spongy, and that they performed well in permeability tests compared to membranes prepared with traditional solvents. In addition to PolarClean, GVL is another eco-friendly solvent, and it is produced from biomass as a derivative of glucose [14,15]. Rasool et al. [16] prepared membranes using GVL and a variety of different polymers, most notably CA and cellulose triacetate (CTA). Specifically, 15% CA/GVL and 10% CTA/GVL dopes were used to cast nanofiltration (NF) that rejected 90% Rhodamine B, at permeances of 1.8 Lm-2h-1bar-1 (LMH/bar) and 11.7 LMH/bar, respectively.",175
1037,"PolarClean and GVL have been previously used to dissolve PSf to fabricate ultrafiltration membranes both as sole solvents and as co-solvents. When PolarClean was used as a solvent, it produced membranes with spongy-like pore structures that were different from finger-like structures observed when DMAc was used to cast PSf membranes [17]. Furthermore, the PSf/PolarClean pore structure was observed to collapse upon backwashing. Conversely, GVL alone was found not to be suitable to fabricate PSf membranes because the dope formed gel-like films instead of solid films during NIPS with water as the nonsolvent [9]. Under equal amounts of PolarClean and GVL as a co-solvent mixture, it was observed that membranes had similar structural, morphological and operational properties compared to membranes made using DMAc [4].",123
1038,"At the laboratory scale, a doctor blade is a common tool to solution casting membranes; however, it is not scalable [18,19]. In order to investigate the scale up abilities of the membranes cast using green solvent, slot die casting is introduced for this study, and used in combination with a roll-to-roll (R2R) system, which allows for continuous casting of polymeric membranes [20]. An illustration of this system is shown in Fig. 1.",72
1039,"Specifically, in this process, two die halves are set apart by a small gap (W) with a shim, and the fluid is pumped into the die at a chosen flow rate; then, the fluid is continuously cast onto a moving substrate. A zoomed in view of the casting region of the slot die coating process is shown in Fig. 2. In this slot die process, the controlled casting thickness (h) is a function of the flow rate of solution per unit width (Q') and substrate speed (uw) [21], which is h = Q'/uw. Though to a lesser degree, the slot gap in the slot die (W) and the gap height (H) can also affect the quality of the films cast. In order to fabricate defect-free membranes, values of Q', uw and H must be determined.",135
1040,"In this study, eco-friendly solvents, PolarClean and GVL, were investigated to dissolve PSf into dope solutions used to cast ultrafiltration membranes at the laboratory scale using a doctor blade and at the production scale using a slot die casting integrated into a R2R system. Since different fabrication techniques may result in membrane with different properties [22,23], the membranes were characterized with respect to their chemical and morphological structures, and were used to filter different solutions for comparison. It is important to note that in the procedure described here, the membranes were cast directly onto a glass plate using both methods, doctor blade extrusion and slot die coating. However, typically large-scale production membranes are cast onto a nonwoven fabric. A glass plate was used here instead of nonwoven fabric to minimize structural and operational interactions between the dope and the substrate from one processing method to another, so that the effects of scalability could be more comparably accessed.",157
1041,"PSf (flakes, ground material for Ultrason E. 6020P Q691) provided by BASF Performance Materials (Wyandotte, Michigan, United States) is used as the polymer. Three solvents are used to dissolve the polymer, (1) GVL, purchased from Acros Organics (Fair Lawn, New Jersey, United States); (2) Rhodiasolv(r) PolarClean provided by Solvay Novecare (Princeton, New Jersey, United States); and (3) DMAc purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). To study the filtration performance of the membranes, Grade I deionized (DI) water with a resistivity of 18.2 mO cm at 25 degC provided by the Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Laboratory at University of Kentucky, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) purchased from VWR Life Science (Radnor, PA, USA), are used.",116
1042,"The affinity of a polymer and a solvent is described as Ra was calculated by Hansen Solubility Parameter (HSP) theory, as equation (1):(1)Ra=4(dd2-dd1)2+(dp2-dp1)2+(dh2-dh1)2Where dd is the dispersive force, dpis the polar force, and dh is hydrogen bonding [24]. A solvent is considered as a good solvent for a polymer when the value of Ra is small [16,24].",57
1043,"In this study, PSf was not only dissolved using single solvents, but also a binary solvent mixture. Therefore, the corresponding parameters of the binary solvent mixture were calculated according to following procedure: first, the volume fraction of each solvent was calculated by equations (2) and (3); second, the values of solubility parameters were then calculated using equation (4) and (5), and 6 [24]:(2)V1=W1/r1W1/r1+W2/r2(3)V2=W2/r2W1/r1+W2/r2(4)dd=V1dd1+V2dd2(5)dp=V1dp1+V2dp2(6)dh=V1dh1+V2dh2Where 1, 2 represents solvent 1 and solvent 2; Vi represents the volume fraction, and Wi represents the weight fraction.",82
1044,"Three parameters of a polymer or solvent can be used to form a polymer-solvent affinity sphere [24] in HSP theory, and the relative energy difference (RED) is then introduced to describe the interaction between a polymer and a solvent [25].

1045,"In order to determine the compatibility of a solvent to fabricate membranes by the nonsolvent phase inversion method, a cloud point curve must be obtained for solvent/nonsolvent/polymer trinary system [5,26]. For the solvent/water/PSf system, a cloud point curve is experimentally determined by titration [5,27,28]. During the experiments, dope solutions are prepared using 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 wt % concentrations of PSf in DMAc, PolarClean, GVL and the mixture of 50% PolarClean with 50% GVL. Each dope solution is mixed using a sonicator (Elmasonic P70H, from Elma Electronic Inc., Munich, Germany) at 65 degC (with frequency of 80 kHz, power of 900 W under pulse mode) for 24 h. All dope solutions are then cooled to room temperature, and DI water is gradually added into the dope solutions using a micropipette until the solutions visually became cloudy. The cloudy solution is then sonicated for one additional hour to determine if it returns to a clear state. If the solution remains cloudy, the composition of solvent/water/polymer is determined to be the cloud point.",174
1046,"Three different PSf dope solutions are used in this study, 17 wt% PSf/DMAc, 17 wt% PSf/PolarClean, and 17 wt% PSf/50 wt% PolarClean-50 wt% GVL. These three dope solutions were chosen based on results from previous studies [4,9,17]. Since the purpose of this study is to investigate the scaled fabrication of membranes using slot die as compared to a laboratory doctor blade, all the dope solutions are prepared in large quantities, i.e., liters. Therefore, a kinetic study of polymer dissolution in different solvents is conducted after preparation.",86
1047,"The polymer dissolution is studied in a high-pressure reactor (4540-600 mL, Parr Instrument, Moline, Illinois, United States). The reactor is equipped with a four-blade impeller. The dissolution process is conducted in a glass vessel under different rotation speeds of 300, 450, 600 rpm (revolutions per minute), separately. For each trial, 200 mL of solvent (DMAc, PolarClean, and the mixture of PolarClean and GVL with equal weight percent) is used and PSf flakes are mixed in the solvent, and time required for complete dissolution is measured. The flake form of PSf can minimize the influence of shape and size on the mixing process because compared to the common commercially available pellet form, the flake is thin and therefore provides more surface area to interact with the solvent.",126
1048,"Polymer dissolution is conducted in a transparent vessel so that it be visually monitored; moreover, viscosity is used as a quantitative indicator to monitor dope solution mixing until completion, and is measured as a homogenous solution [4]. After homogenous dope solutions are obtained, the viscosity of each solution sample is measured using a rheometer (AG-G2, TA instrument, Delaware, United States). Dope solution viscosity as a function of changing shear rate is used to demonstrate the fluid behavior of these solutions to determine if they can be cast using a doctor blade or slot die. The viscosity of each sample is recorded over the change of shear rate from 0.01 to 100/s.",111
1049,"The diffusion rate is measured in a cuvette cell, is then positioned in VWR UV-6300PC spectrophotometer (Radnor, Pennsylvania, United States) [29]. 20 mL DI water is circulated in the spectrophotometer and the blank calibration is obtained. Then 1 mL dope solution is dropped into DI water and the light transmittance at 276 nm is recorded over 5 min. The light transmittance data is then normalized and compared among dope solutions of PSf/DMAc, PSf/PolarClean and PSf/50% PolarClean-50% GVL.",77
1050,"The glass substrates are cleaned with DI water and are then rinsed using isopropyl alcohol to guarantee no residual water on the surface before casting. After casting, the liquid films are inversed into a solid film via the NIPS method. Membranes pieces are then cast in the shape of 305 x 100 mm x mm (length x width).",58

A piece of each membrane sample is freeze-dried overnight to minimize the moisture in the membrane and is then placed on the ATR-FTIR crystal (diamond) for analysis. The absorbance spectra of these six different membranes are normalized [31-34] and are then adjusted in the same figure for comparison.",84
1053,"Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the surface and cross sections can directly provide the morphology difference of the membranes fabricated using different solvents and methods. The surfaces and the cross sections of the six different PSf membranes are observed by two different SEMs (Hitachi S-4300 from Hitachi Group, Troy, MI, USA and FEI Quanta 250 from Thermo Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA). To prepare membrane samples for SEM imaging, the PSf membranes are immersed and fractured in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried overnight and then sputtered with palladium for 4 min. All the images are presented as a scale bar of 50 mm.",101
1054,"Membrane hydrophilicity represents the water affinity of the material. It affects its water permeability [35]. The contact angle is characterized to represent hydrophilicity of the membranes. It is measured by the sessile drop method using a drop shape analyzer connected to a high-definition camera (DSA 100S, Kruss Company, Hamburg, Germany). One drop 12 mL of DI water is deposited on the membrane surface. The interface between the water drop and the membrane surface is recorded by the camera and the contact angle is calculated according to the image. For each membrane sample, the water contact angle is recorded after 5 min. The measurement is repeated three times and then the average values and deviations are calculated.",116
1055,"The topography of membranes is measured at the atomic scale to characterize the roughness on the surface. Surface roughness provides quantitative information to investigate the influence of different factors shaping the topography of the membrane surface, for instance, solvent evaporation, solvent-nonsolvent diffusion rate, etc. The surface roughness values of the six membranes (M1-M6) are measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Quesant Instrument Co., Agoura Hills, California, United States). The surface roughness is measured under the tapping mode and is then evaluated by root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness. Six areas of 20 x 20 mm on each membrane surface are randomly chosen and measured to calculate the average and standard deviation of the RMS roughness values.",114
1056,"Using the Hansen solubility parameter model, RED values were calculated and are shown in Table 2 to verify whether it was thermodynamically possible to use the eco-friendly solvents to dissolve PSf. As previously discussed, RED values are used as indicators to identify good solvents as defined by RED values between the polymer and solvent being close to or smaller than 1. Therefore, based on the calculated results of RED values, PolarClean, GVL, DMAc and the solvent mixture of 50% PolarClean and 50% GVL can all theoretically dissolve PSf. As shown in Table 2, the RED value of the solvent mixture of PolarClean and GVL was less than those of the individual solvents. This is because the dispersive force of the solvent mixture is closer to PSf than PolarClean, the polar force of the solvent mixture is closer to PSf than GVL, and the hydrogen bonding of the solvent mixture is the same to PSf. Therefore, from equation (1), the RED value of the solvent mixture is less than the two solvents individually, which makes it a potential solvent for PSf.",180
1057,"The cloud point curve has been recognized as an important factor to determine the cross-sectional morphology of a polymeric membranes. More specifically, the curve represents the capacity that a dope solution has to absorb water. With 20% and 25% of PSf in the dope solutions, the capacities of the dope solutions to absorb water are similar. With lower contents of polymers, the curve of PSf/GVL/water was closest to the axis, as shown in Fig. 3, meaning that even a small amount of water could lead to phase separation. This observation agreed with previous studies that GVL might not be an ideal solvent for fabricating PSf membranes [4,9]. The curve of PSf/DMAc/water shows the largest capacity to absorb water, which supports the ability of DMAc to dissolve PSf polymer. PSf/PolarClean/water is in between PSf/GVL/water and PSf/DMAc/water. The curve of PSf/50%PolarClean-50%GVL/water is in between PSf/GVL/water and PSf/PolarClean/water, but with no significant difference between the curves of PSf/50%PolarClean-50%GVL/water and PSf/PolarClean/water. Therefore, thermodynamically, the cross-sectional structures of these two membranes are expected to be similar; however, the diffusion rate of PolarClean and the solvent mixture should also be considered.",185
1058,"During phase separation, the solvent diffuses into the nonsolvent, which is DI water, and the solid polymeric film remains. The diffusion rate from solvent into nonsolvent is a direct factor that influences the microstructure of the membranes. The diffusion into water curves for DMAc and PolarClean pure solvents and of PolarClean/GVL solvent mixture are shown in Fig. 4. DMAc diffused into water at a linear speed until 90% of the DMAc had diffused, which occurred in 180 s. PolarClean gradually diffused into water, and it took approximately 225 s for 90% of PolarClean to diffuse into water. It is hypothesized that the curve representing the solvent mixture of PolarClean/GVL diffusion into water can be discussed in two stages. First, GVL diffuses into water at a faster speed than PolarClean, and 50% of the solvent diffuses into water during the first 30 s. Then, the leftover solvent, mostly PolarClean diffuses into water at a slower speed, and 90% of the solvent diffuses into the water within 150 s. The different diffusion rates between solvents and nonsolvent might lead to different cross-sectional morphologies of membranes.",183
1059,"The viscosity data of the three dope solutions are presented in Fig. 6. In the range of shear rate from 0.01 to 100 s-1, the viscosity did not change significantly, which means the dope solutions showed Newtonian fluid behavior. Though Newtonian fluids are more ideal for fabrication, casting non-Newtonian solutions is more amenable for slot die casting versus doctor blade extrusion. The viscosity of PSf/DMAc and PSf/PolarClean dope solutions are approximately 0.37 Pa s and 13.6 Pa s, respectively. The addition of GVL in the PSf/50%PolarClean-50%GVL decreases the viscosity to approximately 4.6 Pa s.",94
1060,"Six membranes were characterized using FTIR and are shown in Fig. 7. The peaks of the primary microstructures of PSf are listed in Table 3. The spectrum in Fig. 7 shows that the peaks of PSf membranes M1- M6 match the peaks listed in Table 3. Therefore, during the membrane fabrication process, different solvents do not affect the chemistry of membrane surface.",62
1061,"SEM images of surface and microstructure of PSf membranes made using different solvents and different casting methods are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The surface images show that all three dope solutions can be used to fabricate membranes without significant defects on the surface, both using the doctor blade and the slot die techniques. There were likely some impurities on the surface of membranes, but these did not affect the membrane properties.",74
1062,"In Fig. 9, it is shown that the thickness of membranes fabricated using the three recipes, which ranges from 125 to 150 mm. The thickness of the liquid films should have been similar for the different dope solutions. However, considering the wetting property, solvent evaporation, and the demixing process in the nonsolvent bath are different for these three dope solutions, thus the thickness values of formed membranes were not the same.",71
1063,"Furthermore, it is shown in Fig. 9 that the cross-section morphologies of membranes are different based on different fabrication methods and different solvents used. As observed, all six cross-sectional images of membranes are different. Using the traditional solvent DMAc, both M1 and M4, doctor blade and slot die, respectively, show similar cross-sectional structures with finger-like pores close to the active layer, and irregular microvoids in the supportive layer. When PolarClean is used, the membranes show different morphologies under the different casting methods. Using the slot die technique, the membrane exhibits patterned finger-like structures throughout the supportive layer of the membrane; on the other hand, while using the doctor blade, the membrane exhibits sponge-like structures. The solvent mixture of PolarClean and GVL also produced membranes with different morphologies under different casting techniques. Using slot die, M3 shows a unique structure, composed of a dense active layer on top, followed by a layer of finger-like microvoids and a sponge-like supportive layer. Using the doctor blade, M6 shows only a sponge-like structure in the supportive layer.",173
1064,"Considering the demixing process thermodynamically and kinetically, the demixing path of the dope solutions in the nonsolvent bath is the dominant factor to shape the cross-section morphology [36,37]. Specifically, an instantaneous demixing process can form finger-like structures while a delayed demixing process can form sponge-like structures [37]. For the slot die membranes, M1 shows larger microvoids than M2 and M3 in the cross-section structures, while for the doctor blade membranes, M4 also shows finger-like structures while M5 and M6 show spongey-like structures. This might be due that the low viscosity of PSf/DMAc dope solution that caused an instantaneous demixing process in the nonsolvent bath, while the PSf/PolarClean and PSf/50% PolarClean-50%GVL dope solutions had higher viscosity and hence caused a delayed demixing process.",122
1065,"The contact angle values of all six membranes were measured and monitored for 5 min and the results are shown in Fig. 11. At 15 s, the average contact angle values of these membranes were in the range of 60-75deg. Theoretically, with the same membrane material, the contact angle should be in the same range. The contact angle values of M1 and M4 are slightly smaller than M3 and M6, and the values of M1 and M3 are smaller than M4 and M6, indicating that the contact angle might be correlated to the surface roughness, which would be expected. The smoother surfaces might lead to more hydrophobic membrane surfaces when the same membrane material is used. The M2 membrane, the slot die membrane fabricated using PolarClean, is an outlier.",129
1066,"Wettability was evaluated as the contact angle dropped over the time. M2 was the most hydrophobic at the beginning and then the contact angle drastically dropped over 5 min, which also eventually led to the highest wettability. The reason for this might have been the slot die membranes fabricated using PolarClean form a regular finger-like water channel. The contact angle values of other membranes gradually decreased over time; therefore, the wettability of these membranes is similar.",76
1067,"The flux linearity of these six membranes under crossflow filtration is shown in Fig. 12. After 20 h of precompaction, all the membranes were assumed to be fully compacted, and the flux of membranes changed linearly over the pressure applied on the membranes. From Fig. 12, the membranes fabricated using slot die casting and doctor blade extrusion show strong linear correlations between DI water flux and applied pressure. Moreover, all of the membranes show good reproducibility except M5. The DI water permeability of M5 is linear to the applied pressure on the membrane in both trials, but the permeability values are different. It is observed that one of the M5 trials had a slightly lower flux, which might be due to the spongy-like pore structures of this membrane collapsing during precompaction, which affects the water channels of this membranes. It has been reported previously that when pure PolarClean was used to fabricate polymeric membranes, the sponge-like pore structures collapsed during filtration and cleaning process [17,40], and the addition of GVL can increase the stability of the pore structures [40]. It was proved by the filtration data of M3 and M6 in Fig. 12.",193
1068,"The crossflow filtration shows that the membranes cast using the slot die technique perform better or have at least equivalent flux to those cast using the doctor blade. However, it is observed that all the membranes cast using the doctor blade show higher BSA rejections than the slot die membranes, mostly due to the sponge-like support layers in the cross-sectional structures of the membranes, which were discussed previously (Fig. 9).",70

1073,"Membrane-based water treatment has distinct advantages [1-3]. In particular, ultrafiltration (UF) has important applications in various industrial fields [4,5]. Nevertheless, the performance of UF polymeric membranes, commonly made from polysulfone (PSf) [6], polyamide (PA) [7], polyethersulfone (PES) [8] and so on [9-11], is limited by the tradeoff effect between permeability and selectivity [12,13].",53
1074,"Mixed-matrix membrane (MMM), consisting of dispersed inorganic or organic fillers throughout the continuous polymer matrix, is the up-to-date development to overcome the limitations of polymeric membrane while minimizing changes of current manufacturing processes [14-16]. Nanoparticles are typically used as the nanosized inorganic fillers, attributable to the best surface area to volume ratio for yielding large particle/polymer interfacial areas. The high agglomerate tendency of nanoparticles in the casting solution, however, often induces the increase of the particle size, which consequently reduces the specific surface area of the nanosized fillers. More critically, the random particulate aggregates are easy to cause poor contact between the inorganic filler and the polymeric membrane chain, thus partially damaging the final MMM structure [5,15].",117
1075,"Recently, it is reported that two-dimensional (2D) nanosized inorganic fillers present superiority over the zero-dimensional ones in MMMs [2,7,17]. On the one hand, the laminated structure of the 2D fillers favors their dispersion in casting solution, which then facilitates a uniform distribution of the inorganic phase in the polymeric membrane without any additives. On the other hand, the 2D fillers can spontaneously form ""brick-and-mortar"" architecture in the polymer matrix and effectively interfere with the molecular diffusion in the membrane separation process. In the case of porous 2D fillers, the difference in cross-plane and in-plane confinements will further lead to anisotropic molecular diffusivity and affect the permeability and selectivity of the membranes [18]. In this field, 2D nanostructures such as graphene nanoplatelets [19], clay nanosheets [20] and leaf-shaped zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) nanoflakes [21] have been used as fillers for UF, reverse osmosis and/or pervaporation membranes, respectively. It was demonstrated that 2D fillers noticeably outperformed the near-spherical fillers in the nanocomposite membranes.",161
1076,"Among various fabrication methods of incorporating nanosized fillers into a polymer matrix, nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process has been regarded as an effective route [22]. PSf is one of the most common polymers selected to make membranes by the NIPS process due to its commercial availability, ease of processing, together with excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties [6]. The NIPS method is also competent to prepare PSf membranes with an anisotropic Loeb-Sourirajan structure mostly for UF applications [16,23].",79
1077,"Though 2D nanomaterial is highly favored in MMMs, many inorganic materials are difficult to form 2D nanostructures due to their crystal habit. For instance, cuprous iodide (CuI) in our case, adopts a zinc blende structure without intrinsic intention to form 2D nanostructures. Nevertheless, the 2D self-assembly of tiny building blocks provides an alternative to constructing quasi-2D nanostructures in the form of either superlattice or superstructure, depending on the internal degree of order [24-26].",73
1078,"In this research, we successfully transform the commercial CuI powders into self-assembled 2D sheet-like CuI superstructures (s-CuI) based on the above approach. The addition of a small percentage of 2D s-CuI into PSf has significantly improved the membrane performance, by increasing both the water flux and rejection of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The lateral (in-plane) dimension of CuI nanosheets is within micrometer scale, which is normally considered unsuitable to be embedded in the ultra-thin PSf layer. However, our results verify that the s-CuI nanosheets are nicely compatible to the NIPS process, due to their preferential orientation in the hybrid membranes. Our case study provides new perspective in 2D superstructure design by assembling 0D nanoparticles. It enables recruiting more low-cost materials as functional 2D fillers in MMMs, which may broaden the application and reduce the industrial expense of MMMs.",138
1079,"Polysulfone (PSf) with Mw-35000 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with Mw-400 were obtained from Solvay and Aladdin, respectively. N, N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.8%) were purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Company. Cuprous iodide (CuI) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) were purchased from Sinooharm Chemical Reagent Co. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used as the only component of the nonsolvent in the coagulation bath and for all the aqueous solutions.",84
1080,"The synthesis of CuI superstructure nanosheets followed a process similar to our previous report [26]. Commercial CuI powder was first dissolved in acetonitrile by ultrasonication until transparent solution was formed with a concentration of 20 g/L (CuI-acetonitrile adducts solution). Subsequently, 30 mL of PVP aqueous solution (30 g/L) was injected into 10 mL of CuI-acetonitrile adducts solution through a syringe under vigorous magnetic stirring (800 rpm). After stirring for 1 h, the gradually formed white precipitates were collected by the removal of supernatant, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at room temperature.",96
1081,"Asymmetric PSf/CuI superstructure nanosheets membranes were prepared by the NIPS process. For preparing the casting solution, PSf (16 wt%) and PEG (8 wt%) were first dissolved in DMAc (76 wt%) by vigorously stirring at 300 rpm for 12 h under 70 degC. Then different amounts of the prepared CuI superstructure nanosheets (0, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 wt% based on the overall mass of the casting solution) were added into the polymer solution and mechanically stirred for 2 h to form a homogeneous solution. Finally, the solution was degassed under vacuum at 50 degC for 2 h.",96
1082,"The resultant solution was cast onto a nonwoven fabric with a casting knife to obtain a casting film. Then the supported film was coagulated in deionized water at room temperature. The solidified PSf/CuI superstructure nanosheets membranes were thoroughly washed with water to remove the residual DMAc. The prepared MMMs with different loading contents of the CuI superstructure nanosheets (0, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 wt% based on the casting solution) are denoted as PSf, PSf/s-CuI 0.5%, PSf/s-CuI 0.8% and PSf/s-CuI 1.0%, respectively. In addition, we annealed CuI superstructure nanosheets in air in a muffle furnace for 1 h at 280 degC and 350 degC, respectively, for partly and completely converting CuI to CuO. The resulting products were also used as fillers (0.8 wt% based on the casting solution) for preparing the MMMs according to the same method mentioned above. These two samples are denoted as PSf/s-CuI-280 0.8% and PSf/s-CuI-350 0.8%, respectively.",150
1083,"Surface images of the samples were recorded by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM: Hitachi S4800). The membrane samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen to expose their cross sections. A thin layer of Au/Pd alloy was sputter-coated on all the membrane samples, prior to SEM observation operated at 5 kV for acquiring both the surface and cross-sectional morphologies. Transmission electron microscopes (TEM: a JEOL 1010 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and a Hitachi HT7700 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV) were used to obtain TEM images of the CuI superstructure nanosheets and the corresponding ED pattern. The samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic treatment. The suspended particles were transferred to a carbon-coated copper grid and dried. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted from 10deg to 80deg with a scan rate of 0.2deg s-1 with a SmartLab diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation) equipped with a 9 kW rotating anode Cu source at 40 kV and 100 mA.",161
1084,"The water contact angles of the membranes were surveyed on a contact angle goniometer (KRUSS DSA-100, Germany). Deionized water of 1 mL was carefully dropped on the membrane top surface. The measurement was conducted when contact equilibrium was reached between the droplet and the membrane. To minimize the experimental error, at least three different sites were tested for each sample and the average value was reported.",66
1085,"Pure water permeation (PWP) and the retention to BSA were measured with a stirred filtration cell (Amicon Model 8010, Millipore). The effective area of each membrane piece was 4.1 cm2. The PWP (L/(m2 h bar)) was calculated using the following equation:(1)PWP=VAxtxDPwhere V is the volume (L) of the pure water penetrating through the membrane, A is the effective membrane area (m2), t is the operation time (h), and DP is the operation pressure (bar). Most of the UF experiments were carried out at 1 bar.",85
1086,"BSA aqueous solution with a concentration of 0.5 g/L was prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for the retention tests. Retention rates for BSA were determined by measuring the concentrations of BSA in solution using a UV-vis spectrometer (NanoDROP 2000C, Thermo Scientific). The relative intensity of the characteristic BSA peak centered at 280 nm was tracked. The BSA rejection (R) of the UF membrane was calculated using the following equation:(2)R=Cf-CpCfx100%where Cf is the BSA concentration in the feed, and Cp is the BSA concentration in the permeate.",87
1087,"Molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane was determined by using aqueous solutions of dextran with four different molecular weights including 10 kDa, 40 kDa, 70 kDa, and 500 kDa, which concentration was 2.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 1.0 g/L, and 2.0 g/L, respectively. The concentrations of the dextran solutions were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Based on the relation between the rejection value and the molecular weight, the MWCO value was obtained upon 90% rejection of dextran by the membrane.",84
1088,"Tensile strength and percentage elongation of the membranes were measured on testing strips using a microfluidic electronic universal testing machine (CMT6203, SANS, China). The strips with rectangle shape (30 mm length and 10 mm width) were cut from the supported membranes. Then the nonwoven fabrics were removed in liquid nitrogen and only the apparently homogeneous membranes were selected for the mechanical tests. At a constant loading speed of 5 mm/min with the sample holder, tensile strength applied parallel to each strip was measured, which was further converted to tensile stress according to the strip width and the strip thickness obtained from the SEM results of the membrane. The tensile stress vs. strain curves were plotted from the above data.",119
1089,"Thermo-gravimetric (TG) analyses were performed within the range from room temperature to 800 degC on a thermal analyzer (TA TG449F, Netzsch) at a heating rate of 10 degC/min under flowing nitrogen.",31
1090,The copper concentration in the filtrate was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) on a Jarrell-Ash 1100 instrument.,20
1091,"The PWP over time, the fouling resistant ability and the recycling of the PSf membrane and the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane were estimated by measuring the PWP at an operation pressure of 1 bar. The PWP of each membrane was initially measured for 2 h until a steady-state flux (J0) was achieved. Then deionized water was substituted by BSA solution (0.5 g/L in phosphate buffer at pH 7.3) and permeate flux (Jp) was measured for 1 h. Afterwards, the membrane was thoroughly washed by deionized water under magnetic stirring for 20 min, and then the pure water was used to repeat the flux measurement (JR) for 1 h. Finally, the antifouling property of the membranes was evaluated by flux recovery ratio (FRR) using the following equation:(3)FRR=JRJ0x100%",125
1092,"At room temperature CuI is a water insoluble solid. The solvent most frequently used for CuI is acetonitrile (CH3CN) because acetonitrile can strongly solvate CuI by p backbonding, i.e. the electrons from the d-orbital of the Cu atom are partially transferred to the antibonding molecular orbital of acetonitrile. This electron transfer strengthens the Cu-N bond and weakens the Cu-I bond, thus leading to the formation of well-dispersed CuI-acetonitrile adducts [26]. Using acetonitrile/water as a solvent/antisolvent couple, high-yield production of CuI fine particles can be achieved by the antisolvent crystallization method. In this experiment, we first dissolved commercial CuI powder (c-CuI) in 10 mL of acetonitrile to form a transparent solution with a concentration of 20 g/L. Next, 30 mL of PVP aqueous solution (30 g/L) was injected into this solution through the syringe pinhole under vigorous magnetic stirring. A large amount of white colloidal precipitates gradually appeared with the agitating process.",151
1093,"Fig. 1a exhibits an SEM image of the collected precipitates, where sheet-like structures with a rectangular shape are observed. The thickness of a typical sheet shown in the inset of Fig. 1a is only 250 nm, while its width and length are within micrometer scale. The intact nanosheets have well-defined right angles and parallel sides (Fig. 1b). However, a close view reveals that the planar surface of these faceted nanosheets is not smooth and is full of hidden lines, as highlighted in Fig. 1c.",84
1094,"The nanosheets are analogous to fabrics woven by parallel fiber bundles. Therefore, all the obtained nanosheets are not single crystals, but superstructures arranged by small building units. It was suggested that the stabilizing effect of PVP on the initially formed CuI crystal nucleus could restrict their rapid growth through ion-by-ion attachment. In contrast, CuI superstructures with different defined geometries could be gradually developed via oriented attachment using tiny CuI crystals as building blocks [26].",74
1095,"The XRD pattern in Fig. 1h confirms the formation of phase-pure zinc-blende CuI nanosheets (s-CuI). Because the planar surface of s-CuI is favored to place on the substrate, the intensity of diffraction originating from the (111) plane is relatively prevailing in comparison with c-CuI. When we annealed this sample at 280 degC for 1 h in air, part of the CuI was oxidized and converted to CuO (denoted as s-CuI-280), forming a mixed phase of CuI and CuO (Fig. 1h). The oriented alignment of subunits in the sheet-like structure is still maintained while the size of the interparticle pores is significantly enlarged due to the mass loss (Supporting information, Fig. S2a). When the annealing temperature was further elevated to 350 degC, the CuI was completely converted to CuO (denoted as s-CuI-350). As shown in Fig. S2b, the nanosheets initially consisting of densely-arranged building blocks are transformed into aggregates of loosely-connected large crystals with a wide size distribution between 100 and 500 nm.",162
1096,"The surface and cross-sectional SEM images of the PSf membrane (PSf) and the membranes blended with different contents of s-CuI (PSf/s-CuI 0.5%, PSf/s-CuI 0.8%, and PSf/s-CuI 1.0%) are shown in Fig. 2a-d. For comparison, the corresponding SEM images of the hybrid membranes using the 0.8% content of s-CuI-280, s-CuI-350 and c-CuI as fillers (PSf/s-CuI-280 0.8%, PSf/s-CuI-350 0.8%, and PSf/c-CuI 0.8%) are also exhibited in Fig. 2e-g. Based on the surface view, all the blended membranes possess a certain surface roughness with an observable pore structure (Fig. 2b1-g1), similar to the pure PSf membrane (Fig. 2a1). The cross-sectional view (Fig. 2a2-g2) indicates that all the membranes present a typical asymmetric structure consisting of a top skin layer supported by a finger-like porous sub-layer. Moreover, the skin layer of each membrane shows no considerable difference in the thickness. Therefore, the entire pore structure of the PSf UF membrane is only slightly modified by the fillers via the NIPS process, which is probably due to the low additive levels in the MMMs [6,22,28].",170
1097,"For the membranes blended with s-CuI, the XRD patterns in Fig. 2h show gradually enhanced peak intensities of CuI with the increase of s-CuI content. Furthermore, it is revealed that the dispersion of s-CuI is nearly parallel to the membrane surface (Fig. 2b2-d2, b3-d3) even if its content reaches 20 wt% (Fig. S3). The s-CuI filler not only exists in the skin layer with parallel orientation, but spans across multiple pores in the support layer. Relative to the as-prepared s-CuI (Fig. 1a), the thickness of some nanosheets in the MMMs significantly increased, indicating the possible stacking of several nanosheets during the NIPS process. Meanwhile, we did not find any s-CuI on the membrane surface under SEM observations. However, when the annealed samples s-CuI-280 and s-CuI-350 are blended in the PSf membrane, only irregular aggregates are observed in the support layer (Fig. 2e2-f2, e3-f3), although both of them partly inherit the sheet-like morphology prior to the NIPS process. When the c-CuI is used as the filler, the large CuI crystals mostly appear underneath the membrane surface (Fig. 2g2, g3), which severely damages the skin layer by forming big voids.",188
1098,"The wettability of PSf/s-CuI membrane surfaces was evaluated by measuring the static water contact angles. As displayed in Fig. 3, the PSf membrane shows a relatively high contact angle of 71.6deg. After incorporation of the s-CuI filler with the content from 0.5 wt% to 1.0 wt%, the contact angle of the MMMs gradually decreases. Nevertheless, the improvement on the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces is rather slight. We observe that the contact angle only decreases to 60.4deg when the content of the s-CuI filler reaches 1.0 wt%. In contrast, the water contact angle on the surface of stacked sheets of s-CuI is significantly down to 38.7deg, much more hydrophilic than that of the PSf membrane. Therefore, the s-CuI filler or its fragments does not directly expose on the membrane surface and impact on the surface wettability, which is in agreement with the SEM observations (Fig. 2). The increase in hydrophilicity of the PSf/s-CuI membrane surfaces mainly originates from the alteration of the inherent surface energy and pore structure of the PSf membrane subjected to the blending of the s-CuI filler [30].",181
1099,"The PSf membrane has been widely exploited for UF applications because it is practical to prepare the asymmetric structure containing a separating layer and a support layer by the NIPS process. Its permeability and rejection are generally determined by the surface pore size and membrane porosity. Fig. 4 summarizes the pure water permeation (PWP) and BSA rejection of the pure PSf membrane and the associated MMMs prepared in our experiment. The PSf membrane provides a PWP of 556 L/(m2 h bar) and a retention of 58.2% to BSA in average. With the incorporation of the s-CuI filler, the PWP significantly increases and reaches a maximum of 1473 L/(m2 h bar) at a loading content of 0.8 wt%, which is more than 2.6 times higher than that of the pure PSf membrane. When the loading content is further increased to 1.0 wt%, the PWP recedes to 1200 L/(m2 h bar).",149
1100,"Overall, the trend of the PWP shows a convex profile with the increasing s-CuI content. In contrast, the increment of the BSA rejection continues until a plateau is reached. At the 0.8 wt% and 1.0 wt% loading contents, the MMMs present a comparable maximal BSA rejection up to ~92%. The above results indicate that the permeability/selectivity tradeoff relationship in the PSf membrane is overcome upon incorporation of the s-CuI filler. It is also determined that the 0.8 wt% loading content of s-CuI is optimal for enhancing both water flux and separation performance of the MMMs.",95
1101,"It is well accepted that the addition of hydrophilic substance in the casting solution can modify the kinetics and thermodynamics of the formation process of the polymeric membrane [27,31]. At optimal loading contents, the surface hydrophilicity of the fillers intensifies the thermodynamic immiscibility of the system and accelerates the solvent and nonsolvent exchange rate [5,32]. Hence, the surface characteristics of the fashioned membrane can be altered, and formation of a more porous structure is favored. The blending of the fillers in polymer matrix can also disrupt the polymer chain packing, thus yielding new polymer/filler interfacial areas and changing the free volume and molecular transport of the hybrid membrane [14,16]. Normally, interfacial microvoids are spontaneously formed between the two phases due to the existent defects and interfacial stresses, which lower the intrinsic resistance and improve the membrane permeability to a certain extent.",141
1102,"We further investigated the impact of the annealed s-CuI fillers with the identical 0.8 wt% content on the membrane performance. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the PSf/s-CuI-280 0.8% membrane presents a PWP of 1463 L/(m2 h bar), similar to that of the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane, but its BSA rejection declines from 92.4% to 79.8%. The PWP of the PSf/s-CuI-350 0.8% membrane reaches a greater value of 1607 L/(m2 h bar), while its BSA rejection further drops to 76.2%. Due to the removal of the PVP protective layer subsequent to annealing at elevated temperatures, the PSf/s-CuI-280 0.8% and PSf/s-CuI-350 0.8% membranes present reduced PSf/filler interfacial compatibility. The formation of unselective voids associated with interfacial defects in the separating layer enhances the water flux, but at expense of the deterioration of the BSA rejection. When c-CuI with the 0.8 wt% content is added as the filler, the obtained PSf/c-CuI 0.8% membrane is leaky, resulting in loss of selectivity. Considering the separating layer of the PSf membrane is skinny, the large isodimensional c-CuI particles almost ruined the barrier and failed to function as compatible filler.",182
1103,"The level of BSA rejections in the range of 60-90% indicates that the MMMs blended with the s-CuI and the annealed s-CuI fillers are all in the UF range. Especially, the BSA retention of the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane is maintained at 92.4% while its PWP attains 1463 L/(m2 h bar), which is significantly higher than the values of MMMs prepared by filling polymer-grafted TiO2 nanoparticles [33] and chitosan derivatives [34] in the PSf matrix (31 and 115 L/(m2 h bar) on the premise of ~90% BSA retentions).",87
1104,"Molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) value is defined by 90% rejection of organic solutes by membranes [35], so we also tested the MWCO of the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane with the superior UF performance. Its MWCO curve referring to dextran of various molecular weights is exhibited in Fig. 5, in which the MWCO (90% dextran rejection) of the MMM is determined as 122 kDa. Since the molecular weight of BSA is 67 kDa, the MMM should only offer a BSA rejection rate lower than 80%. However, the obtained retention to BSA is unexpectedly up to ~90%. In addition to the different concentrations accepted for the tests of BSA rejection and dextran MWCO, a more crucial reason might lie in the ellipsoidal shape of BSA molecules, which makes them more difficult to penetrate the membrane pores compared with glucose molecules with a linear thread-like shape [36].",143
1105,"Because the mechanical properties of organic-inorganic hybrid membranes usually relate to the flexibility of organic matrix and the stiffness of inorganic filler, we measured the stress-strain curves of the PSf membrane and the MMMs blended with different contents of s-CuI for evaluating the effect of the s-CuI incorporation on their mechanical stability. As shown in Fig. 6, the PSf membrane possesses a typical inferior mechanical stability with a tensile strength of 2.36 MPa and an elongation of 7.9% at break. The well-dispersed s-CuI in the PSf matrix significantly enhances the mechanical strength of the membranes at low loadings. For instance, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the PSf/s-CuI 0.5% membrane are sharply improved to 3.78 MPa and 11.5%, respectively. When the content of s-CuI increases to 0.8 wt%, the mechanical strength of the membrane is more enhanced by allowing a tensile strength of 4.43 MPa and an elongation of 12.7% at break. Further increase of the filler loading fraction to 1.0 wt% results in somewhat decreased tensile strength at break of the membrane, while its elongation attains 13.9%.",180
1106,"In a pressure-driven process such as UF, long-term operation could induce the interfacial slippage and the collapse of the membrane pores, thus incurring the risks of filler leakage from the membranes [5,15]. Hence, along with the investigation on the pure water flux of the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane, we additionally examined the copper concentration in the filtrate by ICP-AES. The result shows that the copper concentration in the filtrate is only in a range of 21-40 ppb, much lower than the WHO's reference standard for copper in drinking water (1000 ppb). The insignificant amount of the filler leaching from the membrane further confirms the adequate interaction between the PSf/s-CuI constituents favored by a molecular-level synergic effect.",115
1107,"The comparison of PSf/s-CuI and other PSf MMMs is summarized in Table S2. Our PSf/s-CuI shows better performance at BSA rejection and permeation. The permeability of PSf/s-CuI is particularly higher with a small concentration of CuI addition, compared to other inorganic filler MMMs such as functionalized carbon nanotubes, TiO2 and SiO2.",51
1108,"In this work, we succeeded in utilizing 2D superstructures as fillers in the mixed-matrix PSf membrane by the NIPS process. In the case study we presented, sheet-like superstructures self-assembled by CuI nanoparticles were converted directly from commercial CuI powders. We revealed that the polymer PVP first acted as an effective structure-directing agent to regulate the self-assembly of tiny CuI building blocks, then functioned as a compatilizer to promote the dispersity of the s-CuI filler in the PSf matrix. At 0.8 wt% loading content of s-CuI, the hybrid membrane displayed optimal UF performance with a PWP of 1473 L/(m2 h bar) and a BSA rejection of 92%, while the pure PSf membrane only displayed a PWP of 556 L/(m2 h bar) and a BSA rejection of 58.2%. We also verified that the enhancement of mechanical stability for the PSf/s-CuI 0.8% membrane was most significant and the leakage of its s-CuI filler was negligible. This case study indicates that it is highly promising to employ designable superstructures as functional fillers to construct novel MMMs, which will broaden the application of MMMs in membrane separation processes.",183

1112,"Nowadays, due to the high population growth and fast industrialization, the use of different organic pollutants have been increased. Industries such as pharmaceutical, chemicals and textile have become the main sources of water pollution [1]. The introduction of membrane bioreactor (MBR) for wastewater treatment has gained much attention in recent years because of their unique features including space requirement, excellent effluent quality, less hydraulic retention time and less sludge production [2-4]. In fact, MBR has become an accepted option to be considered for water reuse applications [5].",87
1113,"ND silanization can bring high specific surface area and excellent dispersibility, which may help solve the problem of NDs aggregation and reduce membrane fouling. In fact, the alkoxy groups, OR, enable the silane to be anchored to surface functional groups like hydroxyl groups while organic functionality, R, is responsible for improving the compatibility of nanoparticles with organic matrices [27]. Many studies have been done to get the best dispersion of silanized nanoparticles in polymeric matrices. For example, Ma et al. [28] embedded silanized carbon nanotubes as the reinforcement agent in epoxy matrix and the results indicated that the functional groups on the surface of MWCNT enhanced its compatibility with epoxy [28]. In other work, silanized TiO2 nanoparticles were embedded into PES nanocomposite membranes and the results showed that the dispersion of nanoparticles within the PES was improved [29]. Other researches also have been done on the silanization of CNTs and ND nanoparticles and it has been concluded that silanization is one of the most effective methods to improve the compatibility as well as the dispersion of nanoparticles within the polymeric matrix [30,31].",182
1114,"In this study, ND nanoparticles were functionalized by silanization method. The ND and SND nanoparticles were then incorporated into the PSf membranes during phase inversion process. The influence of ND and SND nanoparticles in the structure, morphology, performance and hydrophilicity of the PSf membrane was investigated. After characterization, the membranes were used in an MBR system and finally, classic models were used to investigate fouling behavior of the membranes.",69
1115,"Udel P-1700 polysulfone was purchased from Solvay Advanced Polymer LLC and used as polymer. N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidon (NMP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW = 20,000 g/gmol) were purchased from Daejung and Sigma, respectively. The pristine detonation ND nanoparticles with a phase purity higher than 95% were procured from Nabond technology Co., Ltd., China. The average diameter and specific surface area of ND nanoparticles were about 5 nm and 282.8 m2 g-1, respectively. Vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTS) with the purity of 97% from Merck was used for silane functionalization of ND nanoparticles. The following materials were used with no other purification: ethanol (99.8%, Sigma), acetone (99%, Merck) and acetic acid (99.85%, Sigma). Influent wastewater and adapted activated sludge were supplied by the wastewater treatment plat of Dana pharmaceutical company, Iran, and used as MBR feed.",130
1116,"At first, carboxylation of NDs was carried out by thermal oxidation, 0.6 g of ND nanoparticles were thermally oxidized at 425 degC for 4 h. Carboxylated ND (ND-COOH) was then reacted with hydrolyzed VTS by esterification method leading to SND nanoparticles [31]. The silanization process was performed by preparing 80 ml solution of distilled water/ethanol (20:80 v/v) and its pH was adjusted to 3.5-4.5 by adding acetic acid. The desired amount of VTS was then added to the solution followed by stirring at ambient temperature for 30 min which leads to hydrolysis of the silane. According to the literature, the best weight ratio of (VTS/ND-COOH, w/w) is 5:1; so 0.3 g of ND-COOH was then added to the solution and dispersed by ultrasonic bath (120 W, 28 kHz) for an hour. Then, it was stirred at 65 degC for 4 h. Afterwards, the suspension was placed in an oven at 120 degC for 4 h. Eventually, SND nanoparticles were washed repeatedly with acetone and distilled water and dried at 120 degC for 12 h.",174

Moreover, FESEM (MIRA3 FEG-SEM, Tescan) was used to visualize the morphology of both ND and SND nanoparticles. For this purpose, the nanoparticles were dispersed into alcohol solution using an ultrasound system for at least 15 min and then dropped onto a microscope slide for observation.",67
1118,"Neat and nanocomposite PSf membranes were prepared via non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The composition of dope solutions is reported in Table 1. For nanocomposite membranes, desired amount of nanoparticles were dispersed in NMP using probe sonicator (Sonopuls HD 3200, Bandelin) for at least 30 min. Then, polymer and PEG were added to the dispersion. In order to reach a homogenous solution, the mixture was stirred by a mechanical stirrer at 60 degC for at least 8 h. The casting solution was then degassed for about 15 h without stirring to remove gas bubbles. Afterward, the prepared solution was cast onto a flat glass plate by using an automatic casting knife (casting rate: 10 mm/s, membranes thickness: 150 mm). After casting, the film was immersed in a water bath in order to initiate phase inversion process. For neat PSf membrane, the measured amount of PSf and PEG were added to the solvent (NMP), and for nanocomposite membrane, the weight percent of ND and SND in the solution was 1.0%. All the prepared membranes were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and dried at 70 degC.",185
1119,"In order to determine the hydrophilicity characteristics of the membranes, the contact angle goniometer (PGX, Thwing-Albert Instrument Co.) was used to measure the contact angle between membrane surface and water droplet. DI water was used as the probe liquid for all measurements. The results were the average of at least five tests at different locations on the membrane surface. Also, the mechanical strength of membranes was measured by a tensile testing machine (STM-5, SANTAM, Iran). All samples for mechanical testing were in rectangular shape and at extension rate of 10 mm/min. The measurements were carried out at least 3 times for each membrane and the average values were reported.",109
1120,"The morphology of prepared membranes was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; MIRA3 FEG-SEM, Tescan). In order to prepare the cross-section samples, membranes were fractured using liquid nitrogen. Afterwards, for making the membranes conductive before observation, they were coated with gold by sputtering process. FESEM device was equipped with dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) detector to inspect the existence as well as dispersion of SND nanoparticles in the membrane structure. Moreover, after analyzing the surface FESEM images of membranes using ImageJ software, the pore size distribution of each membrane was investigated.",92
1121,"For a specific feed-membrane system, (Jc) is the critical flux that particles start to accumulate and fluxes above the Jc will cause irreversible fouling. In order to determine the critical flux, the TMP-step method was used as described by Gesan-Guiziou et al. [32]. This method consists of systematic increase of DP (30 min at each DP step before reaching Jc, 15 min afterwards). At the time that J decreased over the course of time, causing a non-linearity in the J = f (DP) relationship, it means that deposition has occurred and so hydraulic resistance increases dramatically. According to the flux-TMP behaviors, the obtained results could be divided into lower flux groups with less fouling and higher flux groups with more fouling. Therefore, the critical flux of the system can be determined as the intersection of mentioned lines.",137
1122,"To investigate the anti-fouling performance of the prepared membranes, flux recovery ratio (FRR), total fouling ratio (TFR), reversible fouling ratio (RFR) and irreversible fouling ratio (IFR) were calculated by using the following procedure. After performing the pure water flux test (Jw1), the flux of activated sludge (JAS) was calculated based on the collected water weight at sub-critical conditions for 360 min during the MBR filtration. The fouled membranes were washed with DI water and then the pure water flux was recorded again as Jw2. According to the JAS, Jw1 and Jw2 values, All the anti-fouling parameters were calculated through the following equations [11]:(2)FRR(%)=Jw2Jw1x100(3)RFR(%)=(Jw2-JASJw1)x100(4)IFR(%)=(Jw1-Jw2Jw1)x100(5)TFR(%)=RFR(%)+IFR(%)=(Jw1-JASJw1)x100",103
1123,"For a more detailed study on the fouling property of the prepared membranes, Hermia models were proposed describing four mechanisms responsible for flux decline [11]. For a constant pressure filtration system, the flux decline can be expressed in the following mathematical form:(6)d2tdV2=kdtdVmwhere t (h) is filtration time, V (m3) in the filtrate volume and k & m are constant kinetics parameters. Having the flux equation on the hand:(7)J=1AdVdtthe flux decline expression can be expressed by Eq. (8):(8)dJdt=-kA2-mJ3-m",77
1124,"According to the Hermia model, four fouling mechanisms are presented. In the cake filtration model (m = 0), the particles are only placed on the surface of the membrane due to their size and can't enter the membrane pores. For intermediate blocking model (m = 1), particles can block surface pores or they are attached to the particles that already have blocked some pores. In standard blocking model (m = 1.5), it is assumed that the particles are so small that they can enter the pores of the membrane and deposit on the internal pore walls which cause reduction in the size of them. And for the complete blocking model (m = 2) the particles are in the same size with the membrane pore size so it blocks the surface pores of the membrane and reduces the number of the open pores [33].",143
1125,"Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of ND and SND nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption peaks at 2923 and 2852 cm-1 for ND nanoparticles are allocated to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of CH bond, respectively [34]. Also, the absorption peaks at 3438 and 1622 cm-1 are attributed to the stretching and deformation vibration of OH bond respectively [34,35]. Absorption peaks at 1711 and 1113 cm-1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of carbonyl, CO and COC groups, respectively [31,36]. For the SND nanoparticles, absorption peak at 1129 cm-1 is assigned to SiOC and it confirms the presence of silane functional groups on the surface of ND [31]. Also absorption peaks at 760 cm-1 and 1038 cm-1 are due to the stretching vibration absorption of Si-C and Si-O-Si bond respectively [37]. The FESEM images of pristine and modified ND nanoparticles at different magnifications are represented in Fig. 3. It depicts that the ND nanoparticles have successfully modified and functionalized nanoparticles are less agglomerated in the alcohol solution compared to dense samples of pristine NDs; it can be attributed to the presence of functional groups on the surface of the modified NDs.",195
1126,"Investigating the pore size distribution (PSD) of membranes can be a useful method for understanding the effect of nanoparticles on the morphology of prepared membranes. The results of pore size distribution of the membranes are shown in Fig. 5. In order to plot the curves, the surface images of the prepared membranes were analyzed by ImageJ software. It can be seen that by embedding the nanoparticles into the polymeric matrix, the mean pore size is shifted towards smaller pores. In fact, the presence of nanoparticles caused more surface pores with smaller sizes. Therefore, we may expect that the water permeation of the fabricated membranes will increase by the addition of ND and SND nanoparticles, and the rejection of membranes increases due to pore size reduction as well.",127
1127,"In order to investigate the existence of SND nanoparticles on the PSf/SND (1 wt%) membrane, the EDX analysis was carried out based on Si element and the results are presented in Fig. 6. As it can be seen, a peak observed around 1.7 keV belongs to Si in SND nanoparticles and the peak around 2.5 keV belongs to sulfur. EDX mapping analyze was also carried out in order to investigate the distribution of SND nanoparticles in polymeric matrix and obtained results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be observed that SND nanoparticles are evenly distributed in the polymer matrix.",100
1128,"The results of the mechanical strength of neat and nanocomposite membranes are also reported in Table 3. As can be seen, the presence of ND and SND nanoparticles had no significant effect on the mechanical strength of membranes. Actually, the addition of 1 wt% ND nanoparticles reduced the mechanical strength from 5.60 MPa to 5.06 MPa, which may be due to the agglomeration of NDs in polymeric matrix and the same results were also reported by Behboudi et al [42]. On the other hand, according to the cross-sectional images of membranes, it is obvious that the addition of SNDs increased the size of the inner pores and thus, there was an improvement in porosity of the membranes. Since mechanical strength and porosity have inverse relationship, it was expected that by increasing the porosity, mechanical strength will decrease but due to the good interaction between the polymeric matrix and SND nanoparticles, mechanical strength stayed stable. According to the results reported by Zhang et al. [10], silanization can diminish particle surface energy and prevents particle agglomeration, so they can be uniformly dispersed inside membrane which will contribute to improvement of the membrane properties.",191
1129,"Critical flux (Jc) has been obtained by transmembrane pressure (TMP)-step method with constant TMP mode. Fig. 8 shows the variation of permeation flux versus transmembrane pressure (TMP) for neat PSf, PSf/ND (1 wt%) and PSf/SND (1 wt%) membranes. The critical flux is considered as a point which shows non-linearity in the flux-TMP relationship. For all the membranes, the first unstable point emerges in 0.12 bar resulting in non-linearity in the J = f (TMP) relationship and it represents the simultaneous effect of particles deposition and compressed cake formation of activated sludge on the membrane surface [43]. Therefore, the critical flux of neat PSf, PSf/ND (1 wt%) and PSf/SND (1 wt%) membranes were determined as 17.8, 24.0 and 27.2 Lm-2 h-1, respectively. The membrane properties can effect on critical flux behavior and these results indicate the effect of ND and SND nanoparticles on the critical flux of PSF membranes.",148
1130,"Pure water flux values of prepared membranes are reported in Table 3. As it can be seen, PWF of neat PSf membrane is 36 L/m2.h but at the present of 1 wt% ND nanoparticles, PWF declined to 19.2 L/m2.h. This can be due to the agglomeration of ND nanoparticles within PSf membrane because ND nanoparticles are hydrophilic in nature and it was expected that pure water flux of PSf/ND membrane would be higher than PSf membrane. The similar results were also reported by Zhao et al [44]. On the other hand, pure water flux of PSf/SND membrane increased up to 112 L/m2.h which is 3.1 times of PWF of PSf membrane. As shown in Fig. 4c, the addition of SND nanoparticles resulted in the improvement of membrane hydrophilicity, which might also act in increasing the water flux and promoting the formation of more pores on surface of the membrane. Additionally, hydrophilicity is an important factor to avoid fouling formation as foulants would not be trapped in the voids of a surface. The similar results were also reported by Teli et al. [9].",182
1131,"The time-dependent filtration of MBR in TMP = 0.1 bar for all the membranes is presented in Fig. 9. The flux of ND and SND nanocomposite membranes was higher than that of neat PSf membrane in sub-critical conditions. Thus, membrane hydrophilicity has shown its effectiveness in improving activated sludge filtration flux. Moreover, the slope of the flux decline of PSf/SND (1 wt%) membrane is sharper than other membranes at the beginning of the filtration. It can be attributed to the much higher initial flux of filtration which leads to higher concentration polarization and thus higher flux decline during the time. However, after 360 min filtration process, the final flux of PSf/SND (1 wt%) membrane is still higher than other membranes which is due to the presence of hydrophilic nanoparticles on the surface of the membrane.",135
1132,"Fig. 10 shows the fitting of the gained experimental data under sub-critical conditions (TMP = 0.1 bar) for prepared membranes to various predicted fouling mechanisms, consists of cake formation, standard pore blocking, intermediate pore blocking and complete pore blocking. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the cake filtration model (m = 0) is the best fit for PSf/SND (1 wt.%) membrane which is classified as reversible fouling and it can be removed easily by physical cleaning. The adjusted values of k and correlation coefficient; R2 for the neat and nanocomposite membranes are listed in Table 4.",97
1133,"RFR is also a kind of fouling which can be removed by physical membrane cleaning like routine hydraulic backwashing [49]. According to the results reported in Table 5, RFR value has increased from 6.66% for pure PSf to 37.50% for PSf/SND (1 wt%). Besides, although for PSf/SND (1 wt%) membrane the value of TFR is the highest, it should be noted that the RFR value is the smallest, which means membrane can be cleaned by physical treatment and chemical cleaning is unnecessary. So the PSf/SND (1 wt%) membrane with the lowest IFR and highest RFR value has the best anti-fouling properties.",101
1134,"ND nanoparticles were functionalized by silanization method to overcome the agglomeration of ND within PSf membrane. The presence of SND in PSf matrix increased the hydrophilicity and pure water flux due to the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the SND nanoparticles. The results of MBR run revealed that both PSf/ND and PSf/SND nanocomposite membranes possessed higher flux recovery ratio and lower irreversible fouling compared to neat PSf membrane which was attributed to the membrane surface properties such as hydrophilicity and pore size distribution. In conclusion, this study showed that silanization of ND nanoparticles is a promising method to get the better dispersion of ND in PSf matrix and PSf/SND membrane can be considered as a potential choice for the development of high-performance membranes in membrane bioreactor systems.",132

1136,"The performance of membrane material plays an important role in the membrane application, operational condition, operational cost and effluent quality of the wastewater treatment system [1-3]. The high molecular weight of PSf makes this polymer suitable for use in membrane filtrations particularly for water [4,5], pharmaceutical [6], textile dyeing [7,8], desalination [9], peat water [10] and sewage wastewater [11] treatment systems. The excellent mechanical strength, its stability at pH levels from 2 to 13, excellent resistance to caustic and good resistance to moderate chlorine are qualities of PSf which make it suitable to be used for membrane filtration even though it is hydrophobic in nature [5,11-16]. In detail, the excellent mechanical strength ensures the membranes are able to operate at higher pressure, the capability of PSf which can withstand from low to high pH range allows the filtration process to operate at high temperature [6] and the good tolerance to moderate chlorine makes it very suitable for use in any water and wastewater filtration system. However, the hydrophobic nature of PSf membranes means that the flux obtained from the filtration is low. Therefore, PSf membranes need some surface modification to enhance the permeation of water molecules.",196
1137,"All chemicals used in this work were of analytical reagent grade unless otherwise stated. Commercial 1.3 mm outer diameter of polyester (PET) braid support was purchased from Philos (South Korea). PSf was purchased from Solvay Specialty Polymer (UDEL(r) P-3500 LCD MB7). N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as solvent was purchased from QReC Chemicals. Zinc acetate (Zn (CH3CO2)2), oxalic acid (C2H2O4), ethanol (C2H5OH) and BSA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.",65
1138,"ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by a previously reported sol-gel method [37,38]. 0.1 M zinc acetate and 0.1 M oxalic acid mixtures (Zn (CH3CO2)2/C2H2O4) were prepared with gentle stirring in ethanol for 30 min at 60 +- 5 degC and 50 +- 5 degC respectively. The oxalic acid solution was added dropwise to the zinc acetate solution at 60 +- 5 degC. The mixture was then left under vigorous magnetic stirring for 90 min to allow for complete reaction in order to obtain a gel-like zinc oxalate. The operating pH of 2.0 +- 0.2 was obtained by initially adding oxalic acid to the zinc acetate mixture. The resulting gel was then dried at 60 degC overnight in an oven to form the precursors for the ZnO nanoparticles which then underwent calcination at temperatures of 400 degC for 3 h. The chemical reactions of the ZnO synthesis with a suitable temperature for the calcination are summarized as below.(1)Zn(CH3COO)2+H2C2O460degC-ZnC2O4+2CH3COOH(2)ZnC2O4400degC-ZnO+CO+CO2+2H2O",156
1139,"Eq. (1) shows the reaction between the starting materials of zinc acetate and oxalic acid to form the zinc oxalate precursor. Eq. (2) shows the precursor undergoing calcination to ensure the removal of impurities and excess carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water. Hence, a high purity of ZnO nanoparticles was obtained.",51
1140,"The hybrid ZnO/PSf BHFMs were fabricated through phase inversion method [39]. The compositions of the dope solutions to fabricated ZnO/PSf BHFMs are as shown in Table 1. In short, ZnO nanoparticles were dissolved in DMAc and stirred vigorously for 30 min at 70 degC until homogenous. The obtained solution was then ultrasonicated under ambient conditions for 2 h to promote dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles in the dope solution. Then PSf pallets were added into the ZnO/DMAc mixture and stirred vigorously for 6 h at 70 degC. The prepared dope solution was degassed for 2 h to remove bubbles formed during stirring and stored in the oven at 60 degC for 24 h to remove any residual bubbles. As shown in Table 1, the ZnO/PSf dope solutions were prepared with various ZnO nanoparticles loading concentrations, i.e., 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt%, and labeled as BHFM1, BHFM2, BHFM3 and BHFM4 respectively. Neat PSf HFM was fabricated as a benchmark for the BHFM characterizations.",162
1141,"Meanwhile, self-supported HFM was fabricated via dry-jet wet spinning method using a tube and orifice spinneret with internal diameter of 1.5 mm and outer diameter of 3.0 mm. Reverse osmosis water and tap water were used for internal and external coagulation of the membrane fabrication process respectively. Table 2 shows the spinning parameters that were adopted to fabricate the HFM and BHFMs. The fabricated HFM was immersed in water for 24 h to remove the solvent residue. Both HFM and BHFMs were post-treated with 30 wt% glycerol solution prior to characterization.",91
1142,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of synthesized ZnO nanoparticles were investigated in 2th range from 10deg to 80deg using Bruker diffractometer with Cu_K-beta radiation. The morphologies of the HFM and BHFMs were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM; Model: TM 3000, Hitachi). Prior to the SEM analysis, the HFM was fractured under liquid nitrogen for a clean break, while the BHFMs were cut to clean cross-section by using a surgical scalpel after the BHFMs have been soaked in liquid nitrogen for 5 min. The clean fractured/cut membranes were then sputtered for 5-10 min until a thin platinum layer (around 10 nm) coated the surface of the sample to capture high quality cross-sectional images. The SEM images were captured at x60 and x800 magnification. The separating layer thickness of the HFM and BHFMs was measured at 10 selected locations for each cross-section. The outer and inner diameter of the HFM and BHFMs were measured at 3 different randomly selected locations for each cross-section. Surface hydrophilicity was determined via sessile-drop method (Model: OCA 15EC, Dataphysic). The contact angle measurement was taken at 5 randomly selected locations of BHFMs to yield an average result.",190
1143,"Water flux experiments were conducted in a membrane module filtration apparatus. For each module, one fiber with 10 cm length was assembled into the filtration module and a pure water flux measurement performed in a cross-flow mode through outside-in configuration. Each membrane sample was tested at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 bar trans-pressure in order to get the permeability of the membranes. Compressed distilled water was used as the permeate for pure water flux measurements. The flux permeation of the membranes was calculated according to Eqs. (3) and (4):(3)F=VAxt(4)A=pd0Lwhere F is the membrane flux (L/m2 h), V is the volume of permeate at time t (L), A is the effective filtration area of the membrane (m2), do is the outer diameter of hollow fibers (cm) and L is the effective length of hollow fibers (cm).",139
1144,"Rejection test was conducted in membrane module filtration apparatus using bovine serum albumin (BSA: Molecular weight of 66,000 Da). This BSA rejection test was done to confirm the class of fabricated BHFMs are in the ultrafiltration range [41]. Chiam and Sarbatly reported that the molecular weight range for testing ultrafiltration membranes is from 20,000 Da to 500,000 Da [42]. The molecule's radius of 66,000 Da BSA can be calculated by Eq. (5):(5)a=0.33M0.46where a represents the molecule radius (nm) and M represents the molecular weight (Da). According to this equation, the molecular radius of this 66,000 Da BSA is 54.4 nm. The molecular radius of BSA is within the ultrafiltration pores range (10-100 nm) and smaller than microfiltration pores range (100-1000 nm). Thus, BSA was used to evaluate the rejection rate of the fabricated membranes.",134
1145,"2 L of 1000 ppm BSA solution was loaded into the membrane module filtration apparatus and 10 cm of each BHFMs were assembled in the system. The rejection analysis was performed in a cross-flow mode through outside-in configuration. All the loaded membrane samples were tested from 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 bar trans-pressure, same as the permeability test. The membranes were rinsed with deionized water for 5 min after each circle of the filtration test. The rejection is defined using Eq. (6):(6)R=1-CpCfx100%where R is the BSA rejection rate (%), and Cp and Cf represent the concentrations of BSA in the permeate and feed solutions respectively. The determination of BSA content in influent and effluent solutions was measured using UV-Vis spectrophotometer (DR5000, HACH) with absorption wavelength of 278 nm.",132
1146,The mechanical strengths of the braid support and best-performing BHFM were measured using tensile testing apparatus (AG-X Plus). Samples of length 150 mm with clamping distance of 100 mm were placed vertically between a pair of pneumatic clamps and stretched at 20 mm/min at upper clamp. The tensile stress of the samples were recorded at the maximum force on samples to break. Three specimens were tested to get the average tensile stress value.,73
1147,"Fig. 2 represents the XRD pattern recorded for the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles. The obtained nanoparticles are polycrystalline and the diffraction data agreed well with JCPDS card of ZnO nanoparticles (JCPDS 36-1451) with 2th peaks at t 31.633deg (100), 34.278deg (002), 36.115deg (101), 47.403deg (102), 56.472deg (110), 62.693deg (103), 67.813deg (112), 68.975deg (201) and 72.42deg (202). The pattern does not contain any other impurity peaks which proves the pure quality of the synthesized nanoparticles. This result pattern is corresponding to the results obtained by Borker and Desai [43]. They observed major diffraction peaks at 31.73deg, 34.39deg, 36.24deg, 47.51deg, 56.52deg, 62.88deg, 72.54deg and 76.89deg which assigned as (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), (201) and (202) planes respectively. The crystalline size of the nanoparticles were calculated using Hall-Williamson method [38]. The average crystallite size of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles were 10 +- 1.8 nm.",143
1148,"The morphological examination by SEM analysis in Fig. 3 shows that the fabricated HFM membrane is highly porous compared to the BHFMs. Finger-like structures were observed in both HFM and BHFMs. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the morphology of a neat PSf HFM. The membrane exhibits well-defined structures, i.e. tiny finger-like at its selective outer layers, large and repetitive macro voids underneath the selective layer and well-distributed finger-like structures at bottom layer. Fig. 3(c) and (d) show the morphology of the BHFM1. The membrane exhibits well-defined membrane structure, i.e., finger-like and microvoids at its outer selective layer, macro voids underneath selective layer, sponge structures underneath the macro voids and a small amount of the PSf coating solution which infiltrated into the braid support. This morphology is corresponding to the result shown by Zhou et al. [44]. Two skin layers were observed in the HFM, whereas in BHFMs only one skin layer was observed. Fig. 3(e)-(j) shows the PSf BHFM incorporated with different loadings of ZnO nanoparticles. The loading of the ZnO nanoparticles were increased to 0.5 wt% (Fig. 3(e) and (f)), 1.0 wt% (Fig. 3(f) and (g)) and 1.5 wt% (Fig. 3(h) and (i)).",194
1149,"The water contact angles of BHFM1, BHFM2, BHFM3 and BHFM4 are 108.79deg, 83.54deg, 77.04deg and 71.02deg respectively (Table 4). The presence of ZnO nanoparticles in PSf BHFM has improved its hydrophilicity by at least 37.77deg, which can be explained as the large number of oxidized functional groups on the surface of the membrane after modification, which has a positive effect on improving the hydrophilicity of the membranes [49]. The contact angle results correspond to the result shown by Pintilie et al. [50], where they reported that the presence of 1.0 wt% of ZnO in PSf HFM improved the hydrophilicity by 23.50deg. Balta et al. reported that 2.0 wt% of ZnO nanoparticles in the PES membrane dropped the contact angle significantly from 70.00deg to about 57.00deg. This shows that the incorporation of the ZnO nanoparticles has significantly modified the membrane surface to be more hydrophilic.",144
1150,The water flux and BSA rejection rate of neat PSf HFM and all BHFMs are depicted in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows that the BHFM4 has a higher flux of 919.12 L/m2 h and an average of 97.34% BSA rejection rate compared to neat PSf HFM (with an average flux of 346.20 L/m2 h and BSA rejection of 49.20%) and other ZnO/PSf BHFMs at 1.0 bar pressure. The high flux of BHFM4 is due to the OH of ZnO nanoparticles in the membrane separation layer which absorbs water molecules and the strong electronegativity of ZnO nanoparticles which has hindered the adsorption and deposition of BSA proteins in membrane separation layer.,110
1151,"The braid's fabric nature to absorb the filtrated water molecules as well as the porous structure of braid support also contributed to the high flux. Despite that, the reduced thickness of the membrane separation layer in BHFMs compared to self-supported HFMs (as shown in Table 3) also contributed to the increase in water flux. Overall, both the thin hydrophilic separation layer and the high water-attracting character of the braid support have played an important role in this high flux achievement.",80
1152,"On the basis of BSA rejection, all BHFMs were able to remove more than 90% of BSA. This result indicates that the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles gives better flux performance than BSA rejection. This result pattern is corresponding to the results obtained by Adilah et al. and Abdi et al. [45,51].",51
1153,"In summary, the BHFM incorporated with different loadings of ZnO nanoparticles has successfully been fabricated via dry-wet phase inversion technique. The fabricated membrane possessed good morphology with finger-like voids on the outer separation layer, sponge-like structure and good adhesion with braid support. When the ZnO nanoparticle content reached 1.5 wt%, the morphology of BHFM had good infiltration rate of dope solution into the braid support due to the hydrophilic nature of the ZnO/PSf doping solution, which also promoted a good interfacial bond between the separation layer and braid support. The infiltration rate of dope solution has developed different thicknesses of separation layers in all BHFMs. The incorporation of 1.5 wt% of ZnO nanoparticles in PSf BHFM membrane also increased the hydrophilic properties of the BHFM from 108.79deg to 71.021deg. High water permeability and an excellent BSA rejection rate (97.1%) were achieved at 1.5 wt% of ZnO nanoparticles compared to 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 wt% BHFMs. Good fouling stability and recovery after three cycles of BSA filtration were observed. The results show that the BHFM exhibit high mechanical strength and remarkable elongation which makes this membrane have a high potential application prospect in wastewater treatments.",193
1154,"Altogether, the hybrid ZnO /PSf BHFM exhibits superior hydrophilicity and higher permeability compared with neat PSf BHFM and PSf HFM. Additionally, it was also observed that the BHFMs are able operate at higher pressures up to 4.0 bar easily with > 90% rejection rate, compared to HFM which collapsed at 1.5 bar pressure in this research work. 1.5 wt% ZnO nanoparticle in 16 wt% PSf BHFM appears to be the most promising range in improvising hydrophilicity and permeability.",78

1158,"Following the development of a practical cellulose acetate reverse osmosis (RO) membrane by Loeb and Sourirajan of UCLA in the early 1960s [1], membrane separation technology has come to be used in a many fields of industry. In the 1990s, membrane separation technology gained attention in process water treatment, potable water production, wastewater treatment, and other water treatment applications. Hollow-fiber microfiltration (MF) membranes have become prevalent in the field of water treatment. Advantages over flat-sheet membranes include high mechanical strength and a self-supporting structure to enable back-flushing and greater membrane surface area in a given space. Advantages over ultrafiltration (UF) include higher water permeate flux with a given membrane surface area.",111

Phase separation methods have been classified according to the mechanism of phase separation [2,3]. Three broad categories are evaporation-induced phase separation (EIPS), non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS), and thermally induced phase separation (TIPS). With dry-wet spinning, membrane formation is generally through EIPS, NIPS, or a combination of the two; with melt spinning, it is generally through TIPS.",77
1160,"EIPS, a method whereby solvent evaporates in an air gap (AG) until polymer concentration rises above the dissolution limit, thereby effecting phase separation, is used to produce RO and gas separation membranes as it is well suited to the formation of a very fine porous skin on the membrane surface to function as a separation layer [4,5]. NIPS, a method whereby non-solvent is absorbed in the AG (also called vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) [6]) or polymer solution is immersed in non-solvent to effect phase separation, is generally used to produce UF membranes as it is well suited to the formation of an anisotropic membrane structure to engender high water permeate flux. TIPS, a method whereby phase separation is induced by lowering the temperature of a molten polymer solution, has long been used to produce MF membranes [7-10]. One drawback of hollow-fiber MF membranes produced by melt spinning through TIPS is the tendency for formation of uniform membrane wall morphology, which limits the degree of permeate flux which can be obtained. Fabrication of hollow-fiber MF membranes with anisotropic wall morphology by dry-wet spinning through NIPS has therefore become a focus of research.",191
1161,"Dry-wet spinning through NIPS is commonly used to produce hollow-fiber membranes of polysulfone (PSF) and polyether sulfone (PES). Featuring excellent chemical resistance, heat resistance, and mechanical strength in addition to high permeate flux, these have long been the subject of study for application as separation membranes for RO [11], gas separation [12,13], UF [14], and dialysis [15]. In contrast, despite an extensive search of published literature, we were unable to find reports related to hollow-fiber MF membranes by dry-wet spinning.",80
1162,"There have been a variety of reports related to control of morphology and performance of hollow-fiber membranes of PSF and PES by dry-wet spinning. In the formation of hollow-fiber membranes, there are a greater number of factors in complex interaction than there are in the formation of flat-sheet membranes. These include spinneret size and shape, flow rate of polymer solution and bore liquid, distance and humidity of the AG, and take-up speed.",72
1163,"As with flat-sheet manufacturing, though, dope composition is generally extremely important in hollow-fiber spinning. Due to the inherent chemical resistance of PSF and PES, the choice of solvent is for practical purposes limited to dimethylacetamide (DMAc) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). Experiments to control PSF and PES membrane morphology and performance through modification of dope composition have therefore come to focus on additive species and additive loading.",65
1164,"Many researchers have therefore investigated the effect of additive species and additive loading on PSF or PES hollow-fiber membranes. From the thermodynamic point of view, additives work to bring the dope composition toward the binodal state. From the kinetic point of view, additives act to modulate the interdiffusion rate between solvent and non-solvent by altering dope viscosity. It has long been known that a more porous membrane structure is obtainable with a thermodynamically less stable dope, i.e., one nearer a binodal composition [2,16-18].",83
1165,"To improve gas permeability of gas separation membranes or to increase water permeate flux of UF membranes, low molecular weight (Mw) non-solvents such as water or various alcohols have been used [19-26]. In each case this is because the additive brings the dope composition nearer to the point of phase separation, thereby modulating the speed of demixture of the dope composition in the process of coagulation [2], generally influencing the morphology of the skin layer.",75
1166,"On the other hand, to obtain a nearly sponge-like structure in membrane morphology by suppressing macrovoid formation, to promote pore interconnectivity, and to increase the porosity of a flat-sheet membrane's top surface and support layers, high Mw additives such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) have long been used. In addition to bringing the dope composition nearer to the point of phase separation, high Mw additives modulate the interdiffusion of solvent and non-solvent by raising dope viscosity, which influences not only surface morphology but also the broad macrostructure of the membrane.",92
1167,"Cabasso et al. report that it is possible to obtain MF-class pores on the outer surface of a PSF hollow-fiber membrane when using PVP as additive [27], and Boom et al. report that it is possible to eliminate macrovoids through the addition of PVP to the dope [28]. Torrestiana et al. studied PVP, PEG, and water as additive, reporting that increasing the loading of any of them resulted in greater water permeate flux in PES hollow-fiber UF membranes [29].",79
1168,Liu et al. reported that it is possible to suppress macrovoids and to improve water permeability of a PES hollow-fiber membrane by raising dope viscosity using PEG with Mw of 400Da as additive and bringing the dope composition nearer to the binodal state by adding non-solvent water [30]. They also claimed that it is possible to open MF-class pores on the outer surface by setting the air gap distance to over 10cm.,72
1169,"There have also been many studies on the effect of PVP or PEG additive Mw on the morphology and performance of PSF and PES membranes. Kim and Lee [18] studied the effect of both Mw and additive loading of PEG on PSF flat-sheet membrane formation, and discussed their results from both thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. They indicated that there is a trend toward formation of larger pores when using additive PEG with higher Mw and higher loading.",79
1170,"Xu and Qusay report increasing water permeate flux in PES hollow-fiber UF membranes using the two additives PEG and PVP simultaneously, particularly when PEG Mw was raised to 10,000 [31]. Chakrabarty et al. [32] studied the effect of Mw of PEG additive on PES flat-sheet membrane morphology and performance, and concluded that higher PEG Mw raises water permeability and lowers solute rejection.",62
1171,"In addition to dope composition, many other spinning parameters have been studied to effect control of morphology and performance of PSF and PES hollow-fiber membranes. AG conditions in particular have a strong influence on membrane morphology, especially outer-surface structure [33,34]. Tsai et al. report eliminating voids in PSF hollow-fiber UF membranes by adjusting AG distance and humidity [35]. Similarly, Chung et al. report that it is possible to eliminate voids in PES hollow-fiber UF membranes by increasing AG distance [36].",80
1172,"Liu et al. report outer-surface pore size increasing with greater AG distance in PES hollow-fiber UF membranes using PEG and water as dope additive [37]. Control of inner-surface morphology is generally effected by adjusting the mixture ratio of bore liquids comprising water, a strong non-solvent of PSF and PES, and a solvent such as NMP [26,34]. Yan and Lau report altering NMP and PEG concentrations in bore liquids comprising water and NMP or water, NMP, and PEG as a powerful means of adjusting inner-surface pore size [38].",87
1173,"While some of these studies demonstrate the formation of MF-level pores in PSF or PES hollow-fiber membranes, on the outer surface or within the membrane wall by altering dope composition [27,29], on the outer surface by controlling AG distance and humidity [37], and on the inner surface by using a dope liquid mixture of solvent and non-solvent [38], none of them demonstrate the fabrication of a true MF hollow-fiber membrane from PSF or PES.",74
1174,"To be classed as a hollow-fiber MF membrane, it is necessary that all parts of the membrane, i.e., outer surface, inner surface, and membrane wall, have at least MF-class pores. Obtaining a hollow-fiber MF membrane thus involves a complex combination of spinning conditions, including AG conditions and bore liquid composition, in addition to dope composition using polymeric additive such as PVP or PEG.",63
1175,"Wijman et al. fabricate PSF flat-sheet MF membranes using a three-component PSF/DMAc/PVP cast liquid with an aqueous solution of 89% DMAc as coagulation bath [39]. Zhang et al. fabricate PES flat-sheet MF membranes using a four-component PSF/DMAc/PVP/alcohol cast liquid by employing a certain period of exposure to a 55% RH atmosphere between extrusion and immersion in the coagulation bath [40]. While attempts have been made to adapt such techniques to hollow-fiber MF membrane fabrication from PSF and PES, the complexity of interaction of the more numerous control factors and the need for the membrane to form a self-supporting structure have precluded success [27].",103
1176,"Of note, Ohishi and Ohya [41] disclosed a fabrication technology of PES and PSF hollow-fiber MF membranes by dry-wet spinning. They claimed that PES or PSF hollow-fiber MF membrane with average pore size 0.01-1mm is obtained by using PVP additive with a weight-average Mw of 2900-110,000Da, 95wt.% NMP solution as bore liquid, AG temperature of 45degC, AG humidity of 100% RH, and removal of PVP by decomposition with 2000ppm sodium hypochlorite solution. However, their method is very restrictive and they did not mention the reason why PVP Mw should be in this range. Furthermore, they essentially obtained hollow-fiber MF membrane by removing PVP from the membrane.",106
1177,"We therefore set out to study the formation of PSF hollow-fiber MF membranes by dry-wet spinning based on NIPS. In this study, we selected PEG as polymeric additive and examined how pore size changed with the only variable being PEG Mw, the other conditions of a high-humidity AG and a high-concentration NMP solution as bore liquid being fixed. We discuss the results based on nucleation and growth theory.",68
1178,"The dry-wet spinning process involves the phase separation of a polymer solution into polymer-rich and polymer-lean phases, which can be induced by non-solvent, vapor, or solution. The simplest system comprises three components, polymer/solvent/non-solvent, as described by the ternary phase diagram shown in Fig. 1.",44
1179,"In the metastable regions A and C between the binodal and spinodal curves, the polymer solution separates into a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-lean phase. In these regions, nucleation and growth occur over time. In region A, where the volume of the polymer-rich phase is greater than that of the polymer-lean phase, nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase may initiate the phase separation process. In region C, where the volume of the polymer-lean phase is greater than that of the polymer-rich phase, nucleation of polymer-rich phase may occur. If the polymer composition passes through the critical point where the binodal and spinodal curves meet, a bicontinuous structure forms [2]. Finally, when the concentration of non-solvent exceeds a certain threshold, complete solidification occurs and the structure is fixed, with the polymer-lean phase washing out to leave pores. As shown in Fig. 1, the critical point is generally located at a very low polymer concentration [2]. Therefore, actual membrane formation may occur in regions A or B.",166
1180,"Kim and Lee [18] investigated the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of Mw of PEG additive and additive loading in a PSF/NMP/PEG dope system on the structure formation of PSF flat-sheet membrane. They studied 'precipitation rate' by observing turbidity formation after immersing the transparent film in a non-solvent bath in order to discriminate between the two different 'precipitation types' of 'instantaneous demixing' and 'delayed demixing' described by Mulder [2] and by Reuvers and Smolders [16]. According to the results of Kim and Lee, both an increase in PEG Mw with a given loading and an increase in PEG loading with a given Mw result in a diminished precipitation rate, although the precipitate type of instantaneous demixing remained unchanged. They attributed these results to dope viscosity.",124
1181,"In considering an actual fabrication method of hollow-fiber MF membrane using polymeric additive, Kim and Lee's precipitation rate can be considered to govern the amount of time available for the nucleation and growth of masses of polymer-lean phase within a matrix of polymer-rich phase after phase separation was induced. In this case, the precipitation rate is analogous to the rate at which the polymer-rich phase loses liquidity as the concentration of non-solvent exceeds a certain threshold. 'Coagulation composition' is defined as that in which the concentration of non-solvent is high enough to cause coagulation of the polymer-rich phase. Simply put, a lower precipitation rate provides more time before coagulation composition is reached, enabling nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase to progress further, so that lager pores can form.",129
1182,"Next we consider how to promote nucleation and growth in a practical PSF hollow-fiber spinning process. In industrial spinning processes, water generally is used as coagulation bath. Water is extremely non-solvent for PSF. When the composition of nascent PSF hollow fiber discharged from spinneret enters the bath, coagulation composition is reached in an instant and the structure is fixed.",59
1183,"Phase separation is therefore induced in the AG, and if AG conditions are such that coagulation composition is avoided, and if the nascent hollow fiber has a long residence time in the AG, nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase will progress further before entry into the coagulation bath and larger pores will form. With sufficient residence time in the AG, the diffusion rate of non-solvent becomes slower when dope viscosity is higher, as Kim and Lee point out, which increases the time to reach coagulation composition. Thus nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase is promoted, and lager pores are formed.",102
1184,"In this study, we therefore focused on dope viscosity in determining the optimum dope composition for promotion of nucleation and growth.",21
1185,"Udel P-3500 PSF from Solvay Advanced Polymers with a weight-average Mw of 75,000Da was used as membrane material. Reagent grade NMP from Kishida Chemical was used as polysulfone solvent. PEG grades of differing Mws from Wako and Merck were used as high Mw additive. UF filtrate water was used for both coagulation and flushing baths. A mixture of UF filtrate water and NMP was used as bore liquid.",68
1186,PSF pellets were vacuum dried at 105degC for 20h to remove moisture. NMP and PEG were dissolved at room temperature in a flask until a uniform liquid was obtained. Dried PSF pellets were added to the PEG/NMP solution and mixed at room temperature until evenly dispersed. This dispersion was then raised to 70degC and agitated until the PSF was uniformly dissolved. The polymer solution was then passed through a 0.25mm metal filter and degassed overnight in the dope tank at 70degC and reduced pressure. Dope viscosity was measured at 50degC using a Tokimec DVL-B2 Type B viscometer.,97
1187,"PSF hollow-fiber membranes were produced by the dry-wet spinning process. A schematic diagram of the process is shown in Fig. 2. Spinning dope and bore liquid were driven by gear pump to a hollow-fiber spinneret having 0.4mm i.d. and 1.3mm o.d. The nascent fiber passed through a temperature-controlled air gap which was shrouded by a cylinder before entering the coagulation bath. The fiber was drawn from the coagulation bath to a flushing bath where solvent was removed, and then wound up. Hollow-fiber samples of 30cm length were cut from the wind-up reel and rinsed for 20h in 70degC water.",99
1188,"The five different dope compositions used in this study and their viscosities are shown in Table 1. The basic spinning conditions used are shown in Table 2. Different dope viscosities were obtained by using PEG additives with different Mws in the three-component PSF/NMP/PEG dope. PEG concentration of 30wt.% and NMP concentration of 50wt.% were used in dopes A, B, C, and D; these were changed to 10 and 70wt.%, respectively, for Dope E due the excessively high viscosity causing difficulty mixing had the same concentrations been used with the PEG having Mw of 150,000Da.",94
1189,"AG distance was 400mm, and both AG temperature and coagulation bath temperature were maintained at 80+-1degC. This was the longest AG distance and highest AG temperature available with our experimental apparatus, and these conditions were selected as longer AG distance and higher AG humidity were considered conducive to promotion of nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase [41]. AG temperature control was affected by circulating 80+-1degC water in a jacket around the AG shroud and with the temperature of the coagulation bath water being the same. Bore liquid was 70wt.% NMP solution. We considered high-concentration NMP solution to be preferable for promotion of nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase [41]. However, attempts to use 75wt.% NMP solution were unsuccessful, as nascent hollow fiber would break apart within the AG.",130
1190,"The temperature of both dope and bore liquid were maintained at 50+-1degC. Take-up speed was 10+-1m/min, and the feed rates of dope and bore liquid were adjusted to obtain the desired fiber diameter. Relative humidity in the air gap was measured, and absolute humidity was calculated with Eqs. (1) and (2):(1)E(t)=6.11x107.5t/(t+237.3)(2)A(t)=217xE(t)t+273.3where E(t) is saturated vapor pressure, t is temperature (degC), and A(t) is absolute humidity (g/m3).",66
1191,"Hollow-fiber ID and OD were measured using an optical microscope. Residual PEG concentration was measured by NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Biospin Avance 600 spectrometer, using CDCl3 as solvent. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard for 1H NMR spectra, and the chemical shift was recorded in d values.",54
1192,Tensile strength and tensile elongation at break of the hollow-fiber membranes were measured with a Shimadzu AGS-5D with a crosshead speed of 100mm/min and chuck span of 50mm. Mini-modules of ten strands of hollow-fiber membrane 10cm in length were prepared for the measurement of pure water permeate flux. Deionized water at 25degC was applied at 100kPa in dead-end filtration from inner surface to outer surface. The effective membrane area used for calculation of flux was that of the inner surface.,80
1193,"A Hitachi S-800 scanning electron microscope was used to obtain SEM images for morphological analysis. Samples for cross-section observation were prepared by cryogenic fracture. After immersion in ethanol for approximately 5min, hollow-fiber membranes were immersed in liquid nitrogen and freeze-fractured. Samples for inner surface observation were prepared by cutting hollow-fiber membranes diagonally. All samples were affixed with a conductive adhesive and coated with platinum by sputtering in a vacuum with a Hitachi E-1010. Porosity and average pore size of inner and outer surfaces were calculated on the basis of equivalent diameter using image analysis software (A-Zo Kun, Asahi Kasei Engineering) with the obtained SEM images.",105
1194,"In Fig. 3, dope viscosity is plotted against Mw of additive PEG. Using PEG with Mw of 600Da (PEG600) as additive, dope viscosity was 5.70Pas. Using PEG with Mw of 6000Da (PEG6k) as additive, dope viscosity was 9.13Pas, only a little higher. In contrast, using PEG with Mw of 20,000Da (PEG20k) as additive, dope viscosity was sharply higher at 26.80Pas, and dope viscosity again rose steeply to 43.10Pas when PEG with Mw of 35,000Da (PEG35k) was used as additive.",79
1195,"Clearly, the relationship of rising dope viscosity with higher PEG additive Mw became more pronounced between PEG6k and PEG20k. Finally, when PEG with Mw of 150,000Da (PEG150k) was used as additive, dope viscosity was 53.77Pas; a relatively smaller rise but nonetheless quite high when considering that the PEG concentration in this dope composition was only one third of that in the others. These results imply that dope viscosity was increased by PEG Mw more than by additive loading, as the longer PEG chain length results in stronger entanglement with the PSF chains.",92
1196,"Table 3 shows the names by which the membrane species obtained with each dope composition will be referred to, the flow rates for dope and bore liquid used in order to obtain the desired hollow-fiber ID of 0.65+-0.02mm and o.d. of 1.00+-0.02mm, and the actual diameters obtained. The flow rates of both dope and bore liquid required to obtain the desired diameter become lower with higher dope viscosity, indicating a stronger Barus effect with higher viscosity.",76
1197,"Table 4 shows residual PEG content, tensile elongation at break, and tensile strength at break for the five hollow-fiber species produced. Both tensile elongation at break and tensile strength at break were much higher with PSF150k than with the other species. Residual PEG content was lowest in PSF150k, indicating that residual content is affected by the concentration of PEG additive in the dope. No apparent relationship between residual PEG content and the tensile test results can be ascertained.",78
1198,"In Fig. 4, pure water permeate flux of the obtained hollow-fiber membranes is plotted against Mw of additive PEG. The membrane made with PEG600 had a flux of 160lm-2h-1, and that made with PEG6k had an only slightly higher flux of 185lm-2h-1. Flux of the membrane made with PEG20k jumped sharply to 7700lm-2h-1. With still higher PEG Mw, the rate of increase in flux became quite moderate; fluxes of membranes made with PEG35k and PEG150k were 7800 and 8276lm-2h-1, respectively. As with the dope viscosity relationship, there was a clear inflection between PEG6k and PEG20k, and this inflection was much more pronounced in the case of flux.",107
1199,"Residual PEG content is not considered to have significantly affected flux results: The pattern of residual PEG content, increasing moderately from PSF600 to PSF35k and then decreasing with PSF150k, was quite incongruous with the pattern seen in flux results.",39
1200,"SEM images of cross-sections, outer surfaces, and inner surfaces of hollow-fiber membranes obtained with each dope are shown in Figs. 5-7, respectively. Porosity and mean pore size of the outer surfaces and inner surfaces analyzed from Figs. 6 and 7 are shown in Tables 5 and 6. Only in PSF600 finger-like voids can be seen in the cross-section. The other membranes all display a sponge-like internal structure.",67
1201,"The outer surfaces of all membrane species showed a fine porous structure, with pore size nearly the same in PSF600 and PSF6k, and increasingly larger in PSF20k, PSF35k, and PSF150k. The outer-surface porosity increased significantly between PSF6k and PSF20k.",39
1202,"Regarding the inner surface, both PSF600 and PSF6k had very densely structured surface morphologies, with average pore sizes of 0.125 and 0.141mm, respectively, and both had low porosity. The pore sizes on the inner surface of PSF20k, PSF35k, and PSF150k were apparently larger than those of PSF600 and PSF6k, but the software we used could not analyze the porosity and average pore size for these species apparently due to the irregular, lacerated appearance of the structure. It is nevertheless clear in visual observation of the SEM images that the size of the inner-surface pores were increasingly larger in PSF20k, PSF35k and PSF150k, and that for each of these species the inner-surface pores were larger than the outer-surface pores. We find these observations of the outer-surface and inner-surface structures to be consistent with the water permeability results obtained.",137
1203,"The SEM images also show that PSF150k alone featured a smooth lattice pore structure on the outer surface. We believe that this outer-surface structure imparted considerable mechanical strength, explaining why this fiber's tensile elongation and tensile strength at break were so much higher than those of the other species. This would be consistent with Ohishi and Ohya [41], who disclosed a fabrication method for PSF hollow fiber having a smooth lattice pore structure, claiming that this PSF hollow fiber had higher mechanical strength than hollow fibers without such a structure.",90
1204,"In addition to higher outer-surface pore size with increasing Mw of additive PEG, SEM images show a clear change in pore shape. From PSF600 to PSF35k, pores have a highly irregular structure. This changes dramatically with PSF150k, which has a smooth lattice pore structure.",44
1205,"We consider the mechanism in light of Tsai et al. who carefully investigated the effect of AG relative humidity on the structure of PSF hollow-fiber membrane, particularly in the vicinity of the outer surface [35]. They concluded that penetration of water vapor into the membrane dominated the effect of solvent evaporation during the short period of time when nascent fiber passes through the AG. Especially in case of high boiling point solvent such as NMP (boiling point, 202degC), they found evaporation-induced phase separation to be negligible compared to vapor-induced phase separation.",91
1206,"They also studied mass variation of cast film using polysulfone casting solution under various relative humidities, and found that the mass of cast film increased and that greater increases corresponded to higher relative humidity. In this study, with the AG at 80degC and relative humidity of 100%, absolute humidity was determined to be 292g/m3 using Eqs. (1) and (2). In accordance with Tasi et al. we believe that NIPS occurred in our study due to penetration of water vapor in the AG.",82
1207,"Further valuable insight is found in Lee et al. who studied the water uptake of PSF/NMP binary cast film with different polymer concentrations in an atmosphere of 90% relative humidity [43]. They reported that binary solutions of different polymer concentrations showed similar water uptake behavior, even though the viscosity increased and the diffusion coefficient decreased with higher polymer concentration. In light of Lee et al. we therefore believe that the different dope compositions in this study all had similar water uptake behavior in the AG, despite having different PEG Mws and different viscosities. On the other hand, the interdiffusion coefficient of each dope must decrease as PEG Mw is increased. As mentioned in theory, Kim and Lee reported that the precipitation rate decreased with increased PEG Mw and with increased PEG additive loading, though the precipitation type remains instantaneous demixing in each case. They attributed these phenomena to dope viscosity.",150
1208,"We thus believe that our results can be explained as follows: (a) phase separation of the outer surface of nascent hollow fiber was induced in the AG similarly for each species, although (b) as dope viscosity was raised with higher PEG Mw, there was a greater amount of time between when phase separation was induced and when coagulation composition was reached, i.e., nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase was able to progress further. Outer-surface pore size therefore became larger when dope viscosity was higher.",85
1209,"With regard to the mechanism of formation of the smooth lattice structure on the outer surface of PSF150k, we believe that demixing between PEG and polysulfone in accordance with the long time scale proposed by Boom et al. [28] changed dramatically between PSF35k and PSF150k. In the case of low Mw additive PEG, dope viscosity is low, implying a short time to reach coagulation composition and a low degree nucleation and growth. In case of high Mw additive PEG, dope viscosity is high, implying a long time to reach coagulation composition and high degree of nucleation and growth.",98
1210,"Apparently, in the range of additive PEG600 to PEG35k, the long time scale polymeric additive and polysulfone demixing begin in mid-course of short time scale nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase. Instantaneously, the virtual binodal state shifts toward the real binodal state, causing a jump to the coagulation composition, and structure was fixed. On the other hand, in case of PEG150k, because the PEG chain length is so long, the nucleation and growth of the polymer-lean phase saturates before the beginning of PEG and polysulfone demixing. High Mw PEG then solves out, entering the saturated polymer-lean phase; this serves to expand portions of polymer-lean phase as well as interconnections between them. As a result, a smooth lattice structure as shown in Fig. 6(e) is formed. We thus believe that a smooth lattice structure is formed only when growth of polymer-lean phase has been saturated before polymer demixing begins.",149
1211,"Inner-surface pores of PSF20k, PSF35k, and PSF150k were clearly larger than those of PSF600 and PSF6k, though porosity and average pore size for the three former species could not be analyzed because of the irregular, lacerated appearance of their inner-surface pores.",41
1212,"The fact that nascent hollow fiber would break apart in the 400mm AG when we attempted to use NMP concentration of 75wt.% indicates that a support layer which can withstand the tensile stress of fiber drawing was formed in the vicinity of the inner surface after dope passed through the spinneret only when the water concentration of bore liquid was raised from 25 to 30wt.%. The coagulating power of 70wt.% NMP solution as bore liquid being stronger than water vapor in the AG, non-solvent concentration at the inner surface arrived at coagulation composition sooner than at the outer surface. Thus phase separation at the inner surface stopped progressing and the structure became fixed more quickly than at the outer surface. The average pore sizes for PSF600 and PSF6k on the inner surface were therefore smaller than on the outer surface.",140
1213,"The reason why the average size became larger with higher Mw of additive PEG was as discussed with regard to the outer surface. Dope viscosity increased with higher PEG Mw, so the mutual diffusion rate between non-solvent water and solvent NMP become slower. As a result, the time to reach coagulation composition becomes longer, allowing greater development of the polymer-lean phase.",61
1214,"The irregular shapes and lacerated appearance of inner-surface pores with PSF20k, PSF35k, and PSF150k is believed to be due to a partial ripping and pulling apart of the inner surface under drawing tension. This tension, which was enough to completely break nascent hollow fiber when bore liquid NMP concentration was 75wt.%, apparently caused the inner surface of nascent hollow fiber to partially rip and extend, though the nascent fiber had just enough strength to prevent complete breakage, when bore liquid NMP concentration was 70wt.%. In other words, the structure of the polymer-rich phase in the midst of coagulation was extended by drawing tension. This structural deformation was greater with higher PEG Mw because the formation of the support layer is slower, as higher dope viscosity corresponds to slower mutual diffusion rate between non-solvent water and solvent NMP and a longer time before coagulation composition is reached.",146
1215,"As such irregular inner-surface structures would generally be undesirable in practical MF application, we believe further study regarding control of inner-surface structure is required.",24
1216,"Among the membrane specimens, only PSF600 had finger-like macrovoids in the membrane wall. The other membrane specimens showed a sponge-like structure. The finger-like macrovoids of PSF600 were only observed on the inner-layer side; none were observed on the outer-layer side. It is interesting that no macrovoids formed in PSF6k, despite only a slight difference in average inner-surface pore size, 0.141mm versus 0.125mm with PSF600, and only moderately higher dope viscosity, 9.13Pas versus 5.70Pas with the dope for PSF600. This suggests that a small difference in pore size and/or dope viscosity can affect whether macrovoids form or not.",97
1217,"Fig. 8 shows a segment of the PSF600 membrane wall cross-section at greater magnification. It is clear that the walls of the macrovoids are quite dense in the region of the membrane inner surface, with more and more circular pores forming as they extend toward the middle of the membrane wall.",51
1218,"Based on this observation, we believe the macrovoids were formed not through progression of phase separation, but rather through a process whereby, a dense skin having formed on the inner surface of the nascent membrane, discrete masses of bore liquid are drawn into the nascent membrane wall by osmotic pressure. The process of phase separation and coagulation then initiates at the interface between these masses of bore liquid and the surrounding dope solution, these interfaces eventually forming the walls of the macrovoids. The relatively high water concentration in the region of the inner surface of the membrane results in faster coagulation and macrovoid walls forming as dense skin-like structures. In the region toward the middle of the membrane wall, in contrast, NMP concentration is relatively high, slower coagulation allows the growth of polymer-lean phase to progress, and circular pores form in the macrovoid walls.",144
1219,"Strathmann [44] explains that macrovoids are the result of rapid penetration of non-solvent at certain weak spots in the top of a flat-sheet membrane. Regarding macrovoid growth, Smolders et al. [45] assumed that this occurred due to diffusion between the polymer solution and the macrovoid, with the macrovoid acting as a local coagulation bath. Our results correspond well with their models.",61
1220,"However, if macrovoids are formed by discrete masses of bore liquid, macrovoids may be expected to exist in PSF6k, because the inner-surface pore size differential between PSF600 and PSF6K is only slight. Pore size difference alone, therefore, seems an insufficient explanation. We therefore believe dope viscosity has a critical influence on macrovoid formation. The reason macrovoids formed in PSF600 but not in PSF6k, in spite of their similar inner-surface pore sizes, is believed to be that there is an upper limit to dope viscosity which allows such masses of bore liquid to enter the nascent membrane wall by osmotic pressure, and that the viscosity of Dope B exceeded this limit while that of Dope A did not.",117
1221,"This study examined the formation of PSF hollow-fiber MF membranes by NIPS using a dry-wet spinning process. A three-component dope composition of PSF/NMP/PEG was used with different PEG Mws. The effect of different PEG Mw on dope viscosity, membrane morphology, and membrane performance were examined based on the theory of nucleation and growth.",53
1222,"Dope viscosity rose sharply when PEG Mw was changed from 6000 to 20,000Da: from 9.13 to 26.8Pas The same change of PEG Mw also resulted in a sharp rise in water permeate flux of the membranes obtained, from 185 to 77,000lm-2h-1.",41
1223,"SEM analysis revealed that outer-surface pore size increased with higher PEG Mw and higher dope viscosity. Outer-surface pore structure was irregular with PEG Mw from 600 to 35,000Da, but changed to a smooth lattice structure when PEG Mw was raised to 150,000Da.",42
1224,"Inner-surface pore sizes of PSF20k, PSF35k, and PSF150k were apparently larger than those of PSF600 and PSF6k, though the porosity and mean pore size of the former could not be analyzed because of their irregular, lacerated appearance. The inner-surface pores of PSF20k, PSF35k, and PSF150k were increasingly larger among the three species in this order.",55
1225,Only PSF600 had finger-like macrovoids in the membrane wall. The other membrane specimens showed a sponge-like structure. The macrovoids in PSF600 were only found on the inner-layer side.,28
1226,"The macrovoids are believed to be formed through a process whereby, a dense skin having formed on the inner surface of the nascent membrane, discrete masses of bore liquid are drawn into the nascent membrane wall by osmotic pressure. Our results correspond well with the models of Strathmann [44] and Smolders et al. [45]. Additionally, our results suggest that there is an upper limit to dope viscosity with which such masses of bore liquid are able to thus enter the nascent membrane wall.",83
1227,"We found that it is possible to fabricate a PSF hollow-fiber MF membrane using PEG Mw of 20,000Da or higher, with dope viscosity of 26.8Pas or greater. However, more precise control of both inner-surface and outer-surface pore structure is required in order to obtain a practical MF membrane having a filter layer in the region of the outer surface and gradually increasing pore size across the thickness of the membrane wall toward the inner surface.",75
1228,"Polymer membranes have been widely used in a number of important separation technologies including the removal of macromolecules, organic pollutants, bacteria, viruses, salts, and gas molecules from various kinds of feed streams [1-4]. However, significant decline of water flux has been observed in the separation systems based on polymer membranes because organic pollutants and microorganisms in the feed stream can easily deposit onto the surface of the membranes and/or in their pore walls that are composed of organic moieties [5,6]. Furthermore, the growth and colonization of bacteria on the membrane surface degenerate the comprehensive performances of the membranes during the operation. Therefore, a number of approaches to prepare antifouling and/or antimicrobial membranes have been studied to minimize the decrease of the membrane performance [7-9]. It was found that hydrophilic polymers coated on the membrane surface can alleviate fouling because the hydrophilic groups can attenuate the interaction between the membrane and foulants [10-12]. Therefore, the introduction of various hydrophilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) [7-9,13], poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) [14,15], polyglycerol (PG) [16], and polydopamine (PDA) [17], have been introduced into the polymer structure to improve the membrane performance by decreasing the membrane fouling.",193
1229,"The polysulfone-based ultrafiltration (UF) membranes having antifouling and antimicrobial properties were prepared by two steps: (1) introducing PDA moiety for the antifouling property through an in situ process [26-30], and (2) immobilizing nisin as an antimicrobial peptide through a post-treatment [20]. The surface properties, fouling resistance, and antimicrobial properties of the membranes containing PDA and nisin moieties were investigated, and compared to those of the bare polysulfone (PSf) membrane.",69
1230,"Allyl polysulfone (APSf) was synthesized by the condensation polymerization of DBPA with DFDPS as shown in Scheme 1[23,32]. A 250 mL three-neck round bottom flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, a Dean-Stark trap, and nitrogen inlet and outlet was charged with DBPA (3.08 g, 10 mmol), DFDPS (2.54 g, 10 mmol), K2CO3 (1.52 g, 11 mmol), and hydroquinone (0.001 g, 0.01 mmol) in 8 mL of NMP. Then, 4 mL of toluene (NMP/toluene = 2/1 v/v) was added as an azeotropic agent. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 140 degC for 6 h to dehydrate the reaction mixture. After toluene was removed at 150 degC for 2 h, this temperature was maintained for the polymerization. During the polymerization, the reaction mixture turned to a viscous brown solution. The viscous solution cooled to room temperature after 16 h of the reaction and then was diluted with 10 mL of NMP. APSf was obtained by precipitating the solution into isopropyl alcohol, followed by alternately washing with DI water and isopropyl alcohol for several times to completely remove the residual salts and solvent.

1235,"Allyl polysulfone (APSf) was synthesized via the condensation polymerization of the dihydroxy monomer, 2,2'-diallylbisphenol A (DBPA), with the dihalo monomer, 4,4'-difluorodiphenyl sulfone (DFDPS). DBPA was intentionally used because the allyl group can go through the radical polymerization with dopamine methacrylamide (DMA) to introduce the dopamine moiety in the membrane by the grafting-through approach (Fig. S1). A small amount of hydroquinone was added into the reaction mixture in order to prevent the unintended isomerization of allyl groups in DBPA [13]. Fig. 1 shows 1H NMR spectra and the assignment of the respective peaks of APSf. The proton peaks from the allyl groups (d = 3.23 and 4.95 ppm) indicate that the isomerization of the allyl group into the propenyl group was efficiently inhibited. When the polymerization of APSf was performed without the presence of hydroquinone, a number of uncharacterized peaks were observed due to the formation of partial propenyl groups (Fig. S2) [13,32].",152
1236,"Table 1 shows that the weight ratio of APSf to DMA was varied from 1: 0.6, 1:0.8, to 1:1 for the preparation of the membranes named as AP-DM0.6, AP-DM0.8, and AP-DM1 membranes, respectively. PDMA homopolymer and residual DMA monomer were removed by immersing the membrane in NaOH solution [32]. ATR-IR spectra of the AP-DM# membranes exhibit the characteristic peaks from PSf and APSf at 2968, 1584, 1502, and 1487 cm-1, corresponding to the aromatic -C-H and -C-C stretchings of PSf and APSf (Fig. 2). Comparing APSf with AP-DM# membranes, the CC stretching peak of allyl group at 1685 cm-1 disappeared after the polymerization, whereas the peaks at 2849 cm-1 (CC stretch) and 1659 cm-1 (CO stretch) are newly observed in the spectra of AP-DM# membranes verifying the incorporation of PDMA moiety.",131
1237,"The immobilization of the nisin into the membranes was found to decrease the average pore diameter as reported by others [43]; the average pore diameters of AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes are always smaller than those of the corresponding AP-DM# membranes, and those of AP-DM#-N5 membranes are also smaller than those of AP-DM#-N1 membranes when they were prepared using the same amount of DMA. Still pores of the AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes are not clogged by nisin immobilization as shown in their SEM images (Fig. 5) because the concentration of nisin solution is quite small. In addition, the surface and cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the membranes also exhibit that all the membranes have the same asymmetric structure composed of a dense top layer and a porous sublayer. Therefore, reasonably high pure water flux values for the AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes could be obtained as listed in Table 2.",147
1238,"It is well-known that the hydrophilicity of membrane surface can increase the antifouling property [5,6]. The hydrophilicity of the membranes could be estimated by measuring air captive bubble contact angles on the membranes equilibrated in DI water. The contact angle values of the AP-DM# membranes containing hydrophilic PDMA moiety are smaller than that of the PSf membrane and they further decrease as the content of PDMA moiety increases (Fig. 6(a)). The immobilization of nisin on AP-DM-# membrane can decrease the hydrophilicity because nisin is less hydrophilic than DMA. Therefore, as the concentration of nisin solution increases, the contact angle increases (Fig. S6). Still, the contact angle values of all AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes are smaller than that of the PSf membrane as confirmed in Fig. 6(b) because all AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes are more hydrophilic than the PSf membrane [17,44].",140
1239,"The further studies on dead-end filtration and antimicrobial tests were performed using a series of AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes, while the AP-DM# membranes were not tested, although the AP-DM# membranes have larger water permeability values than AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes. The objective of this study is to develop multifunctional UF membrane having both antifouling property and antimicrobial activity, while the bacterial inhibition rate of AP-DM# membranes without any antimicrobial nisin moiety is much lower than those of AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes as shown in Fig. S7.",86
1240,"The protein (BSA) rejection behavior of the membranes is summarized in Fig. 8(b). Although the AP-DM1-N1 and AP-DM1-N5 membranes exhibit low BSA rejection (smaller than 60%), most of the membranes used in this study, such as AP-DM0.6-N1, AP-DM0.6-N5, AP-DM0.8-N1, and AP-DM0.8-N5 show high BSA rejection values larger than 92%. Therefore, it can be reasonably speculated that the AP-DM#-N1 and AP-DM#-N5 membranes have the excellent membrane performance to be used as the UF membrane that exhibits reasonably high water flux, noticeable fouling resistance, and high protein rejection, except for the AP-DM1-N1 and AP-DM1-N5 membranes. The lower protein rejection behavior of the AP-DM1-N1 and AP-DM1-N5 membranes is possibly due to the large content of free PDMA chains as reported by others before [40].",121
1241,"Polysulfone based ultrafiltration (UF) membranes prepared with ally polysulfone (APSf) containing optimum amount of mussel-inspired poly(dopamine methacrylamide) (PDMA) and antimicrobial nisin moieties exhibited noticeably enhanced fouling resistances, flux recovery ability, and high bactericidal properties, compared with the bare polysulfone membrane. This could be ascribed to the hydrophilic PDMA moiety having the antifouling property against biofoluant and the covalently bonded nisin moiety having the antibacterial property against Gram-positive bacteria. We believe that the membrane performance results obtained from these multifunctional membranes can provide a better understanding for the development of multifunctional UF membranes, which can overcome the limitation of existing membrane filtration technology by synergistically combining the antifouling and antibacterial properties.",110

1245,"One of the phase separation techniques widely used in membrane fabrication is thermally induced phase separation (TIPS). The TIPS method is typically applied to fabricate membranes made from semi-crystalline polymers in which temperature control plays a pivotal role in removing thermal energy in a hot dope solution. It has been well established that the membranes fabricated via the TIPS method have fewer defects and more reproducible in a laboratory and at industrial scale [10,11]. Additionally, temperature elevation in the TIPS method allows for a wide selection of polymer and compatible solvent in making membranes. One downside of this method is higher energy consumption. The cooling rate of the casting solution and temperature of crystallization play an essential role in determining the final morphological structure of the membranes [12,13]. The membrane qualities resulting from this method include high porosity, tunable pore size and structure, asymmetry, high mechanical strength, and many more.",150
1246,"Semi-crystalline polymers such as polysulfone (PSF) are commonly used to make UF membranes by TIPS. It has high mechanical stability, glass transition temperature, and hydrophobicity [14-16]. Porous membranes such as UF can be modified by surface coating to produce thin-film composite (TFC) membranes. The TFC membranes have become popular in water treatment research over the years. The strategies used to prepare these membranes include interfacial polymerization (IP) and dip-coating to mention just a couple. These strategies have shown tremendous achievements in producing membranes with improved performance.",86
1247,"The porous support UF membranes (PSF/SMA) were prepared by the TIPS method at different concentrations of SMA. The PSF polymer was purchased from Dalian Polysulfone Plastic Company Ltd. (Liaoning province, China), and SMA was procured from Solvay Solexis Co. Ltd. (Belgium). DPGDB, which acts as a diluent with molecular weight 342.4 g/mole, was sourced from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company Limited.

Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was purchased from the Institute of Haematology, Chinese academic medical science (Tianjin province of China). Ethanol (purity > 99 %) was used to extract DPGDB. b-CD (96 % purity) with molecular weight 1134.98 g/mole was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation in Shanghai, China. Cyclohexane (99.7 % purity), TEA, and TMC were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company Ltd.",143
1248,"The polymer membranes were prepared by TIPS. In the first step, PSF and SMA were dried in the oven for 24 h at 800C to remove moisture. The weight ratio for PSF was kept constant at 21 % wt. while varying SMA/DPGDB at 0/79, 3/76, 6/73, and 9/70. The membrane samples were denoted by the letters: S0, S1, S2, and S3 at different SMA and DPGDB concentrations, respectively, as shown in Table 1",73
1249,"The PSF/SMA and DPGDB (the diluent) were blended and heated at temperature range of 160-166 degC while stirring for about 4 h to obtain the homogeneous casting solution. Under low pressure, the homogeneous hot solution was de-aerated to allow the complete release of air bubbles. Then the casting solution was spread on a hot stainless steel plate (temperature 160 degC) by a casting bar having a gap of 200 mm. Thereafter, the plate was cooled in a water bath at room temperature (25 degC) until the flat membrane formed. The membrane formation process was completed by transferring the film into an ethanol bath for extraction of the diluent for 48 h. The membranes were then kept in deionized water until further use.",122

The different b-CD concentrations were; 0 %, 2.0 %, 4.0 %, 6.0 % and 8.0 % wt/v. The membranes were named as M0 to M4 with respect to the b-CD concentrations. The pH of the solution was fixed at 11 in order to achieve a stable network of b-CD/TMC using NaOH and Na2CO3. Next, a solution of the organic phase was prepared by dissolving TMC 0.5 % wt/v in cyclohexane. The schematic diagram summarizing the surface modification process is shown in Fig. 1.",110
1251,"The PSF/SMA support membrane was first saturated with the TMC solution for 30 min, by placing the upper part of the membrane on the glass plate. To ensure that only the top surface was exposed to the coating solution, the membrane was clamped inside a glass tube. Thereafter, the b-CD solution was poured into the glass tube. It was allowed to stand overnight to achieve maximum crosslinking. Finally, the modified PSF/SMA membrane was washed with deionized water and dried in an oven at 60 degC for 40 min to complete the cross-linking process (Fig. 2).",95

1260,The antifouling performance of the PSF/SMA blend membranes compared to the pristine PSF membrane was investigated using BSA as the model foulant. The method has been reported to be acceptable for obtaining pure water flux recovery [22]. Fouling procedure used in this study involved four main stages as follows: (1) water flux filtration at the operating pressure of 0.15 MPa; (2) fouling stage with the feed solution of 1 g/L BSA for 1 h; (3) Cleaning or backwash with pure water for 1 h at 0.15 MPa; and (4) the 2nd pure water filtration to record the flux and calculate the water flux recovery (FRR) so as to estimate the antifouling efficiency of the membranes by Eq. (3)(3)FRR%=Jw2Jw1x100%where Jw1 is the initial PWF; Jw2 is the PWF obtained after the membrane cleaning.,132
1261,"The cross-section morphology of the membranes was studied using SEM technique. The results for unmodified membranes are presented in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the membranes exhibit a spongy-like morphology. This type of morphology can be attributed to the TIPS method, which was used for membrane fabrication. In this method, the rate of liquid-solid phase separation governs membrane pore formation.",62
1262,"A similar kind of structure was also reported for the polyethersulfone/sulfonated polysulfone UF membranes with ultra-low graphene-oxide loading, where the presence of cellular voids from the spongy-like structure was observed [23]. On further addition of SMA to pristine PSF, the size of nano-voids increases without necessarily compromising the pore density at the concentration used. The increase in SMA concentration is expected to affect the mobility of the PSF molecule, whereby delaying the phase inversion process [24,25]. Unlike in membranes fabricated by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) [26,27], it is interesting that the results in Fig. 3 do not show any thin layer at the top surface.",106
1263,"In order to achieve the characteristics of the tight UF membrane, a thin layer was deposited on the surface of membrane S1. The cross-section morphology of the surface-modified membranes is presented in Fig. 4. The thickness of the top-layer ranged from 8 mm to 18 mm. Obviously, the presence of the top layer signifies the presence of the coating layer. In short, this is evidence that the surface modification (dip-coating) was successful.",72
1264,"Looking at the from the membrane M0, it can be seen that there is no top layer because the membrane was not subjected to surface modification. On the other hand, the coated membranes exhibit a thin surface layer, which increases in thickness with an increase in the concentration of the coating solution. In that regard, M1 has a top layer of 8 mm thickness because the concentration of b-CD was 2 % wt/v, whereas M4 had a layer thickness of 18 mm where the concentration of b-CD was 8 % wt/v. Evidently, the increase in concentration affects the thickness of the layer, which suggests that M4 may perform better as a tight UF membrane. The effect of solution concentration on the dip-coated layer was also reported by Dlamini et al. [28] and Hong et al. [29]. In another study, it was also reported that the increase in polyvinyl alcohol in concentration resulted in a thicker coating layer [30].",158
1265,"The surface roughness of the tight UF membranes was studied. This was done to ascertain the effect of casting solution concentration on the roughness. This was necessitated by the fact that membrane roughness is one of the important properties that can affect membrane performance in water treatment. For instance, it is well established that rougher membranes are more susceptible to fouling. Additionally, it was argued in a critical review by Dlamini et al. that surface roughness may affect or influence water permeate flux [31,32]. Therefore, the topology results are presented in Fig. 5, and tabulated results are summarized in Table 2",101
1266,"The average surface roughness is denoted by Ra, and the root means square roughness is indicated by Rq. It can be clearly seen that the surface roughness of M0 is lower compared to the coated membranes. The average roughness from the uncoated surface membrane to the coated PSF/SMA membrane is seen from 11 nm to 25.2 nm. See Table 2",60
1267,"Therefore, this indicates that the increase in coating solution concentration increases surface roughness.",13
1268,"Generally, it is expected that surface roughness should decrease after dip-coating because the coating solution would fill up the valleys. Therefore, in that case, the increase in concentration should ideally result in a smoother surface. This should be so because the thickness of the layer generally increases with the concentration. Other researchers have investigated the modification of the MF membrane by coating with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), where it was reported that the surface roughness decreased with an increase in coating solution concentration [33]. Our observation in the present study was an augmentation in roughness at higher concentrations. Fortunately, there are other studies where similar observations were reported [34-36]. In the case of our study, this observation can be explained by the bulkiness of the b-CD. Additionally, the size of the b-CD molecule should increase in the event of hypothesized chemically interacted with other components during casting solution preparation.",147
1269,"In order to further confirm the physical observations, the pore size for each modified membrane obtained by POROLUX 1000 is presented in Table 3. The b-CD concentration change contributes to the change of pore distribution across the surface of the membrane. It is observed that all membranes have a narrow mean flow pore size range > 10 nm and < 35 nm.",62
1270,"It was observed that membrane M0 (unmodified), has the highest porosity and the largest surface pore occurred at the first bubble point, which was found to be 34.2 nm mean flow, and the pore size was 42.9 nm. The smallest pore size was achieved by higher b-CD concentration membrane M4 which was 13.2 nm. Unmodified PSF/SMA membrane has a larger average surface pore size as well as more porous membrane compared to the modified membrane, and this is also confirmed from Fig. 6.",83
1271,"The presence of the coating layer on the surface of the UF membrane was also verified by elemental analysis technique. Basically, FTIR was used to identify the characteristic peaks, especially those confirming TMC/ b-CD presence. In addition, XPS was used for elemental quantification. These techniques are discussed below.",48
1272,The aim of performing this analysis is to identify functional groups that are present in the modified membranes. Different FTIR absorption bands of the PSF/SMA coated membranes were studied. From Fig. 7 shows the characteristic peaks at different wavelength ranges (500-3500 cm-1).,42
1273,"The results for the uncoated membrane are not presented because there was not much difference because of SMA characteristic peaks. From Fig. 7, it can be shown that the peak for CC was observed at a wavelength of 875 cm-1, which is a major functional group of the modified membrane material. In addition to that, a peak characteristic to OH group vibrations is observed at a wavelength between 2700 cm-1 and 3600 cm-1. At a high concentration of b-CD, the OH absorption peak appears with a higher intensity, which should be expected because this group is dominant in the molecule. This result may be used to support the conclusion that a stable layer was successfully deposited. The presence of the two peaks characteristic to COC at wavelengths 1200 cm-1 and 1050 cm-1 suggests the presence of aromatic ether which is present in the b-CD/TMC layer [38,39]. This is another proof of successful surface modification.",154
1274,"Herein, XPS was used to determine and quantify elements such as Carbon and Oxygen. The results are presented in Fig. 8. The results show four peaks that were assigned to COOH, C-O-C/C-OH, C-N/CH2, and C-H/C-C. The binding energy for these peaks are: 288.5 e.V (COOH), 286.5 e.V (C-O-C/C-OH), 286 e.V (C-N/CH2) and 284.5 e.V (C-C/C-H) [37,40].",56
1275,The chemical composition is tabulated in Table 4.,8
1276,"The presence of C-O-C/C-OH at the binding energy 286.5 e.V underscores the successful surface deposition of b-CD and TMC [37,41]. This peak can be seen in the results of all the membranes. The area under the peak increases with an increase of b-CD concentration, as can be confirmed by the increase in atomic oxygen percentage.",55
1277,"Water contact angle predicts the membrane surface hydrophilicity. Generally, higher membrane hydrophilicity indicates, lower water contact angle degree [42,43]. Water contact angle results are shown in Fig. 9.",28
1278,"As presented in Fig. 9 and Table 3, the water contact angle decreased with the increase b-CD concentration from O = 79.8deg to O = 55.9deg. This suggests that the addition of b-CD from 2 % wt/v to 8 % wt/v in the aqueous concentration improves the hydrophilicity of the membrane. This is so because at higher concentration of b-CD there are more OH group available to interact with the water droplet. Low contact angle values suggest higher interaction between water molecules with the membrane due to exterior surface of b-CD (hydrophilic) and a hydroxyl group, which are water-loving functional groups [44,45].",102
1279,"The effect of increasing SMA concentration on the performance of PSF/SMA UF membranes was investigated. Furthermore, the effect of increasing b-CD concentration on the performance of the tight UF membrane was interrogated. The performance was investigated in terms of PWF and solute rejection. The PWF results are presented in Fig. 10. The PWF of pristine PSF (S0) was observed at 47 Lm-2 h-1. After the addition of 3 % wt/wt of SMA, PWF increased to 127 Lm-2 h-1 for S1. On the further SMA concentration increment to 6 % wt/wt and 9 % wt/wt the PWF brought down to 86 Lm-2 h-1 and 51 Lm-2 h-1, respectively. The flux decline from S1 to S3 can be explained by two reasons: (1) Over cross-linking, (2) overall membrane thickness increase as a result of SMA addition. The over cross-linking emanates from intensive chemical and/or physical interaction between PSF and SMA at a higher SMA loading rate.",154
1280,"The tight UF membranes were prepared by a surface coating of S1. The PWF of the first modified membrane (M1) was observed at 111 Lm-2 h-1 when b-CD concentration was at 2 % wt/v. After the addition of 4 % wt/v of b-CD, the PWF dropped to 80 Lm-2 h-1 for M2. Upon further b-CD concentration loading to 6 % wt/wt and 8 % wt/v the PWF declined to 66 Lm-2 h-1 and 40 Lm-2 h-1 for M3 and M4, respectively. This flux decline from M1 to M4 was attributed to the increase in the thickness of the dip-coating layer at the surface of the membrane [46,47].",107
1281,The membranes were tested for efficiency for the removal of organic pollutants from water. The model pollutant used were BSA and Congo red dye. The rejection of BSA is presented in Fig. 11 alongside with pure water permeability.,38
1282,"As a consequence of over cross-linking and increasing membrane thickness, the rejection increased from S0 to S3. The BSA rejection results were as follows; (S0) was 80 %, S1 was 83 %, S2 was 87 %, and S3 was 93 %. A similar trend was reported in the literature where BSA rejection was seen to increase where the polyether sulfone (PES) blended with cellulose acetate (CA) by inclusion of silver oxide (Ag2O) nanoparticles towards UF membrane [48]. Other researchers have reported that the BSA rejection is mainly affected by the average membrane pore size, and higher BSA rejection is contributed by the smaller pore size, for the case of membrane fabrication of PES/cellulose nanocrystals blended membranes have shown a similar trend to the present study [49].",126
1283,"The BSA rejection of the first modified membrane (M1) was observed at 85 % when b-CD concentration was at 2 % wt/v. After the addition of 4 % wt/v of b-CD, the BSA rejection increased to 88 % for M2. Upon further b-CD concentration loading to 6 % wt/wt and 8 % wt/v, this BSA rejection increased to 91 % and 94 % for M3 and M4, respectively. The rejection increase can be attributed to the increase in the thickness of the dip-coating layer, a consequence that resulted in a longer diffusion path length. The BSA transport in the hydrophilic layer is expected to be governed by both pore flow and solution diffusion mechanisms. Even though there are no actual pores in the layer, the inter-molecular spacing, especially expected in M1, should act as pores. On the other hand, solution diffusion should dominate in the tighter membranes (M3 and M4). The same argument can be made for Congo red transport. The results for Congo red rejection are shown in Fig. 12.",171
1284,"It is seen that the unmodified PSF/SMA membrane has lower than 50 % dye rejection, which is because the pore size of the membrane is significant as it is considered to be in the UF range. Therefore it would allow the dissolved dye to pass through the membrane. It was reported that due to low dye molecular size, some UF membranes have been reported to show such low dye rejection [50,51]. On the other hand, the tight UF membranes in Fig. 12 show much-improved dye rejection. This is evidence that, the surface modification was successful. Another observation made was the increase in dye rejection with the increase in the concentration of b-CD. To concisely summarize the results, the lowest rejection was 10 %, which was attained by the uncoated pristine PSF membrane. The maximum Congo red dye rejection achieved by M4 is 96 %.",144
1285,"The protein, BSA, is one of the problematic pollutants in water that tend to foul a membrane. The antifouling performance of the membranes was estimated from the water-flux recovery ratio (FRR) after BSA rejection kinetics. The results are presented in Fig. 13.",42
1286,"The higher the flux recovery ratio, the excellent antifouling performance of the membrane. The water flux recovery ratio was highest at 94 %, and b-CD concentration was 6-8 % wt/v. It was 77 % for the pristine PSF membrane. This indicates that the BSA foulant was easily washed away from the surface of the membrane containing 6-8 % wt/v b-CD. Basically, the antifouling performance is higher at higher SMA content.",70
1287,"In order to observe the change in surface charge of the tight UF membranes, tzeta potential test was conducted for the selected membranes M0, M2 and M4. The results are shown in Fig. 14.",34
1288,"It was observed that at a higher b-CD concentration and pH of 7.0, the charge of the membrane (M4) was -34.7, while M2 and M0 exhibit the surface charge of -26, and -19 respectively. The higher surface charge is attributed to presence of free hydroxyl group (-OH) of an oligosaccharide (b-CD) from aqueous solution [52]. Interestingly at all the pH values all the membranes exhibit negative charge. Furthermore, the increase in b-CD on the surface coating, makes the membrane more negative. Therefore the increase of pH contributes to the more negative charge of the membrane, and this is due to the presence of higher b-CD concentration on the surface. The membrane with high negative charges can repel anions and attract cations, and this is also one of the reason that resulted in high rejection of the Congo red dye.",139
1289,"Tight UF membranes were successfully prepared by surface deposition of TMC and b-CD layer on the surface of the PSF/SMA UF membrane by dip-coating. The coating layer was stabilized by intermolecular crosslinking between TMC and b-CD under basic pH conditions. The effects of b-CD on the separation performance, structure, and morphology of the flat-sheet PSF/SMA membrane were successfully investigated. The spongy morphology of the UF support membrane was deemed suitable for this process and the diffusion of casting solution into the support membrane went smooth. The presence of the coating-layer was confirmed through SEM cross-section morphology and elemental analysis using FTIR and XPS. The effect of increasing b-CD concentration on membrane performance was investigated. It was found that pure water permeability decreases with an increase of b-CD concentration. On the other hand, BSA and Congo red rejection varied showing directly proportional relationship to the increase of b-CD concentration. The water contact-angle was found to decrease with an increase in b-CD concentration, an indication that the tight UF membrane becomes high hydrophilic.",171

1293,"In recent years, polysulfone (PSf) membrane has been widely applied in biotechnological applications, such as hemodiafiltration and protein separation, due to its excellent mechanical strength, chemical resistance, chemical and thermal durability [1-3]. However, the antifouling and hemocompatibility of the hydrophobic PSf membrane are not ideal [4-6]. Membrane fouling is often initiated by the accumulation/aggregation of suspended solids, colloidal particles and biomolecules on the surfaces and pores of the separation membranes, resulting in an increase in resistance to permeate flow [7,8]. In addition, the adsorption and deposition of proteins and platelets often cause thrombus formation and blood coagulation [9]. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the antifouling and hemocompatibility of PSf membrane applied in hemodiafiltration.",114
1294,"Hydrophilic modification is an effective and conventional method to enhance antifouling and hemocompatibility of the polymeric membranes. A water layer formed on the hydrophilic surface can inhibit the adsorption and adhesion of pollutants, proteins and platelets via repulsive hydration force, thus reducing fouling and improving hemocompatibility [10-13]. Extensive hydrophilic polymers and anticoagulants, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and polyzwitterions, have been implemented to improve the fouling and hemocompatibility of the hydrophobic polymeric membrane [4,14-20]. PVP, a non-ionic water soluble polymer, has received much attention due to its good chemical stability, physiological inertness and biocompatibility [21,22]. It was initially used as a blood plasma substitute. Up to date, PVP has been employed as a hydrophilic agent to modify polymeric membranes.",122
1295,"Blending, surface coating and grafting methods have been reported to modify polymeric membranes [23-26]. Compared to other approaches, blending is an easier and more convenient method to improve the membrane surface and internal pore walls [27]. However, the elution of PVP from the blend membranes is almost unavoidable, leading to deterioration in long-term durability [28,29]. In order to avoid the elution of PVP, PVP-based amphiphilic copolymers, such as poly(styrene-acrylic acid-vinylpyrrolidone) (P(St-AA-VP)) [30], PVP-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-PVP (PVP-b-PMMA-b-PVP) [22,31-34], PVP-b-poly(acrylate-g-poly(methyl methacrylate))-b-PVP (PVP-b-P(AE-g-PMMA)-b-PVP) [28], poly(styrene-acrylic acid)-b-PVP-b-poly(styrene-acrylic acid) (P(St-AA)-b-PVP-b-P(St-AA)) [35], were synthesized and developed as the blend additives. In the amphiphilic copolymers, the hydrophilic PVP chains migrate to the membrane surface during the phase separation process to prevent the adsorption and adhesion of proteins and platelets, meanwhile, the hydrophobic chains mingle in the membrane bulk materials. As a result, the blend membranes with amphiphilic copolymers as additive exhibited enhanced antifouling and good hemocompatibility properties and long-term durability. However, the synthesis and purification of the amphiphilic copolymers often require multi-step procedures, increasing membrane fabrication costs and limiting their practical application. Therefore, it should be to simplify the modification procedure and to improve the utilization efficiency.",189
1296,"The in situ polymerization is an easy and effective method for the modification of polymeric membranes. Zhang et al. synthesized poly(polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether methyl methacrylate-methyl methacrylate) (P(PEGMA-MMA)) and poly(polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether methyl methacrylate-polytetrahydrofuran dimethacrylate ester) (P(PEGMA-PTMGDA)) in the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) solutions via free radical polymerization to modify PVDF membranes with superior mechanical behaviors, enhanced antifouling properties, narrowly distributed pore size and molecular weight cut off [36,37]. However, the stability of the modified membranes might be insufficient, because crosslinking agent was not added in the polymerization. As a result, the in situ cross-linked polymerization was developed and has been used to modify polyethersulfone (PES) membranes [38-40]. Compared with the conventional blending, the in situ cross-linked polymerization approach improves the modification efficiency, avoids post-synthetic treatments and reduces the overall costs.",131
1297,"In this study, we aim to enhance the anti-fouling and hemocompatibility properties of PSf membranes through in situ cross-linked polymerization. Generally, VP and vinyltriethoxysilane (VTEOS) were polymerized and cross-linked in PSf solutions. After being vacuum degassed, the obtained solution was directly used to fabricate membranes via non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique. The morphology, surface chemistry and hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes were investigated in detail. The ultrafiltration experiments for pure water and bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution were applied to characterize the fouling resistance property. In addition, BSA adsorption, platelet adhesion and morphology, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and the content of fibrinogen (FIB) transferring to fibrin were measured to detect the hemocompatibility of the obtained membranes.",121
1298,"Polysulfone (PSf, S6010) was bought from BASF SE. Vinyltriethoxysilane (VTEOS), N-vinyl pyrrolidone (VP), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (Lyz) were purchased from Aladdin, China. VTEOS and VP were purified with basic alumina and activated carbon before use, respectively. AIBN was recrystallized from ethanol. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were supplied by the Blood Center of Ningbo, China. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), Prothrombin time (PT) and The content of fibrinogen (FIB) transferring to fibrin reagent kits were purchased from Shanghai Sun Biotech Co., Ltd., China. All other regents, such as N,N'-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and ethanol, were brought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China.",108
1299,"Membrane morphologies were obtained with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Before the observation, the samples were sputtered with platinum. The composition of the membrane surfaces was characterized by X ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Shimadzu Axis Utltradld, Japan) with a take-off angle of 45degand attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Thermo-Nicolet 6700,US) between 4000 and 650cm-1. Zeta potential (z) of the membranes was measured by a SurPASS (Anton Paar GmbH, Austria) electrokinetic analyzer (1mmol/L KCl solution, 25degC). Pore size of the obtained PSf membranes was detected by a liquid-liquid porometer (LLP-1200A, Porous Materials Inc. US). Porosity of the obtained membranes was characterized by the liquid displacement method [41]. Briefly, a dry membrane sample was immersed into 1-butanol for 30min and weighted after whipping off excess surface liquid. Then porosity of the sample was calculated using Eq. (1).(1)porosity=mwet-mdry/rmwet-mdry/r+mdry/rPSfx100%where mdry (g) and mwet (g) are the weight of a membrane sample before and after immersing into 1-butanol. r (g/cm3) and rPSf (g/cm3) are the density of 1-butanol and PSf, respectively.",173
1300,"The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membranes was characterized by a contact angle measurement (OCA20, Dataphysics, Germany) under the sessile mode. In a typical procedure, a deionized water droplet (1mL) was dropped onto a membrane sample (1.0x5.0cm2) attached on a glass slide. The water contact angle varying with time was auto calculated and recorded by the software of the equipment. At least five measurement results were averaged to obtain a reliable value.",70
1301,"In order to evaluate the antifouling ability of the membranes, flux recovery ratio (FRRprotein, %) was defined and calculated by the following Eq. (4). All given data were averaged from three different measurements.(4)FRRprotein=JwrJwx100%",33
1302,"Typically, a membrane sample was first wetted in physiological saline, then immersed into BSA solution (10mL, 1mg/mL in PBS buffer solution, pH7.4) or Lyz solution (0.3mg/mL in PBS buffer solution, pH7.4) at 37degC for 6h under stirring to reach the adsorption equilibrium. The sample was carefully rinsed with PBS buffer solution (pH7.4) to remove unstable protein. The amount of adsorbed protein (Aprotein, mg/cm2) on membrane sample was calculated by the following Eq. (5).(5)Aprotein=CbeforeVbefore-CafterVafterSwhere Cbefore (mg/mL) and Cafter (mg/mL) represent the protein concentration before and after treating with membrane sample, Vbefore (mL) and Vafter (mL) represent the volume of protein solution before and after treating with membrane sample, S (12.5cm2) is the membrane sample area. The given value was averaged from three different measurements.",123
1303,"Typically, a round membrane sample (d=1cm) was immersed in physiological saline 37degC for 2h. Then the physiological saline was switched to 100mL platelet-rich plasma (PRP) at 37degC. After 1h, the PRP was removed, and the membrane was washed with physiological saline and immersed into 5wt% glutaraldehyde solution for at 4degC for 12h. Finally, the sample was washed with ultrapure water and dehydrated using a serial of graded ethanol/water solutions (10, 30, 50, 70, 90 and 100wt%, respectively). The dried membranes were observed with SEM (Hitachi S-4800, Japan) after sputtering a platinum layer.",92
1304,"A membrane sample (1.0x1.0cm2) was equilibrated in physiological saline at 37degC for 1h. Then the sample was taken out and put into a test cup. Subsequently, fresh PPP (100mL) was added, followed by the addition of APTT agent (100mL, 37degC). After incubating at 37degC for 5min, CaCl2 solution (100mL, 25mM, 37degC) was dropped to the test cup. The APTT was recorded with a semi-automated blood coagulation analyzer PUN-2048A (Perlong, China). Each APTT value was averaged from three measurements.",78
1305,"A membrane (1.0x1.0cm2) was first equilibrated in physiological saline, and then put into a test cup. Fresh PPP (100mL) was added and incubated at 37degC for 3min, followed by the addition of PT agent (200mL, 37degC). The PT was determined by PUN-2048A coagulation analyzer (Perlong, China).

1306,"A membrane (1.0x1.0cm2) was equilibrated in physiological saline and put into a test cup. 200mL fresh PPP diluted with buffer solution by volume ratio of 1:10 was dropped and incubated at 37degC for 3min, followed by the addition of thrombin solution (100mL). The sample content of FIB was measured by PUN-2048A coagulation analyzer (Perlong, China). Each value was averaged from three measurements.",62
1307,"In order to detect the surface chemical components of the membranes, XPS was employed. The XPS wide-scans of M0, M3 and M6 are shown in Fig. 1A. Compared with M0, the new peaks of N 1s and Si 2p3 can be observed in the spectra of M3 and M6. In addition, with the increase of the VP and VTEOS additive, the peak intensity of N 1s and Si 2p3 increased. ATR-FTIR was also applied to characterize chemical structures of the PSf membranes, and typical spectra for M0, M3 and M6 are shown in Fig. 1B. Compared with M0, a new peak appearing at about 1660cm-1 for M3 and M6 is attributed to CO stretching (amide I band) in pyrrolidone ring of PVP. The new peaks at 3100-3700 and 948cm-1 are the absorption of SiOH stretching [42]. Both ATR-FTIR and XPS results confirmed that VP and VTEOS have been cross-linked copolymerized in PSf membranes, and with the increase of monomers additive in PSf solution, the amount of P(VP-VTEOS) anchored on the membrane surfaces increased.",173
1308,"The SEM images of the top surfaces and cross-sections for M0, M1.5, M3 and M6 are shown in Fig. 2. The cross-sessions morphology of the modified membranes changed obviously. M0 shows a dense skin layer and a porous sub-layer with a finger-like structure, then the porous structure. For the modified PSf membranes, diameter of the finger-like structure increased with the increase of monomers amount, and the skin layer of the modified membranes decreased from 1.4+-0.34 (M1.5) to 0.6+-0.27mm (M6). Although, it is difficult to found the change of the membranes surfaces from the SEM images, the pore size and porosity increased slightly with the increase of the copolymers additive as shown in Fig. 3. The results indicated that the cross-sessions morphology and pore size of the membranes were significantly affected by the copolymers content. The copolymers improved liquid-liquid phase separation and restrained sponge pores formation [43].",146
1309,"The water contact angles of the PSf membranes are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the initial contact angles of M0 is as high as 75.8deg. For the modified PSf membranes, the initial contact angle remarkably decreases from 74.0 (M1.5) to 43.5deg (M7). Furthermore, the curves of water contact angle for the modified membranes attenuate faster with drop age than that of M0. The contact angle of M7 decreases by about 12deg within 120s, as contrast, the contact angle of the original PSf membrane changed only about 3.8deg. These results suggested that the hydrophilicity of PSf membranes is improved considerably by introduction of P(VP-VTEOS). It is mainly attributed to the PVP chains and the silanol groups.",119
1310,"In dynamic ultrafiltration process, pure water flux (Jw) and protein rejection (Rprotein) were calculated and shown in Fig. 6. Both Jw and Rprotein of M0 were not recorded due to its compact structure. For the modified PSf membranes, Jw exhibits an upward trend with an increase of the additive addition. It is mainly attributed to the increase of pore size (as shown in Fig. 3), which increased water permeation. Furthermore, the improved hydrophilicity decreased the water permeation resistance. As a result, pure water flux was affected by pore size and hydrophilicity of the membranes.Rprotein changes inversely with Jw. In addition, RBSA of a membrane sample is higher than that of RLyz as shown in Fig. 6B. The trend can be mainly attributed to size exclusion and Donnan effect [47]. In order to remove middle molecules and prevent loss of albumin, M6 was preferred.",143
1311,"It is very important to improve the hemocompatibility of the membranes used in the field of blood-containing applications such as hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, plasma collection et al. [47,48]. Once blood is contacted with the foreign membrane, the blood proteins and platelets are apt to adsorb and deposit on its surfaces, leading to coagulation pathways and thrombus formation and seriously complications [6,49]. The adsorbed BSA amount on the modified PSf membranes was decreased than that of neat PSf membrane as shown in Fig. 5B and did not discuss again. Here, platelet adhesion and morphology, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and the content of fibrinogen (FIB) transferring to fibrin of M0 and M6 were investigated.",115
1312,"The typical SEM images of the platelets adhered on the surfaces of M0 and M6 are shown in Fig. 7. It can be found that the amount of adhered platelets on M0 surface is much more than that of M6. In addition, these platelets had an irregular shape, such as D-dendritic (early pseudopodia), SD-spreading dendritic (intermediate pseudopodia), S-spreading (hyaloplasm spread between pseudopodia) and FS-fully spreading (hyaloplasm extensively spread) [50], indicating the deformation and activation of platelets. For M6, few platelets are found on the membrane surfaces, and the platelets had a round morphology without pseudopodium and deformation. This should be attributed to the highly hydrophilicity of the modified PSf membrane, which prevented the adhesion and activation of platelets.",118
1313,"A detailed comparison of permeability-selectivity, anti-fouling and hemocompatibility among M6 and some different hemodiafiltration membranes are shown in Table 1. M6 has lower ABSA and prolonger APTT, which indicated that the antifouling and hemocompatibility of the modified PSf membranes were better than that of the other hemodialysis membranes. In addition, M6 is able to remove middle-molecules (lower RLyz) and prevent loss of albumin (higher RBSA), regardless of the lower water flux. Thus, the modified PSf membranes in this work had great potential to be used in hemodiafitration field. And we will further improve the performances of PSf hemodialysis membranes in our future reports.",103
1314,"PSf membranes with improved antifouling and hemocompatibility were successfully fabricated via a simple process combining in situ cross-linked polymerization and the traditional NIPS technique. Water contact angle results suggested enhanced hydrophilicity of the modified PSf membranes, compared to neat PSf membrane. Dynamic protein filtration experiments confirmed the improved antifouling ability of the prepared membranes. In addition, the results of protein adsorption, platelet adhesion and clotting time indicated that the modified PSf membrane exhibited enhanced hemocompatibility, which might be attributed to the reaction or combination between the hydrophilic surfaces and the coagulation factors in plasma. The modified PSf membranes with enhanced hydrophilicity, antifouling and hemocompatibility properties can be applied in hemodiafitration field. Moreover, the in situ cross-linked polymerization method can be extended to other polymeric materials.",125
