16,"To improve the solvent resistance as well as the mechanical performance of PSU-based membranes, a post-crosslinking process is often required. Electron-beam irradiation was proposed [7] which, however, requires expensive equipment and induces damage of the membrane structure during irradiation. Alternatively, UV-irradiation was adopted and mixtures of PSU and acrylic cross-linker were thus investigated [8,9]. In these works, acrylic cross-linkers and photoinitiators are added to the PSU casting solution. Both additives are chosen in such a way that they do not leach out from the polymer matrix to the non-solvent bath during the NIPS process. The formed membranes are then UV-irradiated after phase inversion. A different but more elegant approach could involve the incorporation of cross-linkable functionalities on the PSU-backbone. In general, the chemical incorporation of functional groups into PSUs can be achieved through two approaches, namely (i) by using functional co-monomers during polycondensation [10-14], and (ii) by post-synthesis modification [15-24].",150,y,0.80055475
