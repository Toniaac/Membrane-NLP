For the preparation of AP-DM1 membrane, APSf (1.00 g), AIBN (0.10 g), PSf (1.00 g), and DMA (1.00 g) were dissolved in 10.3 mL of NMP in a 100 mL dried Schlenk flask containing a magnetic stir bar. PSf is the commercial polysulfone, and it was intentionally used to increase the stability of the membrane. The flask was sealed with a septum and deoxygenated with nitrogen for 1 h. The flask was then placed in an 80 degC oil bath, and stirred with a magnetic stir bar for 6 h for the polymerization of the vinyl groups in APSf and DMA resulting in a clear brown solution. After the polymerization, the resulting solution was left in sonication at degassing mode for 2 h to remove the air bubbles trapped within the solution, followed by casting on a non-woven polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric using a doctor blade at a thickness of 200 mm, and then immersed into DI water bath at room temperature.

Meanwhile, in the preparation process of the bare PSf membrane, more dilute casting solution was used than that used for the preparation of AP-DM# membranes, because commercial PSf has larger molecular weight than APSf (50,000 and 5,300 g/mol are the Mn values for polysulfone and APSf, respectively).
